The court order in question pertains to a case where two individuals were appointed as Assistant Teachers in a Junior High School, but their salary was stopped by the Basic Shiksha Adhikari and the Committee of Management. The State-respondents alleged that the posts against which the appellants were appointed were never sanctioned/created by the Basic Shiksha Adhikari and that the Management, in collusion with the appellants, had cooked up the matter and appointed the appellants against non-sanctioned posts.

The court found that the appointment of the appellants was an outcome of collusion and fraud, and therefore, their appointment was void ab initio. The court dismissed the appeal, finding no error in the order passed by the learned Single Judge.

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and protocols when it comes to appointments and hiring. The court found that the appellants were appointed against non-sanctioned posts, which is a clear violation of the rules and regulations governing such appointments. The fact that the Management was involved in this collusion only adds to the severity of the situation.

The court's decision to declare the appointment void ab initio is significant, as it means that the appointment was never valid in the first place. This has serious implications for the appellants, as they will not be entitled to any salary or benefits that they may have received during their tenure as Assistant Teachers. It also serves as a warning to others who may be tempted to engage in similar fraudulent activities.

The court's dismissal of the appeal indicates that it found no merit in the arguments put forth by the appellants. This suggests that the court was convinced by the State-respondents' allegations of collusion and fraud, and that it believed that the appellants were not entitled to the positions they held.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and protocols when it comes to appointments and hiring. It also highlights the severe consequences that can result from engaging in fraudulent activities, such as collusion. The court's decision to declare the appointment void ab initio sends a strong message that such activities will not be tolerated, and that those who engage in them will be held accountable.
