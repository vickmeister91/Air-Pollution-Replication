The court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s Ultra Home Construction Pvt. Ltd. and others seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint alleged that the accused had started construction of a commercial complex without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The court allowed the petition, stating that the clearance certificate had been obtained by the petitioners later on after starting the construction and hence, the criminal proceedings against them were liable to be quashed. The court cited the case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal to support its decision.

The court order explains that the High Court can use its powers under Article 226 or Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to prevent abuse of the court process or to secure justice. The court provides examples of cases where such powers can be exercised, including cases where the allegations do not constitute an offense, where there is no evidence of an offense, where there is a legal bar to the proceedings, or where the proceedings are maliciously instituted. The court warns that such powers should be used sparingly and not arbitrarily. In the present case, the court quashes a criminal complaint against the petitioners for allegedly starting a construction project without obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate, as the petitioners had already obtained the certificate before the complaint was filed, and the allegations were vague and did not specify how the offense had been committed.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining environmental clearance before starting any construction project. The Environment Protection Act, 1986, mandates that any person or organization undertaking any construction activity that is likely to have an impact on the environment must obtain prior clearance from the concerned authorities. Failure to obtain such clearance can result in criminal proceedings being initiated against the accused.

In the present case, the accused had started construction of a commercial complex without obtaining prior environmental clearance. However, they had obtained the clearance certificate later on after starting the construction. The court, therefore, quashed the criminal proceedings against them, as they had rectified their mistake by obtaining the clearance certificate. The court cited the case of State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal to support its decision. In this case, the Supreme Court had held that the High Court can use its powers under Article 226 or Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to prevent abuse of the court process or to secure justice.
