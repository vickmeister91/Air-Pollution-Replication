The court order pertains to two criminal revision cases where the accused challenged the order of the trial court allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination. In the first case, the accused, Akhileshwar Dayal Bhargava, argued that the application was filed after a long delay and was a delaying tactic. The prosecution argued that the witnesses were material and their testimony was essential for a just decision. The court noted that while the witnesses were material, the order on the application was interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision. The court cited previous judgments to support its decision.

In the second case, the accused had filed a revision petition against an order allowing the application of the State to recall certain witnesses under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court cited previous judgments to establish that such orders are of an interlocutory nature and cannot be challenged in revision. The court dismissed the revision petition as not maintainable and ordered the trial court record to be sent back to the concerned court.

The issue at hand in both cases was whether the orders allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination were maintainable for revision. The accused in both cases argued that the orders were interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the witnesses were material and their testimony was essential for a just decision.

The court, in both cases, agreed with the prosecution that the witnesses were material and their testimony was essential for a just decision. However, the court also noted that the orders allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination were interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision.

The court cited previous judgments to support its decision. In the first case, the court cited the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, where it was held that an order allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination was interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision. In the second case, the court cited the case of State of Rajasthan v. Shambhu Kewat, where it was held that an order allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination was of an interlocutory nature and could not be challenged in revision.

The court's decision in both cases was based on the principle that orders allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination were interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision. The court noted that the accused could challenge such orders in an appeal against the final judgment.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two criminal revision cases where the accused challenged the order of the trial court allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination. The court, in both cases, held that the orders allowing the prosecution to recall witnesses for cross-examination were interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable for revision. The court cited previous judgments to support its decision and noted that the accused could challenge such orders in an appeal against the final judgment.
