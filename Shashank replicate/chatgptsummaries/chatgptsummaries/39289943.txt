The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Mahesh, who is accused of killing a tiger along with co-accused persons and is facing charges under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. The co-accused persons have stated that they received the tiger's nails, tooth, and jaws from Mahesh. The state opposed the bail application, stating that Mahesh was absconding for two years. However, the court allowed the application, directing that Mahesh be released on anticipatory bail on the condition of furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount.

The case against Mahesh and his co-accused persons is related to the killing of a tiger, which is a protected animal under the Wild Life Protection Act. The co-accused persons have stated that they received the tiger's nails, tooth, and jaws from Mahesh, indicating his involvement in the killing. The state has opposed Mahesh's bail application, stating that he was absconding for two years, which shows his intention to evade the law.

However, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Mahesh, which means that he will not be arrested if he complies with the conditions set by the court. The court has directed Mahesh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. This means that Mahesh will have to provide a guarantee that he will appear in court when required and will not abscond.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Mahesh has been criticized by some wildlife activists, who argue that it sends a wrong message to poachers and wildlife traffickers. They believe that the court should have taken a stricter stance on wildlife crimes and not allowed bail to someone accused of killing a protected animal.

However, the court's decision is based on the legal principles of bail, which are designed to balance the interests of the accused and the state. The court has considered Mahesh's right to liberty and his presumption of innocence until proven guilty, as well as the state's interest in ensuring that he appears in court and does not evade the law.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Mahesh, who is accused of killing a tiger along with co-accused persons and is facing charges under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has directed Mahesh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. While some wildlife activists have criticized the court's decision, it is based on the legal principles of bail and balances the interests of the accused and the state.
