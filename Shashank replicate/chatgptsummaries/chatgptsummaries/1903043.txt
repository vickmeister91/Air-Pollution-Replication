In a recent court order, a dispute between two parties over a right of way along a pathway was addressed. The appellants had previously obtained a decree preventing the respondents from interfering with their right of way, but later alleged that the respondents had obstructed the pathway. The lower court had given the appellants a decree directing the respondents to remove the obstructions, but the higher court overturned this decision.

The higher court stated that the rule allowing for the removal of obstructions only applied to mandatory injunctions, not prohibitory injunctions like the one in this case. As a result, the court dismissed the appeal without costs.

The dispute between the parties centered around a right of way along a pathway. The appellants had previously obtained a decree preventing the respondents from interfering with their right of way. However, the appellants later alleged that the respondents had obstructed the pathway, which led to the current dispute.

The lower court had given the appellants a decree directing the respondents to remove the obstructions. However, the higher court overturned this decision, stating that the rule allowing for the removal of obstructions only applied to mandatory injunctions, not prohibitory injunctions like the one in this case.

A mandatory injunction is an order that requires a party to take a specific action, while a prohibitory injunction is an order that prohibits a party from taking a specific action. In this case, the appellants had obtained a prohibitory injunction preventing the respondents from interfering with their right of way. The lower court had then issued a mandatory injunction requiring the respondents to remove the obstructions.

The higher court's decision was based on the fact that the rule allowing for the removal of obstructions only applied to mandatory injunctions. The court stated that the rule was intended to prevent a party from benefiting from their own wrongdoing. In the case of a mandatory injunction, the party who has been ordered to take a specific action has already committed a wrongdoing by failing to do so. Therefore, the rule allows for the removal of any obstructions that may prevent the party from complying with the injunction.

However, in the case of a prohibitory injunction, the party who has been ordered not to take a specific action has not committed any wrongdoing by failing to do so. Therefore, the rule allowing for the removal of obstructions does not apply in this case.

As a result of the higher court's decision, the appeal was dismissed without costs. This means that the appellants will not be required to pay any costs associated with the appeal. The decision also means that the respondents will not be required to remove the obstructions along the pathway.

In conclusion, the recent court order addressed a dispute between two parties over a right of way along a pathway. The higher court overturned the lower court's decision, stating that the rule allowing for the removal of obstructions only applied to mandatory injunctions, not prohibitory injunctions like the one in this case. As a result, the appeal was dismissed without costs.
