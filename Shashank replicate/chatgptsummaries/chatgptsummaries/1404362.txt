The recent court order in the case between Paramudhyog and the State of Gujarat pertains to the obtaining of a No Objection Certificate for industrial activities and mining in forest areas. The court found that a government resolution from 2008 was contrary to the directions issued by the Supreme Court in 2006, which required a safety zone of 1km around sanctuaries and national parks. The court directed the government to issue a corrigendum to the resolution and to stop any mining or industrial activity within 1km of these areas. 

The court's decision is a significant victory for environmental protection in India. The safety zone of 1km around sanctuaries and national parks is crucial for the protection of wildlife and their habitats. The court's decision ensures that this safety zone is maintained and that industrial activities and mining do not encroach upon it. 

The government was also directed to give publicity to the resolution and its corrigendum. This is an important step in ensuring that the public is aware of the court's decision and the need to protect the environment. The government must take proactive steps to ensure that the public is informed about the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. 

In addition, the court directed the government to constitute a high power committee to ensure the implementation of the court's decision. This committee will play a crucial role in monitoring the implementation of the court's decision and ensuring that the safety zone around sanctuaries and national parks is maintained. 

The court's decision is a reminder that environmental protection is a crucial issue that must be taken seriously. The government must take proactive steps to protect the environment and ensure that industrial activities and mining do not harm wildlife and their habitats. The court appreciated the efforts of the government pleader and assistant government pleader in the matter, but it is important that the government takes proactive steps to ensure that the court's decision is implemented effectively. 

Overall, the court's decision is a significant victory for environmental protection in India. It ensures that the safety zone around sanctuaries and national parks is maintained and that industrial activities and mining do not encroach upon it. The government must take proactive steps to ensure that the court's decision is implemented effectively and that the public is aware of the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The constitution of a high power committee to monitor the implementation of the court's decision is a positive step in this direction.
