The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The case against Banti Adiwasi was related to the violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The applicant was arrested based on the confessional statement of a co-accused, which is not admissible as evidence in the court of law. The State counsel conceded that there is no admissible evidence against the applicant except for the co-accused's statement. The court, therefore, granted bail to the applicant.

The court directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and one surety in the like amount to appear before the court on the given dates. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that the applicant will have to appear before the court on the given dates and comply with all the conditions of the bail order. If the applicant fails to comply with the conditions of the bail order, the order will become ineffective, and the applicant will be arrested again.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on the principle of natural justice. The principle of natural justice requires that no person should be punished without a fair trial. In this case, the applicant was arrested based on the confessional statement of a co-accused, which is not admissible as evidence. Therefore, the court had no admissible evidence against the applicant, and the applicant was entitled to bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is also based on the presumption of innocence. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law. It means that every person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. In this case, the applicant was arrested based on the confessional statement of a co-accused, which is not admissible as evidence. Therefore, the court had no admissible evidence against the applicant, and the applicant was presumed to be innocent.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is also based on the fact that the applicant is not a flight risk. The court directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and one surety in the like amount to appear before the court on the given dates. This means that the court is satisfied that the applicant will appear before the court on the given dates and will not flee from justice.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Banti Adiwasi, who was arrested in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The applicant was implicated based on the confessional statement of a co-accused, which is not admissible as evidence. The State counsel conceded that there is no admissible evidence against the applicant except for the co-accused's statement.
