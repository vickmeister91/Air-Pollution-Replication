The court orders discussed in this summary cover a range of cases related to land ownership, building permissions, and illegal constructions. In the first case, Nilofer Khan and Kalim Khan appealed a notice issued by the Municipal Corporation of Ujjain, which rejected their application for compounding building permission. The appellants claimed ownership of the land based on an agreement executed in 1996, but the Municipal Corporation rejected their application on the grounds that they did not own the entire land. The court order provides details of the legal proceedings initiated by both parties and the ownership of the land in question.

The second court order outlines the various documents and evidence required for proving right, title, or interest in land or plot. It emphasizes the need for attested copies of sale deeds, lease deeds, khasra plans, and khatauni records, as well as proof of title and accompanying documents with every notice. The order also refers to specific sections of the law and the need for proper documentation to establish ownership.

The third court order pertains to a case where the appellants were directed to demolish illegal constructions on land that they did not own and for which they did not have the necessary building permissions. The respondents had issued a show cause notice, which was rejected, and the appellants were directed to demolish the constructions. The appellants challenged this order by filing a writ petition, but it was found that the illegal constructions were on land owned by others and that no development permission had been obtained for the same. The court upheld the order for demolition.

The fourth court order states that the illegal construction is on land that does not belong to the appellants and no development permission has been obtained for the said land. The appellants have only obtained development permission for a specific area of land, but no building permission has been obtained for any land. The court also mentions that the appellants have failed to establish ownership of certain land and therefore their application for compounding is not maintainable. The court dismisses the writ petition and mentions that the petitioners cannot get the benefit of Section 185 and 190 of the MPLR Code. The court also mentions that a show cause notice was issued for the illegal construction and the details of the same are mentioned in the notice.

The fifth court order discusses a dispute over illegal construction on a disputed property. The petitioners claim that their construction should be allowed under the Compounding Rules of 2016, but the court finds that they do not have clear title to the property and their application for compounding has already been rejected. The court cites previous cases to emphasize the importance of preventing unauthorized constructions and holding officials accountable for their failure to do so. The court directs the petitioners to provide details of their pending writ petitions for regularization and the developers from whom they purchased the flats. Failure to comply will result in the dismissal of their special leave petitions.

The final court order discusses a case where a corporation argued that draft regulations from 1989 did not apply to a hotel project, and that the 1991 regulations did not provide for additional FSI. The court ruled that the 1991 regulations did not apply, and that the draft regulations from 1989 were not in force at the time and therefore did not apply either. The court also noted that the phrase "any other law" in the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 includes the MRTP Act of 1966, and that the draft regulations of 1989 would not apply to the plot in question. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of proper documentation and ownership in land-related cases, as well as the consequences of unauthorized constructions. They also emphasize the need for officials to be held accountable for their failure to prevent such constructions.
