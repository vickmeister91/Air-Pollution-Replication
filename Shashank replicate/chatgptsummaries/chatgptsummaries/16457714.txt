The case in question involves a petitioner who is the accused in a criminal case. The petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. challenging the order passed by the IV Addl. Civil Judge & JMFC, Gulbarga in C.C.No.1109/2009. The prosecution had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to produce documents pertaining to a loan account in the name of the petitioner's wife. The trial court allowed the application, and the petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that it violated Sections 173 and 207 of Cr.P.C.

The petitioner's argument was that the prosecution's application was not in accordance with the provisions of Sections 173 and 207 of Cr.P.C. Section 173 of Cr.P.C. deals with the investigation of a case by the police, while Section 207 of Cr.P.C. deals with the supply of copies of police reports and other documents to the accused. The petitioner argued that the prosecution's application was not in accordance with these provisions because it did not relate to any document that was part of the police report or that had been supplied to the accused.

The court, however, dismissed the petitioner's argument and upheld the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court was justified in allowing the prosecution's application to summon the documents from another court. The court observed that Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing in the possession of any person. The court further observed that the trial court had allowed the prosecution's application after considering the relevance of the documents to the case and the fact that they were not in the possession of the prosecution.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the relevance of the documents to the case. The court held that the trial court had acted within its jurisdiction in allowing the prosecution's application and that there was no ground to interfere with the order.

In conclusion, the court upheld the trial court's order allowing the prosecution's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to produce documents pertaining to a loan account in the name of the petitioner's wife. The court held that the trial court was justified in allowing the application and that there was no ground to interfere with the order. The court's decision reinforces the importance of following the provisions of Cr.P.C. and the need to consider the relevance of documents to a case before allowing their production.
