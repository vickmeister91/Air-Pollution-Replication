The court recently granted bail to two individuals, Babulal and another person, who were charged under Sections 9, 29, and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that the two were found in possession of 5 kg flesh of a wild animal, specifically a blue-bull. Despite the serious nature of the charges, the court considered several factors before granting bail.

Firstly, the court noted that the charge sheet had already been filed, indicating that the investigation was complete and there was no immediate need to keep the accused in custody. Additionally, the court took into account the fact that the accused had no prior criminal record, which suggested that they were not a flight risk or a danger to society.

Based on these considerations, the court granted bail to Babulal and the other accused on the condition that they furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 each, along with one surety each of the same amount. The accused were also directed to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires them to attend all court hearings and not interfere with the investigation.

The decision to grant bail in this case is significant because it highlights the importance of considering all relevant factors before making a decision. While the charges against the accused were serious, the court recognized that they were entitled to the presumption of innocence and that their past conduct suggested that they were not a threat to society.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder that the criminal justice system must balance the need to protect society with the rights of the accused. By carefully considering all relevant factors, the court was able to make a fair and just decision in this case.
