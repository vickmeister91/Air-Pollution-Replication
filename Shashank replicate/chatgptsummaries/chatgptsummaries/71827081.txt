The court order in question pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Rajesh Kumar against the Union of India and others seeking a direction against the grant of approval of diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The petitioner had objected to the cutting of trees for setting up a petrol pump on forest land and had sent a complaint to the Forest Department. The court held that the writ petition was premature as the petitioner had already filed objections to the concerned authority and there was no reason to presume that his objections would not be taken into account. The petition was disposed of without prejudice to the objections of the petitioner being considered in accordance with the law.

The case at hand involves the issue of diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The petitioner, Rajesh Kumar, had filed a civil writ petition against the Union of India and others seeking a direction against the grant of approval of diversion of forest land for setting up a petrol pump. The petitioner had objected to the cutting of trees for this purpose and had sent a complaint to the Forest Department.

The court, however, held that the writ petition was premature as the petitioner had already filed objections to the concerned authority and there was no reason to presume that his objections would not be taken into account. The court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court. The court further observed that the petitioner had not shown any exceptional circumstances that would warrant the court's intervention at this stage.

The court also noted that the Forest Department had not yet taken a final decision on the matter and that the petitioner's objections were still under consideration. The court held that it would be premature to interfere in the matter at this stage and that the petitioner should wait for the decision of the Forest Department.

The court disposed of the petition without prejudice to the objections of the petitioner being considered in accordance with the law. This means that the petitioner's objections would still be considered by the Forest Department and that the petitioner could approach the court again if he was not satisfied with the decision of the Forest Department.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Rajesh Kumar against the Union of India and others seeking a direction against the grant of approval of diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court held that the writ petition was premature as the petitioner had already filed objections to the concerned authority and there was no reason to presume that his objections would not be taken into account. The court disposed of the petition without prejudice to the objections of the petitioner being considered in accordance with the law.
