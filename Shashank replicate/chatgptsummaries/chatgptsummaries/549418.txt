The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a registered society seeking a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to issue one hectare of agricultural land in Venkatayapalem Forest Blocks I, II and III within the jurisdiction of Papayapalem forest section, Bellamkonda Mandal, Guntur District, to the members of the petitioner society. The petitioner society claimed that they had a legally enforceable right to claim forest land and sought the court's intervention in assigning the land to them. However, the court held that the petitioner society has no legally enforceable right to claim forest land and, therefore, the writ petition seeking assignment of forest land is not maintainable.

The court order discusses various cases related to forest conservation and the need for prior approval from the Central Government for any non-forest activity within forest areas. The court cites examples of cases where forest land cannot be assigned or used for non-forest purposes without the Central Government's permission. The court also directs all High Courts to ensure strict compliance with the orders passed by the Supreme Court.

The court held that forest land is a valuable natural resource and its conservation is of utmost importance. The court cited various laws and regulations related to forest conservation and emphasized the need to protect forest land from any non-forest activity. The court also noted that the government has a duty to protect forest land and ensure its conservation.

The court further held that the petitioner society's claim for assignment of forest land is not maintainable as there is no legally enforceable right to claim forest land. The court noted that forest land is a national asset and cannot be assigned to any individual or organization without following due process and obtaining necessary approvals.

The court also held that there is no duty cast upon the Government of Andhra Pradesh to send proposals for assignment of forest land. The court noted that the government has the discretion to decide whether or not to send proposals for assignment of forest land and that the court cannot interfere with the government's decision in this regard.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner society seeking assignment of forest land. The court emphasized the need to protect forest land and ensure its conservation and directed all High Courts to ensure strict compliance with the orders passed by the Supreme Court related to forest conservation. The court also reiterated that forest land is a national asset and cannot be assigned to any individual or organization without following due process and obtaining necessary approvals.
