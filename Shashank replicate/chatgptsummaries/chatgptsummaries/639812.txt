The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner requested permission to cut down 14 unproductive mango trees on his ralyati land, which is classified as a garden. The trees were old, unproductive, and affected by parasites, and the petitioner wanted to renovate the garden by planting new saplings. However, the local police and BLLRO prevented him from doing so, citing a ban on felling trees. The petitioner argued that the ban did not apply to non-forest private plantations, as per a Supreme Court decision. 

The court agreed with the petitioner's argument, stating that the ban on felling trees in forests did not apply to non-forest private plantations, as per the Supreme Court's specific direction. However, the court noted that some directions in a later Division Bench decision were at variance with the Supreme Court's directions. Therefore, the court established a committee to issue guidelines and prepare a management plan for the plantation of trees, including guidelines for felling trees. 

The court clarified that the ban on felling trees in forests does not apply to non-forest private plantations, but there are statutory provisions in place to regulate the felling of trees in such areas. The court directed that a raiyat (landowner) may cut down and replace old, uneconomic, or unproductive trees in a ratio of 1:10 (or 1:5 for gardens with less than 10 trees) once every two years, with notice given to the Collector of the district and an undertaking to replace the trees with new saplings. The Collector may inspect and take action if there is a violation of the norms regarding the ratio and periodicity of cutting trees or any other violation of the provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act.

Furthermore, the court order states that cutting of trees is allowed but only after giving one month notice to the Collector and recording necessary details. The Collector may inspect the area if desired. Violation of this order or any provisions of the West Bengal Land Reforms Act may result in appropriate legal action. The court also suggests that the State Government should consider enacting a comprehensive law for felling trees in non-forest areas. 

The order applies to several cases and has been disposed of. The court's decision provides clarity on the issue of felling trees in non-forest private plantations and establishes guidelines for the same. The court's direction to establish a committee to issue guidelines and prepare a management plan for the plantation of trees is a positive step towards sustainable management of trees in non-forest areas. 

The court's decision also highlights the need for a comprehensive law for felling trees in non-forest areas. Such a law would provide a framework for sustainable management of trees in non-forest areas and ensure that the rights of landowners are protected while also ensuring the protection of the environment. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case provides clarity on the issue of felling trees in non-forest private plantations and establishes guidelines for the same. The court's direction to establish a committee to issue guidelines and prepare a management plan for the plantation of trees is a positive step towards sustainable management of trees in non-forest areas. The court's suggestion for a comprehensive law for felling trees in non-forest areas is also a welcome move towards ensuring the protection of the environment while also protecting the rights of landowners.
