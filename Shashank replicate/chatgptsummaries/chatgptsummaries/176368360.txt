The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently received three petitions for quashing an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate in Dewas, which took cognizance against the applicants under Sections 44 and 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The applicants argued that there was no averment in the complaint as to how they were connected with the offence. The non-applicant argued that the applicants were equally liable to the conduct of the non-applicant company. The court examined the facts of the case and referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal V/s. CBI. The court concluded that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the company would be imputed to the company/corporation. The court dismissed the petitions.

The case in question involved a company and its directors who were accused of violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The applicants, who were directors of the company, argued that there was no evidence to suggest that they were connected to the offence. The non-applicant argued that the directors were equally liable for the conduct of the company. The court examined the facts of the case and referred to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal V/s. CBI. The court concluded that the criminal intent of the "alter ego" of the company would be imputed to the company/corporation. The court dismissed the petitions.

The court order pertains to a case where the applicants, who are directors of a company, were issued a process under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. without any incriminating evidence against them. The court held that when a company is accused, its directors can only be held liable if there is sufficient incriminating evidence against them coupled with criminal intent or the statutory regime attracts the doctrine of vicarious liability. As there was no such evidence against the applicants, the order of issuing process against them was set aside. However, the court clarified that if sufficient incriminating material surfaces during the trial, the CJM can exercise his powers to rope in the applicants. The impugned order against the applicants was set aside with liberty.
