The court order pertains to multiple appeals against a common order passed by the City Civil Judge in Mumbai. The judge had held that the plaint in a suit was bound to be rejected as pre-suit statutory notices required under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act were not issued and served upon the public authorities. The suit pertained to the redevelopment of a chawl in Mumbai, and the plaintiffs had entered into an agreement with the developer for the same. The court order provides details of the agreement and the events leading up to the suit.

In another case, the court order pertains to a situation where two buildings were constructed for rehabilitation, but the occupation certificate was not obtained by defendant no.3. The tenants and occupants of Afzal chawl forcibly took possession of different rooms without following the procedure of lottery as agreed. Defendant no.3 paid compensation towards rent for transit accommodation till 31.3.2009. The plaintiffs were entitled to a minimum area of 27.88 sq.mts. in the newly constructed building as permanent alternate accommodation in lieu of their old premises under Rule 4 of Appendix IIIA. The plaintiffs prayed for a declaration that they are entitled to all the benefits of redevelopment under Development Control Regulation 33(7) read along with Appendix III of Development Control Regulation. They also prayed for an injunction against defendant no.3, not to create third party interest in respect of the premises to which plaintiffs are entitled.

The court order directs the defendant to vacate and hand over possession of a flat to the plaintiffs. The defendants are also restrained from creating any third-party interest in the plaintiffs' permanent alternate accommodation. The defendants are directed to pay compensation for temporary alternate accommodation. The appellant argues that pre-suit statutory notices were not required, while the MMC argues that they were mandatory. The court has jurisdiction to try all civil suits unless barred.

The court order discusses the requirement of pre-suit statutory notice under Section 527 of the MMC Act and Section 164 of the MCS Act, 1960. It states that such notices serve a public purpose by giving public authorities an opportunity to avoid unnecessary litigation and expenses. The court emphasizes that waiver of pre-suit statutory notice is contrary to law and cannot be waived by contract. The order also mentions that the mandate of law contained in Section 527 of the MMC Act against the institution of a suit requires obedience by prospective plaintiffs.

The court order states that prospective plaintiffs must obey the requirements of issuing and serving pre-suit statutory notices, as it serves a public purpose. The court rejects the plaintiff's claim due to non-compliance with the mandatory requirements, but they can file a fresh plaint after fulfilling the requirements. The rejection of the plaint does not preclude the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. The court dismisses the appeals and rejects the prayer of continuation of the statement made by the learned advocate for respondent no.4. Civil Application No.1031 of 2013 stands disposed of.

In summary, the court order pertains to multiple appeals against a common order passed by the City Civil Judge in Mumbai. The court emphasizes the importance of pre-suit statutory notices under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, stating that they serve a public purpose by giving public authorities an opportunity to avoid unnecessary litigation and expenses. The court rejects the plaintiff's claim due to non-compliance with the mandatory requirements but allows them to file a fresh plaint after fulfilling the requirements. The court also directs the defendant to vacate and hand over possession of a flat to the plaintiffs and pay compensation for temporary alternate accommodation. The court dismisses the appeals and rejects the prayer of continuation of the statement made by the learned advocate for respondent no.4.
