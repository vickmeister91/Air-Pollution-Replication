The revisional court had dismissed the revision petition of the petitioner filed against the order passed by learned Additional Judicial Magistrate Pratapgarh whereby the application filed under Section 311, 91 of the Cr.P.C. and Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act by the petitioner was dismissed. The court held that the impugned order is well justified, hence, no interference is called for and dismissed the petition.
