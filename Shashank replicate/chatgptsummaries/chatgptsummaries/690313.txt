The first court order pertains to a case between Lalji Raja & Sons and Firm Hansraj Nathuram. The appellants obtained a decree against the respondent in the court of Sub-Judge, Bankura (West Bengal) on December 3, 1949. The judgment debtors resisted the execution petition on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to execute the same as the decree was that of a foreign court and that the same had been passed ex-parte. The court accepted that contention and dismissed the execution petition on December 29, 1950. The questions which fell for consideration were whether the decree under execution was not executable by courts situate in the area comprised in the former State of Madhya Bharat and whether the decree was barred by s. 48 of the Code. The court held that the decree was executable and that the execution was not barred by s. 48 of the Code.

The second court order is regarding an execution appeal. The decree-holders obtained a decree against the respondents in the court of Sub-Judge, Bankura for a sum of over Rs. 12,000/-, on December 3, 1949. The judgment-debtors resisted the execution on various grounds, but the learned Additional District Judge rejected the objections raised by the judgment-debtors. The judgment-debtors appealed against that order to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The High Court agreed with the executing court that the execution petition is neither barred by res-judicata nor by s. 48 of "the Code\', nor is there any bar of limitation. But it disagreed with that court and held that the decree was not executable as the court which passed the decree was a foreign court.

The third court order discusses the execution of a decree in India and the transfer of the decree to another court for execution. The court clarifies that a decree can only be transferred to a court governed by the Indian Code of Civil Procedure. The court also examines whether the non-executability of the decree in a particular territory can be considered a right accrued under the repealed law. The court concludes that the non-executability of the decree cannot be considered a vested right of the judgment-debtors. The court also examines the applicability of Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure and concludes that the decree-holders can take the benefit of Section 14(2) of the Limitation Act.

The fourth court order discusses the time limit for enforcing a judgment or decree, which is twelve years from the date of the order or from the date of revival, payment, or acknowledgment of the right to enforce. The court also considers the provisions of the Limitation Act of 1908 and the Code of Civil Procedure, and concludes that the period prescribed under the Code is a period of limitation. The court allows the appeal and directs the executing court to proceed with the execution, and the respondents are ordered to pay the costs of the appellants.

The fifth court order states that the Bankura decree is no longer valid and cannot be considered under Section 20(c) of the Amendment Act. The decree was executable by the court that passed it or the court to which it was transferred. Since the Code is applicable to the whole of India, the decree is no longer foreign to the Morena Court. The plea that Section 48 Civil Procedure Code presents a bar of limitation is also not tenable. The appeal is allowed.

In summary, these court orders deal with various aspects of executing a decree in India. The first order deals with the jurisdiction of the court to execute a foreign decree, while the second order deals with the executability of a decree passed by a foreign court. The third order clarifies the transfer of a decree to another court for execution, while the fourth order deals with the time limit for enforcing a judgment or decree. The fifth order deals with the validity of a decree and the applicability of Section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Overall, these court orders provide important insights into the legal framework governing the execution of decrees in India.
