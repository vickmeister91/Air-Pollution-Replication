The court orders discussed in this summary relate to the appointment of Noon Meal Organizers in schools and the role of the State Government and school management in this process. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by B. Saraswathy Amma challenging an order passed by the District Collector and the Commissioner for Panchayat Union regarding the appointment of a nutritious meal organizer for the petitioner's Higher Secondary School in Kanyakumari District. The petitioner sought to quash the orders and direct the second respondent to appoint a nutritious meal organizer for the school in accordance with G.O.Ms.No.294, Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme (NMP I) Department, dated 20.11.1993. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the management of the school had no right to appoint a noon meal staff and that the appointment of staff must be subjected to the touchstone of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.

The second court order discusses the procedure for appointing Noon Meal Organizers in schools. The court has taken away the power of issuing appointment orders from the Correspondent/Headmaster of the school and directed that the appointment order be issued in the name of the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the Collector. The court has also constituted a selection committee consisting of the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the Collector as Chairman, the Correspondent/Headmaster of the concerned school, and the Commissioner of the concerned Panchayat Union as members. The court has directed that a panel of five names from the Aided Minority/Non-minority schools be considered by the selection committee. The court has also clarified that the appointments made before the issuance of the Government Order, dated 6.7.2010, will continue to be based upon the earlier pattern of appointment as approved by the division bench in (2008) 1 MLJ 726.

The third court order states that the school authorities will send five names for the position of Noon Meal Organiser within four weeks, and the authorities of the Collector will take further action within four weeks to select one of those five persons. The court emphasizes that no legal issue was decided and refers to previous cases where the District Collector's discretion in selecting a suitable candidate was upheld. The court also notes that appointments made in accordance with the guidelines and principles of Articles 14 and 16 cannot be disturbed, and that the State Government cannot barter away public employment to any private school. The court further emphasizes the importance of reservation for underprivileged sections of society in such employment.

The fourth court order states that the State Government cannot delegate its power of employment to any private agency and must follow the constitutional scheme of communal roster in public employment. The management of minority schools cannot have a say in the appointment of noon meal staff as it is entirely executed by the State Government for the welfare of children. The court directs the State Government to withdraw a particular order and bring employment in line with the constitutional scheme. The court dismisses a writ petition challenging the appointment procedure of noon meal staff in a school. The court cites previous judgments to support its decision that the creation and sanction of posts is the prerogative of the executive, and the courts cannot arrogate to themselves a purely executive power.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of following the constitutional scheme of communal roster in public employment and ensuring that appointments are made in accordance with the guidelines and principles of Articles 14 and 16. The court has taken away the power of school management in appointing Noon Meal Organizers and directed that the appointment order be issued in the name of the Personal Assistant (NMP) to the Collector. The court has also emphasized the importance of reservation for underprivileged sections of society in such employment and directed the State Government to withdraw a particular order and bring employment in line with the constitutional scheme. Overall, these court orders aim to ensure that the appointment of Noon Meal Organizers in schools is done in a fair and transparent manner, with due consideration given to the principles of equality and social justice.
