The Bombay High Court recently granted permission to M/S Shree Om Enterprises to withdraw their writ petition and approach the Green Tribunal under Section 33-B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court kept all questions open, indicating that the petitioner could raise any issues before the Green Tribunal.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is an important piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act.

Section 33-B of the Act deals with the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and provides that any person aggrieved by an order or decision of a pollution control board may approach the NGT for relief. The NGT has the power to hear and dispose of such applications and can pass orders for the prevention and control of pollution.

In the case of M/S Shree Om Enterprises, the petitioner had filed a writ petition before the Bombay High Court challenging an order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The order had directed the petitioner to pay a penalty for violating the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The petitioner had argued that the order was arbitrary and had been passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard. They had also contended that the MPCB had not followed the due process of law while passing the order.

However, during the hearing of the case, the petitioner expressed their desire to withdraw the writ petition and approach the NGT under Section 33-B of the Act. The court allowed the petitioner to do so and kept all questions open, indicating that the petitioner could raise any issues before the NGT.

This decision of the Bombay High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of the NGT in dealing with environmental disputes. The NGT has been established as a specialized forum for the resolution of environmental disputes and has the expertise to deal with complex environmental issues.

Moreover, the decision also emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws in India. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the environment and ensure sustainable development. The Act provides for stringent penalties for violations and empowers the pollution control boards to take action against polluters.

In conclusion, the decision of the Bombay High Court to allow M/S Shree Om Enterprises to withdraw their writ petition and approach the NGT under Section 33-B of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a significant development in the field of environmental law. The decision highlights the importance of the NGT in dealing with environmental disputes and emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws in India.
