The court order in question pertains to a case where the defendant failed to appear in court on the adjourned date, resulting in an ex parte decree being passed against him. The defendant subsequently filed an application to set aside the decree, but this was rejected by both the trial court and the court of appeal. The defendant argued that the adjournment of the case from the original date was illegal and outside the powers of the officer who ordered it.

The court examined the legality of the adjournment and found that it was not illegal or improper for the chief ministerial officer to adjourn the case to a later date if authorized by the presiding officer. The court noted that the defendant did not offer himself for examination to prove his allegations and failed to prove that he was not aware of the adjourned date. As a result, the court dismissed the revision petition without costs.

The case highlights the importance of appearing in court on the adjourned date, as failure to do so can result in an ex parte decree being passed against the defendant. It also underscores the need for defendants to provide evidence to support their claims, as failure to do so can result in their case being dismissed.

In this particular case, the defendant argued that the adjournment of the case from the original date was illegal and outside the powers of the officer who ordered it.

This highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and obtaining authorization from the appropriate authorities.

The court also noted that the defendant did not offer himself for examination to prove his allegations and failed to prove that he was not aware of the adjourned date.
