Birendra Singh, the petitioner, has sought anticipatory bail in a wildlife protection case. The allegation against him is that he had one piece of ivory and cash in his rented accommodation, which was suspected to be from a male elephant found dead under suspicious circumstances in Betla National Park. The petitioner denies the allegations and claims that the ivory was ancestral property. 

The court has granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on the condition that he deposits Rs. 25,000 with the D.F.O, Tiger Project, Palamau and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties. The trial court will decide on the amount deposited by the petitioner at the conclusion of the trial. 

The case revolves around the illegal trade of ivory, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Act prohibits the trade of ivory and other wildlife products, and the possession of such items is also illegal. The petitioner's possession of ivory and cash has raised suspicion that he may have been involved in the illegal trade of ivory. 

The petitioner has denied any involvement in the illegal trade and has claimed that the ivory was ancestral property. However, the court has granted anticipatory bail on the condition that the petitioner deposits Rs. 25,000 with the D.F.O, Tiger Project, Palamau and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties. This condition has been imposed to ensure that the petitioner cooperates with the investigation and appears before the court when required. 

The court has also directed the trial court to decide on the amount deposited by the petitioner at the conclusion of the trial. This is to ensure that the petitioner is not unfairly penalized if he is found not guilty. The court has taken a balanced approach in granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner while also ensuring that the investigation is not hindered. 

The case highlights the need for strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws to prevent the illegal trade of wildlife products. The illegal trade of ivory has been a major concern for wildlife conservationists, as it has led to the decline in elephant populations. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and strict enforcement of the Act is necessary to ensure the survival of endangered species. 

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Birendra Singh in a wildlife protection case on the condition that he deposits Rs. 25,000 with the D.F.O, Tiger Project, Palamau and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties. The trial court will decide on the amount deposited by the petitioner at the conclusion of the trial. The case highlights the need for strict enforcement of wildlife protection laws to prevent the illegal trade of wildlife products.
