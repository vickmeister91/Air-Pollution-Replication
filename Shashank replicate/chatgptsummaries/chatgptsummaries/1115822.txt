The Madras High Court has recently allowed a civil revision petition filed by Aditya Masala and Nani Agro Foods, striking off the plaint in O.S. No. 53 of 2006 on the file of the Principal District Munsif, Erode. The respondent had filed a suit against the petitioner, alleging that their food processing industry was causing pollution, nuisance, and health hazards. The trial court had granted an ex-parte ad-interim injunction restraining the petitioner from running the industry and manufacturing masala powder. The High Court found that the trial court had clutched on to jurisdiction it did not have, causing irreparable injury to the petitioner. The court cited various judgments and held that the suit was not maintainable, and the order passed by the trial court was contrary to the provisions of the Air and Water Pollution Act.

The case in question pertains to a suit filed by the respondent against the petitioner, alleging that their food processing industry was causing pollution, nuisance, and health hazards. The trial court had granted an ex-parte ad-interim injunction restraining the petitioner from running the industry and manufacturing masala powder. The petitioner had then filed a civil revision petition before the Madras High Court, challenging the order passed by the trial court.

The Madras High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the trial court had clutched on to jurisdiction it did not have, causing irreparable injury to the petitioner. The court cited various judgments and held that the suit was not maintainable, and the order passed by the trial court was contrary to the provisions of the Air and Water Pollution Act.

The court observed that the respondent had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Air and Water Pollution Act, which requires the respondent to give a notice to the petitioner before filing a suit. The court also noted that the respondent had not produced any evidence to show that the petitioner's industry was causing pollution, nuisance, and health hazards. The court further observed that the respondent had not obtained any report from the Pollution Control Board before filing the suit.

The court held that the trial court had erred in granting an ex-parte ad-interim injunction without considering the merits of the case. The court also held that the trial court had failed to consider the fact that the petitioner's industry was providing employment to a large number of people and was contributing to the economy of the region.

The court cited various judgments, including the Supreme Court's decision in Virender Gaur v. State of Haryana, where it was held that the court should not grant an injunction unless it is satisfied that the plaintiff has a prima facie case and that the balance of convenience is in his favour. The court also cited the Supreme Court's decision in Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action v. Union of India, where it was held that the court should not grant an injunction unless it is satisfied that irreparable injury would be caused to the plaintiff.

The court held that the suit was not maintainable and that the order passed by the trial court was contrary to the provisions of the Air and Water Pollution Act. The court, therefore, allowed the civil revision petition filed by the petitioner and struck off the plaint in O.S. No. 53 of 2006 on the file of the Principal District Munsif, Erode.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in this case is significant as it reiterates the importance of following the procedure prescribed under the Air and Water Pollution Act before filing a suit. The court has also emphasized the need for the court to consider the merits of the case before granting an injunction. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on similar cases in the future.
