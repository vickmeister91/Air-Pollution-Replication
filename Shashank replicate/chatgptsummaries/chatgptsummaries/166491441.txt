The court order in question relates to a criminal case against Jeby John for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. Jeby John had filed an application for composition of the offences before the competent authority, which was subsequently rejected. Following this, Jeby John had filed an application to quash the criminal proceedings against him, which was dismissed by the court.

The court directed Jeby John to raise his defences before the Magistrate in the pending criminal case. This means that Jeby John will have to defend himself against the charges brought against him in the criminal case before the Magistrate. The court's decision to dismiss Jeby John's application to quash the criminal proceedings indicates that the court believes that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the case.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that is designed to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, as well as the destruction of their habitats. The Act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can be conserved and protected.

Jeby John's alleged offences under the Wild Life Protection Act are not specified in the court order. However, it can be assumed that the charges relate to the hunting, killing, or capturing of a wild animal, or the destruction of their habitat. These offences are considered to be serious, as they can have a significant impact on the environment and the ecosystem.

Jeby John's application for composition of the offences was rejected by the competent authority. Composition of offences is a process by which an accused person can pay a fine in lieu of facing trial for certain offences. The competent authority is responsible for deciding whether an application for composition of offences should be accepted or rejected.

The court's decision to dismiss Jeby John's application to quash the criminal proceedings means that he will have to face trial for the alleged offences. This is a significant development in the case, as it indicates that the court believes that there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the trial.

The court's direction to Jeby John to raise his defences before the Magistrate means that he will have to present his case before the Magistrate and argue why he should not be convicted of the alleged offences. This will require Jeby John to provide evidence and arguments in support of his case.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a criminal case against Jeby John for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act.
