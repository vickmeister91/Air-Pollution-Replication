Anil, who has been in jail since April 5, 2019, in connection with a case registered under the Indian Forest Act and Biological Diversity Act, filed a bail application which was granted by the court. The prosecution alleges that Anil stored 308 Kgs. Dhavda Gum and 18.504 Kgs. Salai Gum extracted from trees in the forest. However, Anil's counsel argues that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated.

The court, without commenting on the merits of the case, allowed Anil's bail application on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and a solvent surety of the same amount, and abides by the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. This section lays down the conditions for granting bail in non-bailable offences. The conditions include that the accused shall make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required, shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer, and shall not leave India without the previous permission of the court.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927, was enacted to consolidate the law relating to forests, the transit of forest-produce and the duty leviable on timber and other forest-produce. The Act provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002, was enacted to provide for the conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources.

The case against Anil pertains to the alleged storage of Dhavda Gum and Salai Gum extracted from trees in the forest. Dhavda Gum is a resin obtained from the tree Anogeissus latifolia, which is found in the dry deciduous forests of India. It is used in the manufacture of varnishes, paints, and adhesives. Salai Gum is a resin obtained from the tree Boswellia serrata, which is found in the dry hilly regions of India. It is used in the manufacture of incense sticks, perfumes, and medicines.

The extraction of these gums from trees in the forest is regulated under the Indian Forest Act and the Biological Diversity Act. The Act provides for the regulation of the transit of forest produce, the levy of duty on timber and other forest produce, and the conservation of forests. The Act also provides for the protection of wildlife and the prevention of offences against forests.

Anil's counsel argued that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. The court, however, did not comment on the merits of the case and granted bail to Anil on the conditions mentioned above. The court's decision to grant bail is based on the principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court has not yet made a decision on the guilt or innocence of Anil.

In conclusion, Anil's bail application was granted by the court on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and a solvent surety of the same amount, and abides by the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. The case against Anil pertains to the alleged storage of Dhavda Gum and Salai Gum extracted from trees in the forest, which is regulated under the Indian Forest Act and the Biological Diversity Act. Anil's counsel argued that he is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the case. The court, however, did not comment on the merits of the case and granted bail to Anil based on the principle that an accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
