In a recent court order, the petitioner, Kamla, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, which refused to release her tractor and trolley bearing Registration No. RJ 34 RB 0649. The tractor and trolley were seized as case property in FIR No. 02/2018 registered at Police Station Mandrayal, Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50 and 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The petitioner shall keep the vehicle and trolley so released intact and shall not change their identification. The petitioner shall produce the vehicle and trolley as and when the trial court requires the same for proposed identification of the case property. The petitioner shall execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court is empowered to impose any or other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit.

This order is significant as it highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with seized property. The court recognized the petitioner's right to have her property released, but also imposed conditions to ensure that the property is not tampered with and can be used as evidence in the ongoing case.

It is important to note that the offences for which the tractor and trolley were seized are serious in nature and involve the protection of wildlife. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that aims to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and penalties for offences related to wildlife.

In this case, the tractor and trolley were seized as case property in connection with offences under Sections 29, 50 and 51 of the Act.

Section 51 deals with the power of the court to cancel any license or permit granted under the Act.

The court's order to release the tractor and trolley as case property is a positive step towards ensuring that legal procedures are followed in cases involving seized property. It is important for law enforcement agencies to follow proper procedures when seizing property, and for courts to ensure that the rights of the accused are protected.
