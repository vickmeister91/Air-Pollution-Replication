The Karnataka High Court has issued an order to quash a closure notice that was previously issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board against M/S Veerabhadreshwara Stone Crusher, a stone crushing unit. The court has also directed the respondents to allow the operation of the petitioner's crushing unit at the current site until its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court cited a similar case in which the closure notice was quashed and a writ of mandamus was issued to permit the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity until its application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. This decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had already applied for a license to operate the crushing unit at a safer location, and that the closure notice was issued before the application was even considered.

The court also noted that the petitioner had taken all necessary precautions to ensure that the stone crushing activity did not cause any harm to the environment or public health. The petitioner had installed dust suppression systems and had taken measures to prevent the emission of harmful pollutants.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should not be punished without being given a fair opportunity to be heard. The court found that the closure notice was issued without giving the petitioner a chance to present its case, and that it was therefore arbitrary and illegal.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court has issued an order to quash a closure notice that was previously issued against M/S Veerabhadreshwara Stone Crusher. The court has directed the respondents to allow the operation of the petitioner's crushing unit at the current site until its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice and the fact that the petitioner had taken all necessary precautions to ensure that the stone crushing activity did not cause any harm to the environment or public health.
