The Madras Aluminium Company had filed a writ petition seeking permission to enter into a leased area of 960 acres in Kodaikanal to carry out mining operations of Bauxite. The lease had expired in 2001, and the company had abandoned its mining operations. However, the Forest (Conservation) Act imposes restrictions on the use of forest land for non-forestry purposes, and the court could not issue a positive mandamus to permit the company to enter the land for mining operations. The court dismissed the writ petition and the writ appeal.

The Madras Aluminium Company had leased the land in Kodaikanal for mining operations of Bauxite. However, the lease had expired in 2001, and the company had abandoned its mining operations. The company filed a writ petition seeking permission to enter the leased area to carry out mining operations.

The court could not issue a positive mandamus to permit the company to enter the land for mining operations.

The court dismissed the writ petition and the writ appeal. The court observed that the company could make a representation to the authorities concerned for removing the mined Bauxite. The court did not provide any further details on how the company could make a representation or what the authorities concerned were. The court's decision was based on the Forest (Conservation) Act, which imposes restrictions on the use of forest land for non-forestry purposes.

The act requires prior approval from the central government for the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The act also requires the compensatory afforestation of an equivalent area of non-forest land for the forest land diverted. The act aims to protect the country's forests and wildlife and maintain ecological balance.
