The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has recently upheld the order of a Chief Judicial Magistrate directing a witness to give her voice sample in a case of alleged sexual abuse of children at an orphanage. The witness had refused to give her voice sample, claiming that there is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for compelling a person to do so. However, the court held that collecting voice samples is a part of the investigation process and is necessary to arrive at the truth. The court also cited a previous judgment that an accused cannot claim any right or privilege and refuse to give his/her voice sample.

The court order discusses the power of a criminal court to use incidental/implied powers to arrive at the truth. The court cites previous cases to support the idea that a court possesses all necessary powers to make its orders effective. The court also discusses the power of a criminal court to subject a witness to DNA analysis, tracing the source of this power to Section 91 and the second limb of Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 45 of the Indian Evidence Act. The court dismisses a Criminal Revision Case and orders a witness to give her voice sample in a human trafficking case being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
