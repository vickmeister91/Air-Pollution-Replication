The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by R. Muralidharan challenging the constitutionality of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The petitioner argued that the Act violates Article 14 and India's obligation under the Paris Convention on Biological Diversity. The court rejected the petition, stating that the Act was enacted to provide for conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components, and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the use of biological resources. The court also noted that the Act had been in force for twelve years and that any difficulties in implementation could be addressed by the National Green Tribunal. The court dismissed the petition as misconceived.

The Act also provides for the establishment of a National Biodiversity Authority and State Biodiversity Boards to implement the provisions of the Act.
