The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a case in which Kamal Kishore and others were accused of violating the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The complaint alleged that the accused company, M/s Maihar Cement, was producing cement and generating particulate matters that caused air pollution. The company did not comply with the conditions imposed on it, and the officers of the Board informed them about fugitive emissions exceeding the limits. 

Two of the applicants did not want to press the petition, and the remaining applicant challenged the impugned order. The court found that the impugned order was not bad in law and could not be assailed on the grounds of lack of recording of reasons or the report of the analyst being untrustworthy. The court also found that the complaint had specific averments about the accused persons' responsibility for the day-to-day business of the company or being in charge of the company at the time of the alleged offence, as required under section 40 of the Act.

The court order discusses section 40 of the Act, which states that if a company commits an offense, the person directly in charge of the company's business at the time of the offense is deemed guilty. The court also notes that if the offense was committed with the consent or neglect of a director or officer of the company, they too can be held liable. The court cites a case where a manager was held vicariously liable for an offense committed by the company, but the directors were not found to be liable. 

The court also discusses the importance of preventing pollution and ensuring public health, and concludes that the specific averments in the complaint against the applicant, who was the President of the company at the time of the offense, are sufficient to prosecute him for violating the provisions of the Act. The court states that instructions and warnings have been given to prevent and control air pollution, and specific conditions and norms have been communicated to a company seeking permission to extend production capacity. The President and other higher officers of the company cannot plead ignorance of these norms and laws regarding pollution control. 

The court finds sufficient grounds to issue a process to prosecute the applicants for violating the Act. The petition is dismissed, and the interim order for stay of proceedings is vacated. The trial court is informed of this order.
