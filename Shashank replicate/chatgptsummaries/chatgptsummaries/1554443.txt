The court order pertains to a civil miscellaneous appeal filed by M/S Meenakshisundaram Textiles against M/S Valliammal Textiles Ltd. The appeal challenges an ex parte judgment and decree passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court No.V, Coimbatore at Tiruppur, which ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff a sum of Rs.1,12,25,770.00 with future interest. The appeal questions whether the judgment and decree can be considered valid under Section 2(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it does not contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.

The court cites various judgments to emphasize the importance of a judgment containing a brief summary of the facts, the evidence produced, and the reasoning of the judge for either decreeing the suit or dismissing it. The court notes that a judgment is the final outcome of a case and must be based on the evidence and arguments presented before the court. The court further states that a judgment must contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision. The court concludes that a judgment that does not contain the bare minimum facts, the point for determination, the evidence adduced, and the application of those facts and evidence for deciding the issue would not qualify it to be called a "judgment."

The court order also discusses the requirements for an ex parte judgment and decree, which are judgments and decrees made in the absence of the defendant. The court emphasizes that even in an ex parte case, the court must carefully consider the pleadings and evidence before making a decision. The court notes that a judgment and decree made ex parte are appealable and executable, and must contain a minimum level of consideration of the case.

In the present case, the court finds that the judgment and decree passed by the trial court does not meet the requirements of a valid judgment. The court notes that the judgment and decree does not contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision. The court further notes that the judgment and decree does not contain a brief summary of the facts, the evidence produced, and the reasoning of the judge for either decreeing the suit or dismissing it.

The court ultimately sets aside the judgment and decree in question and orders the trial judge to complete the recording of evidence and pronounce a new judgment within a specified timeframe. The court notes that the trial judge must ensure that the new judgment contains a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision. The court further notes that the new judgment must contain a brief summary of the facts, the evidence produced, and the reasoning of the judge for either decreeing the suit or dismissing it.

The court's order highlights the importance of a valid judgment and the requirements that must be met for a judgment to be considered valid. The court notes that a judgment is the final outcome of a case and must be based on the evidence and arguments presented before the court. The court emphasizes that even in an ex parte case, the court must carefully consider the pleadings and evidence before making a decision. The court's order serves as a reminder to trial courts to ensure that their judgments meet the requirements of a valid judgment and contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision.
