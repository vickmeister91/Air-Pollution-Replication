In the first case, the court was asked to consider whether the allocation of land to Bharat Petroleum Corporation for a petrol pump in Sector 21-C, Chandigarh was illegal. The petitioners claimed that the land had been given away at a low rate, causing financial loss to the public, and that the installation of the new petrol pump would cause pollution and create a public hazard. The respondents argued that the allocation was made in the public interest and that the new facility would be eco-friendly. After hearing both sides, the court found that the allocation was legal and dismissed the petition.

The second case involved a petition to prevent the setting up of a facility, which the court also dismissed. The court stated that the facility would not promote public interest and that the suggestion that the petition was driven by private interests was not entirely unfounded. The interim order passed earlier was also vacated. The respondents could have been compensated with costs, but the court refrained from doing so, hoping that the petitioners would take up a better cause in the future.

They claimed that the land had been given away at a low rate, causing financial loss to the public. They also argued that the installation of the new petrol pump would cause pollution and create a public hazard. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the allocation was made in the public interest and that the new facility would be eco-friendly.

After hearing both sides, the court found that the allocation was legal and dismissed the petition. The court noted that the allocation was made after following due process and that there was no evidence to suggest that the allocation was made for any improper purpose. The court also noted that the installation of the new petrol pump would not cause any significant pollution or create a public hazard. The court observed that the respondents had taken adequate measures to ensure that the facility would be eco-friendly.

In the second case, the court dismissed a petition to prevent the setting up of a facility. The court stated that the facility would not promote public interest and that the suggestion that the petition was driven by private interests was not entirely unfounded. The interim order passed earlier was also vacated. The respondents could have been compensated with costs, but the court refrained from doing so, hoping that the petitioners would take up a better cause in the future.

The court observed that the petitioners had failed to establish that the facility would cause any harm to the public or the environment. The court also noted that the respondents had obtained all the necessary approvals and had taken adequate measures to ensure that the facility would be safe and environmentally friendly. The court stated that the petitioners had not shown any valid reason to prevent the setting up of the facility.

In both cases, the court carefully considered the arguments presented by both sides and made its decision based on the evidence presented. The court's decisions were based on the principles of law and justice and were aimed at promoting the public interest. The court's decisions also demonstrated the importance of following due process and obtaining all the necessary approvals before undertaking any development activities.
