The court order pertains to a dispute between Wipro Limited and the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board regarding the supply of electricity to the company's building. The petitioner had applied for 4000 KVA power supply on 13.09.2007 and paid a sum of Rs. 64,00,500/- towards the registration charges and EMD charges. The Superintendent Engineer issued an available notice for a period of 3 months, on the condition that the petitioner company produce a completion certificate from CMDA. It was clearly mentioned in the letter that if the certificate was not produced the amount paid by the petitioner would be forfeited. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to quash a letter dated 10.09.2008 and to direct the respondents to refund the sum of Rs.87,72,414/- together with interest, which was paid on 17.09.2008.

The court reserved its order on 07.09.2018 and pronounced it on 15.03.2019. The court order does not provide a resolution to the dispute. The Electricity Board had issued two availability notices to the company, directing them to produce a completion certificate from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority within a stipulated time limit, failing which monthly minimum charges would be levied and the application would be cancelled. The company had requested the Electricity Board to provide electricity without insisting on the completion certificate, but the Board had refused.

The petitioner had previously paid a monthly charge to avoid forfeiture charges and had approached the High Court for electricity supply without a completion certificate. The High Court had allowed the writ petition, directing the respondents to provide electricity without insisting on the completion certificate. However, the Electricity Board argues that they cannot supply electricity until the completion certificate is given and that the monthly minimum charges must be paid once the cables are laid. The Board complied with the order of the Learned Single Judge but argues that it is contrary to the order of the Division Bench.

The court order discusses a circular memo issued by the Electricity Board regarding the requirement of planning permits and compliance certificates for multi-storied and special buildings when applying for electricity service connections. The court also addresses the issue of minimum monthly charges and the obligation of the Electricity Board to supply electricity only when all necessary formalities and requirements are completed, including obtaining a completion certificate. The court upholds the Division Bench's judgment that electricity can only be supplied when a completion certificate is given and that the petitioner is liable to pay monthly minimum charges. The circular memo is deemed valid and binding, and the Electricity Board is duty-bound to comply with the Division Bench's order.

The court order states that the Electricity Ombudsman has the power to overturn a circular issued by the electricity board. The board is required to follow its own circular and the Division Bench was correct in requiring a completion certificate. The monthly minimum charges must be paid by the consumer regardless of electricity consumption, and the board can levy these charges once it is able to supply electricity. The writ petition is dismissed and there will be no costs. The order is addressed to the Superintendent Engineer and Executive Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board.
