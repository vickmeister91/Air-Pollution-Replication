The court order pertains to two separate cases where the accused-petitioners have been charged with offences under Sections 498A and 406 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). In the first case, the petitioner, Daljeet Singh Saluja, had filed a petition seeking to quash and set aside an order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate No.18, Jaipur Metropolitan, Jaipur, whereby he proceeded to frame charges against the accused-petitioner. The petitioner's counsel contended that the trial court did not have territorial jurisdiction and thus, the order passed by it was illegal. However, the court rejected this plea and held that specific allegations had been made in the complaint that on various occasions, the in-laws of the complainant came to her parental house at Jaipur and demanded money. The court also rejected the petitioner's plea that the allegation of giving Rs.10 lakhs in cash to the accused was not sustainable in the absence of proof as to where this huge amount of money flowed to the parents of the complainant.

In the second case, the accused-husband had been charged with offences under Sections 498A and 406 IPC. The court rejected the plea of the accused to examine the source of income of the complainant's parents at the stage of framing of charges. The court held that the evidence available on record gave rise to grave suspicion against the accused and that the trial court had rightly proceeded to frame charges against him. The court dismissed the criminal misc. petition filed by the accused.

Section 498A of the IPC deals with cruelty by a husband or his relatives towards a woman. It states that whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine. Section 406 of the IPC deals with criminal breach of trust. It states that whoever commits criminal breach of trust shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In both cases, the accused-petitioners had challenged the framing of charges against them by the trial court. They had contended that the allegations made against them were false and that the trial court did not have the jurisdiction to proceed with the case. However, the court rejected their pleas and held that there was sufficient evidence on record to frame charges against them.

In the first case, the court held that the trial court had the jurisdiction to proceed with the case as specific allegations had been made in the complaint that the in-laws of the complainant had come to her parental house at Jaipur and demanded money. The court also held that the allegation of giving Rs.10 lakhs in cash to the accused was not sustainable in the absence of proof as to where this huge amount of money flowed to the parents of the complainant.

In the second case, the court held that the trial court had rightly proceeded to frame charges against the accused-husband as the evidence available on record gave rise to grave suspicion against him. The court also rejected the accused's plea to examine the source of income of the complainant's parents at the stage of framing of charges.

The court's orders in both cases highlight the importance of evidence in criminal cases. The court has held that there was sufficient evidence on record to frame charges against the accused-petitioners and that the trial court had the jurisdiction to proceed with the cases. The court has also rejected the accused's pleas to examine the source of income of the complainant's parents and to quash the charges against them.

In conclusion, the court's orders in both cases emphasize the need for a thorough investigation and collection of evidence in criminal cases. The court has held that the trial court has the jurisdiction to proceed with the cases if there is sufficient evidence on record to frame charges against the accused. The court has also emphasized that the accused cannot escape punishment by challenging the jurisdiction of the trial court or by questioning the source of income of the complainant's parents.
