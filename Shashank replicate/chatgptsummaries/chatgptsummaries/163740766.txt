The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently disposed of two petitions seeking the quashing of a complaint and summoning order under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint was filed by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Unitech Limited and others for violating the notification on Environment Impact Assessment of Development Projects. The accused had started construction without obtaining prior Environment Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, which was a continuous offense until the clearance was obtained. The court heard arguments from both sides and disposed of the petitions.

The court order states that the accused persons in charge of a construction project have criminally conspired to carry out the project in violation of environmental regulations and without obtaining necessary clearance. The court has allowed petitions to be filed against the accused and has stated that the continuation of criminal proceedings against the accused would be an abuse of process of law. The court has also cited a previous case to caution that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised sparingly and with circumspection.

The court order quashes the proceedings against M/s Unitech Limited and others under Section 15 of the Act and summoning order dated 31.7.2009. The order was issued on July 10, 2013.
