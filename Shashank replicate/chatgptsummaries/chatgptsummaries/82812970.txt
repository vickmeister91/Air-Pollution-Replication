The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Harvinder Singh and his wife Sonal Duggal to quash a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board under the Environment Protection Act. The court stated that the points raised in the petition had already been considered and rejected in a previous case, and therefore the present petition had no merit.

The case revolved around a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against Harvinder Singh and Sonal Duggal for allegedly violating the Environment Protection Act. The couple had set up a factory without obtaining the necessary clearances from the pollution control board. The board had issued a show-cause notice to the couple, asking them to explain why action should not be taken against them for violating the act.

In response, Harvinder Singh and Sonal Duggal had filed a petition in the court, seeking to quash the complaint filed by the pollution control board. They argued that the board had no jurisdiction to issue the show-cause notice, as the factory was not causing any pollution. They also contended that the board had not followed the due process of law while issuing the notice.

However, the court rejected these arguments, stating that they had already been considered and rejected in a previous case. The court noted that in the previous case, it had been established that the pollution control board had the jurisdiction to issue the show-cause notice, and that the due process of law had been followed. The court also observed that the couple had not obtained the necessary clearances from the pollution control board before setting up the factory, and therefore they were in violation of the Environment Protection Act.

The court further stated that the present petition had no merit, as it was based on the same arguments that had already been rejected in the previous case. The court noted that the couple had not presented any new evidence or arguments to support their case. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition and allowed the pollution control board to proceed with its complaint against the couple.

This case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary clearances and following the due process of law while setting up a factory or any other industrial unit. It also underscores the role of the pollution control board in ensuring that the environment is protected from the harmful effects of industrial activities. The court's decision in this case reaffirms the authority of the pollution control board to take action against those who violate the Environment Protection Act, and sends a strong message to others who may be tempted to flout the law.
