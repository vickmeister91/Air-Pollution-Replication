The Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 provides for the regulation of rents and eviction of tenants in Delhi. Section 14(1)(a) of the Act allows a landlord to apply for eviction of a tenant on the grounds of non-payment of rent. In a recent court order, the petitioner had filed an application for eviction of his nephew, the respondent, under this section of the Act. The petitioner claimed that the respondent had not paid rent for the premises and had also filed a suit for perpetual injunction against the petitioner.

The respondent, on the other hand, denied the allegations and claimed that the petitioner was not the owner of the property. The court found that the petitioner had failed to prove ownership of the property and the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. Therefore, the petition was dismissed.

The court order was announced on May 4th, 2018 by the Additional Rent Controller-02 at the Central/Tis Hazari Courts in a case between Shiv Kumar Sharma and Kalikant Jha.
