The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case brought by Air Liquide India Holding Private against the State of Gujarat and three others. The petitioner challenged an order passed by respondent No.2 and sought to restrain the respondents from raising demand for electricity duty until 24.11.2014 and to direct the respondents to refund the total amount of electricity paid by the petitioners for the period which is available to the petitioners by way of exemption from payment of electricity duty in respect of consumption of energy. The petitioner claimed that it established its own industrial unit in 2009 and was registered as a medium-scale industry after appropriate sanction granted by the ministry of industry and commerce, New Delhi.

The court order pertains to a dispute between the petitioner and the respondents over the petitioner's claim for exemption from payment of electricity duty for its industrial unit at Jhagadia. The petitioner claimed that its unit was a "New Industrial Undertaking" and therefore eligible for exemption from payment of duty for the first five years from the date of commercial production. The respondents, however, argued that the petitioner's unit did not fulfill the requirements and criteria prescribed by the Act to be considered a new industrial undertaking. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered the material on record before making a decision.

The court order discusses the eligibility of an industrial unit for exemption from electricity duty under Section 3(2)(vii) of the Act. The petitioner claims that their unit is a new industrial undertaking and therefore eligible for exemption. However, the court examines whether the unit falls under any of the exclusions listed in the Act, such as if it is an expansion of an existing business or if it was formed by splitting or reconstruction of an existing business. The court also considers whether the unit is a consumer of first instance and concludes that this is a secondary aspect to the determination of whether the unit is a new industrial undertaking. The court ultimately determines that the petitioner's unit does not qualify as a new industrial undertaking and is therefore not eligible for exemption from electricity duty.

The court order discusses the definition of a "new industrial undertaking" and the conditions that must be met to qualify for exemption from payment of electricity duty. The court emphasizes that the primary business and field of operation must be different from the existing business, and there must be a physically separate industrial unit that can exist on its own as a viable unit. The court cites a previous decision by the Hon'ble Apex Court to support its argument.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a unit set up for "expansion of business" is excluded from the definition of a "new industrial undertaking." The court notes that in a previous case, the Supreme Court did not consider a unit as a "new undertaking" because certain assets were used in the manufacturing activity at the new unit. The court also examines whether the petitioner's unit at Jhagadia is a physically separate and identifiable undertaking separate from the existing business. The court finds that there is not enough evidence to determine whether the plant or machinery used previously for executing contracts with clients was used in setting up the unit at Jhagadia.

The court order discusses the issue of ownership and transfer of plant and machinery used for industrial purposes. The petitioner claims to have installed new technology at a new industrial unit, but it is unclear whether the plant and machinery used were previously used for industrial purposes or not. The court notes that relevant documents and material need to be examined to determine this. The court also mentions the petitioner's reply and application related to the list of machinery and capital investment. The issue of ownership and transfer of plant and machinery is important in determining whether the petitioner qualifies for exemption from payment of electricity duty.

The court order grants the petitioner registration as a manufacturer of industrial gases under the Central Excise Act, as well as registration under the Gujarat Value Added Act and Central Sales Tax Act. Approval from the Weights and Measurement department for flow meters and weight bridges is also granted. The petitioner claims to be a "New Industrial Undertaking" and sought exemption from payment of electricity duty, but their application was rejected by the authorities. The respondents claim that the petitioner is not eligible for the exemption and that the impugned order was passed correctly. The electricity company does not dispute the petitioner's claim that they have paid the total amount as per the claim raised by the respondents. The petitioner argues that the duty can only be levied and claimed from them after they started consuming electricity in 2009, and not prior to that.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether a petitioner's industrial unit qualifies as a "new industrial undertaking" and is therefore eligible for exemption from payment of duty and electricity fees. The court examines the relevant provisions of the law and ultimately concludes that the petitioner's unit does qualify as a new industrial undertaking and is entitled to the requested exemptions.

The court order discusses the exemption from payment of electricity duty for industrial undertakings. The exemption is available for a period of five years for new industrial undertakings engaged in the production of goods. However, certain conditions must be fulfilled, including obtaining a certificate of eligibility for the exemption within a prescribed time limit. The court also considers the ownership of the plants and the purpose of the electricity consumption in determining eligibility for the exemption.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioner claimed to have purchased new plant and machinery for setting up a unit, but there was no discussion or finding regarding whether the machinery was previously used in India for any industrial purpose
