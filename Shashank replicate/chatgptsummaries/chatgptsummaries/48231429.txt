In a recent court order, Kadhe Ram was granted bail in a case related to the Wild Life Protection Act. The court noted that there was no recovery of a firearm from the applicant and no independent witness of the alleged recovery. Based on this, the court deemed it appropriate to grant bail to Kadhe Ram.

However, the court imposed several conditions on the bail. Firstly, the applicant was not to tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses. This condition was put in place to ensure that the trial process was not compromised in any way. Secondly, the applicant was required to remain present before the trial court on each date fixed. This condition was put in place to ensure that the trial process was not delayed in any way.

The court's decision to grant bail to Kadhe Ram was based on the lack of evidence against him. The court noted that there was no recovery of a firearm from the applicant and no independent witness of the alleged recovery. This lack of evidence made it difficult for the court to justify keeping Kadhe Ram in custody.

The court's decision to impose conditions on the bail was also based on the need to ensure that the trial process was not compromised in any way. The conditions were put in place to ensure that the applicant did not tamper with evidence or intimidate witnesses, and that the trial process was not delayed in any way.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Kadhe Ram was based on the lack of evidence against him. The court noted that there was no recovery of a firearm from the applicant and no independent witness of the alleged recovery. This lack of evidence made it difficult for the court to justify keeping Kadhe Ram in custody. However, the court also recognized the need to ensure that the trial process was not compromised in any way, and therefore imposed several conditions on the bail.
