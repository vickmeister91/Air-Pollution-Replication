The court order in question pertains to a challenge made by the Branch Manager of Muthoot Mercantile Limited, Kunnamangalam Branch, against a notice issued by the Circle Inspector of Police, Chevayur Police Station, Kozhikode. The notice required the manager to produce gold ornaments pledged in his concern with relevant receipts for investigation of a crime registered at Kunnamangalam Police Station. The manager argued that he cannot be compelled to produce the gold ornaments or records relating to them as pledges were made by third parties without their consent.

The court dismissed the challenge, stating that the notice was issued under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further held that Section 131 of the Evidence Act does not apply at the stage of investigation. This means that the manager cannot refuse to produce the gold ornaments or records relating to them on the grounds that they were pledged by third parties without their consent.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a court or an officer in charge of a police station to issue a notice to any person who is in possession of any document or thing which is necessary for the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under the Code. The notice requires the person to produce the document or thing before the court or the officer issuing the notice.

Section 131 of the Evidence Act, on the other hand, deals with the privilege of a witness against self-incrimination. It provides that no one is bound to answer any question if the answer would expose him to a criminal charge or penalty or forfeiture of property. However, this privilege is not available at the stage of investigation.

In this case, the court held that the notice issued by the Circle Inspector of Police was validly issued under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further held that the manager cannot refuse to produce the gold ornaments or records relating to them on the grounds that they were pledged by third parties without their consent. The court reasoned that the manager is in possession of the gold ornaments and records relating to them, and therefore, he is required to produce them under the notice issued by the Circle Inspector of Police.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the privilege against self-incrimination under Section 131 of the Evidence Act. The court's decision also highlights the importance of complying with notices issued under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as failure to do so can result in serious consequences.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case upholds the validity of the notice issued by the Circle Inspector of Police under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court's decision also clarifies that the privilege against self-incrimination under Section 131 of the Evidence Act is not available at the stage of investigation. The decision underscores the importance of complying with notices issued under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as failure to do so can result in serious consequences.
