The Karnataka High Court recently heard multiple writ petitions filed by various companies located in the Peenya Industrial Area of Bengaluru against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The petitions sought to quash orders and demand notices issued by the Board, imposing interim environment compensation on the companies. The KSPCB had directed the companies to pay interim environment compensation ranging from Rs. 25 lakhs to Rs. 1 crore within 15 days. The court order pertains to five separate writ petitions filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.

During the hearing, the court heard arguments from both the petitioners and the respondents and will make a decision on the matter. The court order lists the names and addresses of the petitioners and respondents, along with the names of their advocates. The petitioners argued that the KSPCB had not provided any statutory provision or direction from the National Green Tribunal to justify the demands. They also contended that the KSPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while issuing the demand notices.

The KSPCB, on the other hand, argued that the companies had violated environmental laws and had caused damage to the environment. Therefore, the KSPCB had the power to impose interim environment compensation on the companies. The KSPCB also argued that the companies had not challenged the validity of the relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, under which the demand notices were issued.

After hearing the arguments, the court found that the KSPCB had not provided any statutory provision or direction from the National Green Tribunal to justify the demands. The court also noted that the KSPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while issuing the demand notices. Therefore, the court set aside the demands but clarified that if the companies had violated environmental laws, the KSPCB could take action in accordance with the law.

The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by companies challenging notices issued by the KSPCB demanding interim environmental compensation or environmental compensation charges. The writ petitions were disposed of on the terms mentioned above.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court has set aside the demand notices issued by the KSPCB to various companies located in the Peenya Industrial Area of Bengaluru. The court found that the KSPCB had not provided any statutory provision or direction from the National Green Tribunal to justify the demands. However, the court clarified that if the companies had violated environmental laws, the KSPCB could take action in accordance with the law.
