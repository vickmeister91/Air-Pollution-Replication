The Gujarat High Court recently heard a Criminal Revision Application that challenged the legality of an order passed by a learned Magistrate rejecting an application under Section 33 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The complainant, an Assistant Law Officer in the Regional Office of Gujarat Pollution Control Board, had filed a complaint against the accused for contravening the provisions of Sections 24, 25, and 26 of the Act. The complainant had also sought an interim injunction restraining the accused from discharging polluted water from the factory. The Court examined the relevant provisions of the Act and heard arguments from both parties before making a decision.

The court order discusses the procedure for obtaining a sanction from the State Board before discharging sewage or trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer, or land. The State Board can grant or refuse consent and impose conditions. If someone discharges polluted water without obtaining consent, it is punishable under the Act. The court also discusses the special provisions of Section 33 of the Act, which gives special rights, remedies, and powers to the court to prevent pollution.

The court examined the provisions of the Act and found that the accused had contravened the provisions of Sections 24, 25, and 26 of the Act. The court also found that the accused had been discharging polluted water from the factory without obtaining consent from the State Board. The court noted that the complainant had sought an interim injunction restraining the accused from discharging polluted water from the factory, but the learned Magistrate had rejected the application.

The court set aside the order of the learned Magistrate who rejected the complainant's application under Section 33 and directed the accused to desist from discharging trade effluent and remove any already discharged matter within two months. The court also directed the accused to obtain consent from the State Board before discharging any trade effluent in the future. The court noted that the accused had not obtained consent from the State Board before discharging trade effluent from the factory, which was a violation of the Act.

The court also ordered the accused, who owns Binni Prints in Navagadh GIDC, Jetpur, to stop discharging trade effluent from their factory onto land outside the factory. They must also remove and dispose of any effluent that has already been discharged within two months. The court directed the JMFC Jetpur to expedite the trial of the case within three months and send a compliance report to the court. The rule is made absolute to the extent mentioned.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court has set an important precedent in the case of Binni Prints in Navagadh GIDC, Jetpur. The court has made it clear that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, must be followed, and that those who violate the Act will be held accountable. The court has also shown that it is willing to use its special powers under Section 33 of the Act to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The court's decision is a victory for the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and for all those who care about the environment.
