The court order in question pertains to a criminal case involving R. Renganathan as the accused and T.R. Chandrasekaran as the complainant. The complainant had filed a complaint against the accused for an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act). The accused had challenged the order passed in Cr.M.P.No.9973 of 2012, which had allowed the application filed under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to send for the document from the bank. The court dismissed the petition and upheld the findings of the lower courts.

The case revolves around a cheque that was allegedly issued by the accused to the complainant. The complainant claimed that the cheque was dishonored by the bank due to insufficient funds. As a result, the complainant filed a complaint against the accused under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, which deals with the dishonor of cheques.

During the course of the trial, the complainant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to send for the document from the bank. This application was allowed by the lower courts, which prompted the accused to challenge the order in the higher court. The accused argued that the lower courts had erred in allowing the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. as the complainant had failed to establish a prima facie case against him.

However, the court dismissed the petition and upheld the findings of the lower courts. The court observed that the complainant had made out a prima facie case against the accused and that the documents sought to be summoned were relevant to the case. The court also noted that the accused had failed to produce any evidence to rebut the complainant's case.

The court further held that the complainant must be given an opportunity to prove that the cheque had been issued to him. The court noted that the complainant had produced a copy of the cheque and that the bank had also confirmed that the cheque had been dishonored due to insufficient funds. The court observed that these facts prima facie established the complainant's case and that the accused must be given an opportunity to rebut the same.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal case involving the dishonor of a cheque.
