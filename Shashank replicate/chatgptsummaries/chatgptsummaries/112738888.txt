In the first court order, the plaintiff filed a suit against the defendant for illegally impounding his commercial vehicle. The plaintiff argued that only a person who is a member of an inter-departmental team headed by an SDM is empowered to impound vehicles under the Motor Vehicle Act. The defendants contested the suit, claiming that the driver of the plaintiff's bus was challaned for violating the Supreme Court's directions and did not comply with the directions to report to the police station. The defendants also claimed that the directions given by the Supreme Court did not take away the powers of the police given under the Motor Vehicle Act.

The court had to determine whether the impounding of the plaintiff's vehicle was legal or not. The plaintiff argued that the impounding was illegal because it was done by someone who was not authorized to do so under the Motor Vehicle Act. The defendants argued that the impounding was legal because the driver of the plaintiff's bus had violated the Supreme Court's directions.

Therefore, the impounding of the plaintiff's vehicle was illegal.

However, the court held that the State was a necessary party and should have been impleaded by the plaintiff. The court also struck out an issue related to the maintainability of the suit under Section 41(d) of the Specific Relief Act as it was not applicable to the facts of the case.
