The court order pertains to two separate cases involving compensation for the death of a person due to electrocution. In the first case, a writ petition seeking compensation was dismissed by a learned single judge who stated that the appropriate remedy in such cases is a regular suit and that the writ jurisdiction is only for the enforcement of a right and not for the establishment of a right. However, the court appointed an arbitrator to determine the compensation payable, and the arbitrator awarded a compensation of Rs. 3,99,000/- with 12% per annum from the date of the filing of the writ petition till realization. The appellants have now appealed to the court to pass an order in terms of the award passed by the arbitrator.

In the second case, a person died due to electrocution caused by a snapped overhead electric line maintained by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The Electricity Board argued that the accident was due to a natural calamity and that there were no eyewitnesses to establish the cause of the accident. However, the court found that the evidence provided by the eyewitness was credible and that the Electricity Board was negligent in maintaining the electric system. The court awarded compensation to the deceased's family and confirmed the decision of the arbitrator. The court also ordered the Electricity Board to pay the arbitrator's fees.

Electrocution cases are not uncommon in India, and compensation for such cases is often a matter of dispute. In the first case, the learned single judge had dismissed the writ petition seeking compensation, stating that the appropriate remedy in such cases is a regular suit and that the writ jurisdiction is only for the enforcement of a right and not for the establishment of a right. However, the court appointed an arbitrator to determine the compensation payable, which shows that there is some flexibility in the legal system to provide compensation in such cases.

The arbitrator in the first case awarded a compensation of Rs. 3,99,000/- with 12% per annum from the date of the filing of the writ petition till realization. The appellants have now appealed to the court to pass an order in terms of the award passed by the arbitrator. It remains to be seen whether the court will accept the award passed by the arbitrator or whether it will modify the award in any way.

In the second case, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board argued that the accident was due to a natural calamity and that there were no eyewitnesses to establish the cause of the accident. However, the court found that the evidence provided by the eyewitness was credible and that the Electricity Board was negligent in maintaining the electric system. The court awarded compensation to the deceased's family and confirmed the decision of the arbitrator. The court also ordered the Electricity Board to pay the arbitrator's fees.

The court's decision in the second case is significant as it holds the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board responsible for the death of the person due to its negligence in maintaining the electric system. This decision may serve as a deterrent to other electricity boards and companies to ensure that their electric systems are properly maintained to avoid such accidents.

In conclusion, the court orders in these two cases highlight the importance of providing compensation for deaths due to electrocution. The legal system in India provides some flexibility in providing compensation in such cases, as seen in the appointment of an arbitrator in the first case. The court's decision in the second case holds the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board responsible for the death of the person due to its negligence in maintaining the electric system, which may serve as a deterrent to other electricity boards and companies. Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder to companies and authorities to ensure that their electric systems are properly maintained to avoid such accidents and to provide compensation in case of any mishap.
