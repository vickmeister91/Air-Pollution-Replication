The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the termination of Aanganwadi workers without following proper procedure. In the first order, Smt. Anita filed a writ petition challenging her termination and claimed that her services were terminated without following proper procedure. The court found that the petitioner had been terminated without conducting an enquiry and without giving her a show cause notice. The court also noted that the termination order was identical to those passed in other cases and that the state government had issued a policy for the appointment and termination of Aanganwadi workers. The court quashed the termination order and ordered that the petitioner be given all consequential benefits.

In the second order, the court found that the employer violated the principles of natural justice and fair play by not providing notice or conducting an enquiry with the participation of the petitioner. The court explains the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings and quotes extensively from the case of Uma Nath Pandey v. State of U.P. to explain the principles of natural justice. The court emphasizes that justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done.

The third order discusses the importance of natural justice, which has evolved over time and is not always explicitly stated in statutes or rules. The two basic principles of natural justice are "nemo judex in causa sua" (no one should be a judge in their own case) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The court emphasizes that following these principles is essential to prevent miscarriage of justice and ensure equality and fairness. The court quashes an order terminating the petitioner's employment, as the prescribed procedure was not followed, and orders the petitioner to be entitled to backwages and all consequential benefits. The court also directs the respondents to ensure payment of arrears of salary within 10 days and payment of regular salary.

In the fourth order, the court allowed the petitions and granted the petitioners a cost of Rs. 2000. The respondents were directed to pay arrears of salary within 10 days and regular salary thereafter. The cost would be paid by the respondents, but they could hold the responsible officer accountable. The court also allowed the present writ petition by applying the same direction issued in a previous case. C.C. would be as per rules.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedure and natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court emphasizes that justice should not only be done but should also be seen to be done, and that following the principles of natural justice is essential to prevent miscarriage of justice and ensure equality and fairness. The court quashed the termination orders in all cases and ordered the petitioners to be given all consequential benefits, including backwages and regular salary. The respondents were directed to pay arrears of salary within 10 days and regular salary thereafter, and the court granted the petitioners a cost of Rs. 2000.
