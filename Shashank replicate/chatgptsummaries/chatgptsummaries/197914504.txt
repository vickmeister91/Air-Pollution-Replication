The National Green Tribunal (NGT) received an application from J. Mehta against various government bodies and private companies, including Ambience Developers, Bird Automotive, Home Centre, and Reliance Trends, for violating environmental laws and regulations in setting up a shopping mall in New Delhi. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, along with other statutory bodies, were responsible for implementing environmental laws and regulations. The applicant claimed that the violations of laws and regulations by the respondents had a negative impact on the environment, human health, and safety. The case was heard by a panel of judges on October 24, 2013.

In another case, a company sought clearance under environmental laws to construct a building. The company submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report to obtain the clearance, which included details of the building's size and layout. The clearance was granted with specific conditions, including the installation of a sewage treatment plant and periodic monitoring of pollution levels. However, the applicant alleges that the company has violated the clearance conditions by using areas meant for parking as commercial spaces. The court is examining the matter to determine if the company has indeed violated the clearance conditions and if action needs to be taken to ensure compliance.

The court order discusses a case where Respondent No.9 has violated the conditions of the Environmental Clearance (EC) and sanctioned plans, leading to hazardous environmental conditions. The applicant claims that the changes in construction have drastically affected safety norms and public health. Respondent No.9 argues that they have not breached the EC or EIA Report and are entitled to additional FAR. The DDA has filed a detailed reply-affidavit stating that any additional FAR beyond the permissible limit cannot be allowed on the existing structure. The court has conducted inspections and found that there is misuse of the premises for commercial purposes instead of parking.

The court order discusses the misuse of space meant for parking at a mall in Delhi, including unauthorized constructions and unapproved use of basements for commercial purposes. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee and other authorities have found deficiencies in the mall's operations, including the excessive use of underground water without permission. The court has ordered an investigation into the violations committed by the mall and its impact on the environment and local population.

The court order discusses an inspection of a property occupied by Big Bazar Family Center and Big Bazar, where commercial activities were found to be carried out in areas meant for parking. The court must determine if the application is maintainable and if Respondent No.9 has violated any laws related to the environment. The NGT Act gives the Tribunal wide jurisdiction to deal with civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The court must determine if the conditions requisite for its acquiring seisin of that matter are satisfied. The right to appeal in terms of Section 16 of the NGT Act is available to any person aggrieved. The Tribunal has a much wider jurisdiction in terms of Section 14 of the NGT Act, whereunder it can deal with and decide all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment is involved and it arises in regard to implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and purpose of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, which was enacted to provide for the establishment of a tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court emphasizes the importance of the preamble of the NGT Act in interpreting its provisions and outlines the jurisdiction of the tribunal, which includes hearing disputes relating to environmental protection and conservation, enforcement of legal rights relating to the environment, and awarding relief and compensation for damages to persons and property. The court also examines the case made by the applicant in their application and the essential features of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report that formed the basis for the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) to the project proponent.

The court order discusses the process of obtaining environmental clearance (EC) for building and construction projects. The Expert Appraisal Committee or State level Appraisal Committee determines the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project, and the project proponent submits an EIA Report in response. The Expert Appraisal Committee then makes recommendations for acceptance or rejection of the proposal, and the competent authority grants the EC. The court emphasizes that the EC covers all facets of the project, including construction, utilization of space, user of space, provision of services, sewage treatment, etc. Any change in these aspects would require a fresh appraisal by the competent authority. The court also notes that the FAR, construction, and user of space are essential considerations for EC, and any alteration in these facets would require fresh EC/appraisal. The court rejects the argument of Respondent No.9 that there was a change in the FAR from 100 to 125 in the MPD 2021, and that they were entitled to use the increased FAR in the basement, other parking, and service areas for commercial purposes. The court notes that the DDA has not granted any permission for change in use, and other public authorities have not granted fire clearance, permission for commercial use, or consent for extraction of underground water. The MoEF has also stated that the alleged use of basement and multi-level block for commercial operations is in violation of building guidelines and an absolute breach of the EC granted to the project proponent.

The court order approves the extraction of underground water due to increased
