The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Sajeev Kumar regarding the claims of certain individuals to conduct food stalls and hotels in temporary sheds along the Plappally-Pampa route under the jurisdictional control of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) in connection with Sabarimala Temple. The court considered whether the petitioners can claim an inviolable right to conduct their business under the strength of the license issued by the TDB without necessary permission being obtained from either the Forest Department or from the Government of India under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court found that the petitioners would not be entitled to claim occupation or possession of the area in question beyond the designated months of November to January each year, at least until such time fresh sanction is granted by the Government of India under the Act. This means that the individuals who were conducting food stalls and hotels in temporary sheds along the Plappally-Pampa route will not be able to do so outside of the designated months without obtaining necessary permission from the Forest Department or the Government of India.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the area in question falls under the jurisdiction of the Forest Department and is therefore subject to the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Act requires that any activity that involves the use of forest land for non-forest purposes must be approved by the Government of India. The court found that the petitioners had not obtained the necessary permission from the Forest Department or the Government of India and therefore could not claim an inviolable right to conduct their business in the area.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the legal position of individuals who conduct business in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of the Forest Department. It also highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions before conducting any activity that involves the use of forest land for non-forest purposes.

The court's decision is likely to have an impact on the business activities of individuals who conduct food stalls and hotels in temporary sheds along the Plappally-Pampa route. These individuals will now have to obtain necessary permissions from the Forest Department or the Government of India before conducting their business outside of the designated months.

Overall, the court's decision is a reminder of the importance of complying with legal requirements when conducting business activities in areas that fall under the jurisdiction of government departments. It also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of the legal position of their business activities and to take necessary steps to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
