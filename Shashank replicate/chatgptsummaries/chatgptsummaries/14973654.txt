The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to pollution and encroachment issues in various canals and distributories in the state of Rajasthan, India. The first court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Amit Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court also noted that one of the related cases, WP No. 718/2009, had been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for final disposal.

The second court order pertains to pollution caused in the water running through the distributories of Ganga Nahar Canal and Ganga Nahar itself. The court directed the state to come up with comprehensive short-term and long-term schemes to render the canal and its distributories free of encroachments and contamination. The state was also directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court ordered the state to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court also directed the state to place before it the steps taken for construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. The case was listed for further hearing on 9th October 2015.

The third court order directs the State of Rajasthan to comply with previous orders to remove encroachments and fence the boundary of the land abutting the canal passing through municipal areas. The State is also directed to issue show cause notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures contributing to contamination of the canal water. The compliance report filed by the State does not disclose the number of encroachers who obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court orders all encroachments to be removed within one month and directs various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments.

The fourth court order directs the state government to comply with the removal of encroachments and pollution in the canal area. The government is also ordered to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and collect compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court expresses disappointment with the lack of compliance and orders the district collector to appear before the tribunal. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the government's actions should approach the National Green Tribunal. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.

The fifth court order discusses the writ of certiorari, which can be used to set aside an order passed by a judicial or quasi-judicial authority. The court can exercise this power even if an appeal or revision is available, if the error committed by the lower court is so patent that it cannot be cured by other remedies. However, the court has discretion in deciding whether to invoke writ jurisdiction or not. In this particular case, the court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with appropriate application/representation. The NGT has the power to condone the delay caused in approaching it and is expected to consider the application/representations sympathetically. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December, 2016.

The sixth and final court order sympathetically considers the representations filed by the petitioner(s) and clarifies that the state can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT after December 31, 2016. The stay petition is disposed of.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of addressing pollution and encroachment issues in canals and distributories in the state of Rajasthan. The court has issued various directives to the state government to take effective measures to remove encroachments and contamination, and to provide safe drinking water to affected villages. The court has also emphasized the principle of polluter pays and the need to exhaust all other remedies before approaching the writ court. The National Green Tribunal has been identified as an important forum for addressing these issues, and the court has encouraged petitioners to approach the NGT with appropriate applications/representations.
