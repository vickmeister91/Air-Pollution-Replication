The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the management and handling of municipal solid waste in the city of Patna, Bihar, India. The first order involves a dispute between the Managing Director of Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation and JITF Urban Infrastructure Ltd. The appellant is questioning a judgment that found the Corporation's invoking of a bank guarantee to be unjustified and set aside the order to blacklist the company. The court upholds the decision to quash the blacklisting but must consider the encashment of the bank guarantee. The respondent argues that the Corporation concealed information about an earlier agreement and made a deliberate misrepresentation, justifying their withdrawal from the negotiations. The court finds that the learned Single Judge did not commit an error in quashing the decision to blacklist the company but must further consider the encashment of the bank guarantee.

The second court order discusses a case involving the invocation of a bank guarantee and whether it can be questioned in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The learned Single Judge had previously ruled that the invocation of the bank guarantee was illegal due to non-disclosure of previous agreements and litigation. The court is now analyzing this ruling and the background of the case, which involves the need for infrastructure development for solid waste management in Patna. The court has adjourned the matter until April 16, 2019, and has ordered that no further coercive steps be taken by the respondent-petitioner.

The third court order outlines the responsibilities of municipal authorities in implementing rules for the management of municipal solid waste. Rule 4 makes them responsible for infrastructure development and compliance with the rules, while Rule 5 assigns overall responsibility for enforcement to the Secretary-in-charge of the Department of Urban Development and the District Magistrate or Deputy Commissioner. Schedule-II provides compliance criteria for collection and segregation of waste, including prohibiting littering, organizing house-to-house collection, and promoting recycling and reuse. Municipal authorities must also meet specifications and standards for waste processing and disposal facilities.

The fourth court order requires municipal authorities to hold regular meetings with local resident welfare associations and NGOs to establish and maintain storage facilities for municipal solid waste. The storage facilities must meet certain criteria, including being accessible, aesthetically acceptable, and user-friendly. Vehicles used for waste transportation must be covered, and waste should not be visible to the public. Biodegradable waste must be processed through composting or other biological processing, and non-biodegradable waste should be landfilled according to specified norms. The selected landfill site must meet certain specifications outlined in Schedule-III. The order also mentions that the Patna Municipal Corporation has informed the court that they have 77 acres of land available.

The fifth court order directs the Municipal Corporation of Patna to implement the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000 for the collection, segregation, storage, transportation, and disposal of solid waste in the city. The order also requires the Corporation to acquire land for landfill sites and submit a compliance report by January 3, 2009. The court expresses concern about the lack of civic amenities and the poor living conditions in Patna and emphasizes the importance of implementing the Rules to restore hygienic conditions in the city. The court also criticizes the Corporation for its inaction and lack of transparency and accountability in implementing the Rules.

The sixth court order requires the Patna Municipal Corporation to educate residents on solid waste segregation and disclose information about waste collection and transportation. Non-governmental organizations may be enlisted to help with education. The order also requires the corporation to establish a grievance cell for residents to report any issues with the waste management system. The corporation has been given six weeks to comply with these directives. The order references a contract awarded to a private company for waste management services in the Patna Municipal Corporation area.

The seventh court order pertains to a dispute between the Patna Municipal Corporation and a contractor, M/s. A2Z Infrastructure Limited, regarding the cleaning and maintenance of certain areas in Patna. The court directed the corporation to pay the contractor its dues along with interest, but also noted that the contractor had stopped work and was not entitled to any further relief. The corporation subsequently took steps to award a new contract under the Public Private Partnership model, which the contractor challenged in court. However, the court found no impediment to the award of the new contract.

The eighth court order discusses a case where a corporation awarded a contract to a bidder, but the bidder withdrew from the contract due to alleged suppression of information about a previous dispute with another contractor. The corporation invoked the bank guarantee and the bidder challenged it in court. The court found that the bank guarantee could be invoked as the bidder failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the bidding documents by not signing the agreement. The court also noted that there was no stipulation for forfeiture of the bid security amount if the successful bidder withdrew from the project, but the withdrawal was a voluntary act of the bidder. The court found that the learned Single Judge committed an error in assuming that the bidder had the option to withdraw from the contract after the acceptance and acknowledgment of the letter of award.

The ninth court order pertains to a case where a contract was awarded to a respondent-petitioner, but the petitioner withdrew from signing the contract due to non-disclosure of past litigation by the corporation. The learned Single Judge had presumed that the litigation gave rise to a reasonable cause of apprehension in the mind of
