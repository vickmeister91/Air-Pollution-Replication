In a recent court order, Vijay Gond was denied bail on charges of illegal trade of endangered species tortoise and possession of scales of pangolin, which is on the verge of extinction. The prosecution claimed that Gond was an important link as a middle man between the hunters/catchers of endangered tortoises and was found in possession of pangolin scales. The defense argued that Gond had no criminal record and no tortoises were seized from his possession. However, the court found that Gond was not entitled to be released on bail.

The case against Gond is related to the illegal trade of endangered species, which is a serious offense. The prosecution has claimed that Gond was involved in the trade of endangered tortoises and was found in possession of pangolin scales. The pangolin is a critically endangered species, and its scales are in high demand in the illegal wildlife trade. The prosecution has argued that Gond was an important link in the illegal trade of these species and that his release on bail would pose a threat to the environment and the endangered species.

The defense, on the other hand, has argued that Gond has no criminal record and that no tortoises were seized from his possession. They have also argued that Gond is not a flight risk and that he has cooperated with the investigation. However, the court has found that the charges against Gond are serious and that his release on bail would not be in the interest of justice.

The court's decision to deny bail to Gond is based on several factors. Firstly, the charges against him are serious and relate to the illegal trade of endangered species. Secondly, the prosecution has claimed that Gond was an important link in the illegal trade of these species, and his release on bail would pose a threat to the environment and the endangered species. Thirdly, the court has found that Gond is not entitled to be released on bail, given the seriousness of the charges against him.

In conclusion, the court's decision to deny bail to Vijay Gond on charges of illegal trade of endangered species tortoise and possession of scales of pangolin is a significant step in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. The court has recognized the seriousness of the charges against Gond and has taken into account the threat that his release on bail would pose to the environment and the endangered species. The decision sends a strong message that the illegal trade of endangered species will not be tolerated, and those involved in such activities will be held accountable for their actions.
