In a recent court order, the Kerala High Court has directed the Department of Mining and Geology, Palakkad District, to consider the application of Sudheer, who was denied a mining permit and transit passes for carrying out mining operations on his land. Sudheer had filed a writ petition challenging the decision of the respondents to deny him the permit and passes citing the need for an environmental clearance certificate.

The court examined the relevant notifications under the Environment Protection Act and Rules as well as the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015, and found that Sudheer did not require an environmental clearance certificate for the construction of a building with a plinth area of up to 300M2. The court observed that the mining operations proposed by Sudheer were not likely to cause any significant adverse impact on the environment and therefore, an environmental clearance certificate was not necessary.

The court also noted that the respondents had not considered the application of Sudheer on its merits and had simply rejected it on the ground of non-availability of an environmental clearance certificate. The court directed the respondents to consider Sudheer's application for a mining permit and transit passes and not insist on an environmental clearance certificate.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the requirement of an environmental clearance certificate for mining operations. The court has held that such a certificate is necessary only if the mining operations are likely to cause significant adverse impact on the environment. The court has also emphasized the need for the authorities to consider the applications of the applicants on their merits and not reject them on technical grounds.

The court order is a welcome relief for Sudheer and other similarly situated persons who have been denied mining permits and transit passes on the ground of non-availability of an environmental clearance certificate. The order will also have a positive impact on the mining industry in the state as it will remove the unnecessary burden of obtaining environmental clearance certificates for small-scale mining operations.

In conclusion, the court order is a significant development in the legal landscape of mining operations in Kerala. The court has clarified the legal position on the requirement of an environmental clearance certificate for mining operations and has emphasized the need for the authorities to consider the applications of the applicants on their merits. The order will have a positive impact on the mining industry in the state and will remove the unnecessary burden of obtaining environmental clearance certificates for small-scale mining operations.
