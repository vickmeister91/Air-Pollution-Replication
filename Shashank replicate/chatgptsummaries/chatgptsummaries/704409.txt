The Karnataka High Court recently heard two petitions challenging the jurisdiction of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to take action under Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for the alleged offence of polluting air and water and preventing public nuisance. The court considered whether the Sub-Divisional Magistrate had jurisdiction to take action under Section 133 of the Cr.P.C. after the Water Air Pollution and Environment (Protection) Laws came into force. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered previous court decisions on the matter. Ultimately, the court found that the Water and Air Acts are special statutes that provide all remedies to the charges and that the Sub-Divisional Magistrate has no jurisdiction to proceed under Section 133 of the Act.

The court order also discusses the application of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act in cases of repeal of an enactment followed by fresh legislation on the same subject. The court states that Section 6 will apply unless the new legislation manifests an intention incompatible with or contrary to the provisions of the section. The court also examines the relationship between the Water Air Pollution and Environment (Protection) Laws and Section 133 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and concludes that the former does not impliedly repeal the latter. The court emphasizes that Section 133 deals with remedial measures, while the Pollution Control Acts deal with preventive measures. The court dismisses the petitions and directs the Sub-Divisional Magistrates to proceed with the cases.
