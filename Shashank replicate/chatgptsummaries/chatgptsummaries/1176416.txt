In a case involving a dispute over ownership of a piece of land in Masla village, Latur District, the plaintiff failed to establish his right to a 1/2 share in the land. The land had been sold to defendant No. 1 in 1918 by the Pattedar of the land. The plaintiff claimed that his grandfather had a 1/2 share in the land and that he was entitled to it as his successor in title. However, both courts held that the plaintiff failed to prove his title to the land.

The plaintiff relied on an entry in the village records showing his grandfather as a 'Shikmidar' to the extent of 1/2 share in the land, but this was not enough to prove ownership. The defendant No. 1 claimed full ownership of the land, and the sale deed was attested by the plaintiff's grandfather. The burden of proving title rested on the plaintiff, who failed to produce any document of title.

The case highlights the importance of having proper documentation to establish ownership of property. In this case, the plaintiff was unable to produce any document of title to prove his claim to the land. The entry in the village records was not sufficient to establish ownership, and the sale deed attested by the plaintiff's grandfather supported the defendant's claim to full ownership.

The court's decision to dismiss the appeal underscores the need for individuals to ensure that they have proper documentation to establish their ownership of property. Without such documentation, it can be difficult to prove ownership in a court of law.

In conclusion, the case involving the dispute over ownership of the land in Masla village serves as a reminder of the importance of having proper documentation to establish ownership of property. The plaintiff's failure to produce any document of title ultimately led to the dismissal of his appeal, highlighting the need for individuals to ensure that they have proper documentation to support their claims of ownership.
