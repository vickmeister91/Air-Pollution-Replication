The case at hand involves an application filed by the petitioner, Rajiv Naidu, under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. for the production of the general diary of the respondent station for a period from 30.03.2007 to 08.11.2008. The learned Magistrate dismissed the petitioner's application on the grounds that the general diary could not be produced since its preservation period is only for three years as per the Police Standing Order.

The petitioner then filed Crl.M.P.No.2176 of 2014 for summoning the orders of the competent authority who had ordered for the destruction of the records. The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, allowed the said application on 11.07.2014 and directed the prosecution to produce the records.

Based on a letter submitted by the respondent police, the learned Magistrate passed an order on 18.08.2015 observing that the petitioner can cross-examine the Investigating Officer at the time of his cross-examination since the records were not traceable. The present petition was filed challenging the said order.

The petitioner argued that the learned Magistrate erred in allowing the respondent police to rely on a letter to claim that the records were not traceable. The petitioner contended that the respondent police had not produced any evidence to show that the records were destroyed in accordance with the Police Standing Order.

The court noted that the learned Magistrate had allowed the petitioner to cross-examine the Investigating Officer at the time of his cross-examination since the records were not traceable. The court observed that the learned Magistrate had not considered the fact that the respondent police had not produced any evidence to show that the records were destroyed in accordance with the Police Standing Order.

The court held that the learned Magistrate had erred in allowing the respondent police to rely on a letter to claim that the records were not traceable. The court observed that the respondent police had not produced any evidence to show that the records were destroyed in accordance with the Police Standing Order.

The court further held that the learned Magistrate had erred in allowing the petitioner to cross-examine the Investigating Officer at the time of his cross-examination since the records were not traceable. The court observed that the petitioner had a right to inspect the records under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and that the learned Magistrate should have directed the respondent police to produce the records.

In light of the above, the court allowed the Criminal Original Petition and set aside the order in C.C.No.2412 of 2012 dated 18.08.2015 on the file of the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore. The court directed the respondent police to produce the records as sought by the petitioner under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.
