The Rajasthan High Court issued an order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10317/2009 on August 24, 2009. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the petitioner challenging an order passed by the Member Secretary of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB). The impugned order had directed the petitioner to stop the operation of his factory until he obtained a consent to operate from the RSPCB.

The court directed that a notice be issued to the respondents and that the operation of the impugned order in question be stayed until further orders. The court also noted that the Board alone is empowered under Section 31-A of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the impugned order had been passed by the Member Secretary, to whom no power had been delegated by the authority competent under the Act, 1981.

The court's order was significant as it highlighted the importance of following due process and ensuring that the appropriate authority is empowered to make decisions under the relevant legislation. The court's decision to stay the operation of the impugned order until further orders also provided relief to the petitioner, who was able to continue operating his factory until the matter was resolved.

The court's decision was also significant as it highlighted the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that pollution control measures are implemented effectively. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a key piece of legislation that is aimed at preventing and controlling air pollution in India. The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution, and to enforce the provisions of the Act.

The court's decision in this case was in line with the objectives of the Act, as it ensured that the appropriate authority was empowered to make decisions regarding pollution control measures. The court's decision also ensured that due process was followed, and that the petitioner's rights were protected.

Overall, the Rajasthan High Court's order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 10317/2009 was a significant decision that highlighted the importance of following due process and ensuring that the appropriate authority is empowered to make decisions under the relevant legislation. The court's decision also provided relief to the petitioner, who was able to continue operating his factory until the matter was resolved. The court's decision was in line with the objectives of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and highlighted the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that pollution control measures are implemented effectively.
