The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by M/S Ardent Steel Limited against the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the State Pollution Control Board, Odisha. The company had applied for Environmental Clearance for an expansion of its pelletization plant, but the Expert Appraisal Committee deferred the consideration of the expansion due to the existing plant running without prior Environmental Clearance. The company argued that a 'stand alone' pelletization plant did not require Environmental Clearance under the Regulations of 2006. The Committee acknowledged a conflict of opinion regarding the applicability of the Regulations on iron ore pellet plants between the State Board and the MoEF. The company was asked to regularize its statutory approvals and take Environmental Clearance within six months. The company received a letter asking it to stop production as it had not obtained Environmental Clearance, which was in conflict with the assurance given in the EAC meeting.

The court order pertains to M/s Ardent Steel Limited's application for expansion of their iron ore pelletizing plant in Odisha. The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) had requested the company to make a presentation for the grant of Terms of Reference (ToR) for the proposed expansion. However, the Expert Appraisal Committee (Industry) deferred the consideration of the proposal as the company had already established and was operating a 0.6 MTPA iron ore pelletization plant without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The MoEF issued a directive to stop the production of the plant until the required environmental clearance was obtained. The company challenged the order, stating that a 'stand alone' pelletization plant did not require environmental clearance. The court discussed the interpretation and scope of Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 and reserved its decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the requirements for environmental clearance for certain industrial units, including those producing toxic and heavy metals, and those with a capacity of over 30,000 tonnes per annum. The Environmental Protection Act of 1986 empowers the Central Government to take measures to protect and improve the environment, issue directions to comply with environmental regulations, and make rules regarding environmental standards and hazardous substances. The Environmental Protection Rules of 1986 outline factors to consider when prohibiting or restricting the location of industries and require a procedure for objections before implementing such restrictions.

The court order discusses the regulations and procedures for obtaining environmental clearance for industrial projects in India. The court emphasizes the importance of preventing and controlling pollution and adopting a liberal interpretation of social welfare legislation to ensure the object and purpose of the Act is not defeated. The court also notes that pelletization, a process used in the manufacturing of steel, causes serious pollution and must be checked and controlled in accordance with the law.

The court order discusses the environmental impact of the process of pelletization in the steel industry and the need for compliance with environmental laws. The court examines the meaning of the term "metallurgical industry" and its two functions, primary and secondary metallurgical processes. The court emphasizes the importance of preventing pollution and maintaining anti-pollution measures in the interest of the environment. The court also discusses the need for a liberal interpretation of the term "industry" in socio-welfare legislation.

The court order discusses the difference between primary and secondary metallurgical processes, with primary involving the production of metal from ore and secondary involving the production of alloys from ingots and recovery of metal from scrap. The order also examines whether pelletization, a process used in the production of steel, falls under primary or secondary metallurgy and concludes that it falls under primary metallurgy. The order notes that pelletization is a source of pollution and requires anti-pollution devices to be used. The order also discusses conflicting views on whether pelletization requires environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forest.

The court order states that iron ore pellet plants fall under Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 and come under category 'A', which requires Environmental Clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). The MoEF has taken a considered view that a 'stand alone' pelletization plant would require Environmental Clearance under the Regulations of 2006. The court has no hesitation in holding that pelletization is a process which squarely falls under the head "primary metallurgical industry".

The court order states that pelletization is a process that falls under the primary metallurgical industry and therefore requires environmental clearance under the Regulations of 2006. The appellant is granted the liberty to seek environmental clearance for a stand-alone pelletization plant within one month, and the unit must operate in accordance with the law upon grant of clearance. The MoEF and State Pollution Control Boards are directed to require stand-alone pelletization plants to obtain environmental clearance immediately. The possibility of allowing such units to operate during the interregnum of applying for clearance is left to the discretion of the competent authorities. The appeal is dismissed with the above directions, and the parties are left to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to M/s Ardent Steel Limited's application for expansion of their iron ore pelletizing plant in Odisha. The company had already established and was operating a 0.6 MTPA iron ore pelletization plant without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The court discussed the interpretation and scope of Entry 3(a) of the Schedule to the Regulations of 2006 and concluded that pelletization is a process that falls under the primary metallurgical industry and therefore requires environmental clearance under the
