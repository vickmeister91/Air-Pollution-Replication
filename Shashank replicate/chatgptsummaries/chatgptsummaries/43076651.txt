The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by various individuals and an association called "Pulichintala Project Porata Sambhavana Committee" challenging the commencement of the Pulichintala Project without obtaining environmental clearance. The petitioners allege that the project will submerge the lands of farmers in Guntur and Nalgonda districts and violate principles of natural justice. The State Government argues that the work being undertaken is only for assessing soil parameters and does not require environmental clearance.

The court has ordered that the stand of the State Government on the merits of the project is premature and that the only question at this stage is whether the State Government can proceed with the project without environmental clearance. The locus standi of the petitioners has been challenged, but the court has rejected this objection and held that the petition is filed in public interest.

The court order states that procedural technicalities are relaxed in petitions filed to redress public injury, enforce public duty, protect social rights, vindicate public interest and rule of law, effect access to justice to economical weaker class and meaningful realization of fundamental rights. The court also emphasizes that a balance must be struck in public interest litigation between two conflicting interests. The court rejects objections raised about jurisdiction and maintainability of the writ petition, stating that it has been filed bona fide and is in public interest. The court also emphasizes the need for environmental clearance before the implementation of the project.

The court order discusses the procedure for obtaining environmental clearance for new projects listed in Schedule I of the Notification. The State of Andhra Pradesh is seeking clearance for the Pulichintala Major Irrigation Project, but has not yet submitted the required application with accompanying documents, including an Environmental Impact Assessment Report and Environmental Management Plan. The court emphasizes the mandatory nature of environmental clearance and the need to follow the procedure meticulously. The State Government cannot flout the directions of the Supreme Court or laws made by Parliament.

The court order states that the State Government cannot flout the directions of the Supreme Court or laws made by Parliament, and must ensure compliance with them.
