The court order pertains to a criminal misc. petition filed by Bajrang Lal Gupta under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Special Judge, C.B.I. Cases, Jodhpur, rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. read with Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act. Gupta is facing trial for various offences and had sought to summon certain documents from the Assistant Manager, State Bank of India, Jaipur. However, the trial court rejected the application while holding that none of the documents is necessary and desirable for the trial of the case.

Gupta argued that the trial court has grossly erred in rejecting the application filed by him. The court heard both parties and perused the impugned order. The court observed that the trial court has taken into consideration the relevancy of each and every document sought to be summoned by the petitioner in detail in the impugned order. The court held that the discretion exercised by the trial court while deciding any application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is not liable to be lightly interfered with.

The court cited Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. which empowers the court to summon any document or thing which it deems "necessary or desirable" for the purpose of any inquiry or trial. However, the court held that the trial court must be allowed a large latitude in the matter of exercise of discretion and unless it demonstrates that the trial court has failed to exercise its jurisdiction or its action resulted in gross failure of justice, the High Court should not intervene very lightly as a matter of course or for mere asking.

The court order also mentions that the petitioner is accused of enhancing loan account limits and transferring the enhanced amount to his own and other accounts. The court examined the necessity and desirability of the documents requested by the petitioner for the just decision of the case. After considering all the relevant factors, the court dismissed the criminal misc. petition and the stay petition.

In summary, the court order deals with a criminal misc. petition filed by Bajrang Lal Gupta against the order passed by the trial court rejecting his application to summon certain documents. The court held that the trial court's discretion in deciding any application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is not liable to be lightly interfered with and must be allowed a large latitude. The court examined the necessity and desirability of the documents requested by the petitioner and dismissed the criminal misc. petition and the stay petition.
