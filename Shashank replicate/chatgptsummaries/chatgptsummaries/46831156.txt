The State of Rajasthan has been the subject of multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners, including companies and individuals involved in the mining and marble industries. These petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances, and the court order provides details of each petition and petitioner.

One of the petitions concerns an illegal demand notice for compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining activities. The petitioner had already deposited compensation for the land diversion, but the government demanded additional compensation under a new policy. The court reviewed the policy and found that the government was entitled to demand the compensation, and therefore dismissed the writ petitions.

Another petition involves a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

A third petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to issue directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

In another petition, the court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to relinquish the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed leases to the Forest Department.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complex legal and technical issues involved in mining and forest land use in Rajasthan. The court has had to consider various factors, including the status of mining leases, the payment of compensation, and the validity of forest clearances. The orders provide important guidance for companies and individuals involved in these industries, as well as for government officials responsible for regulating them.
