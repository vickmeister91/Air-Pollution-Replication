The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission heard a complaint filed by Surinder Singh Grewal against Puma Realtors Pvt. Ltd. The complainant had applied for a residential plot in the project of the opposite party and had paid an initial amount of Rs. 6,50,000. The complainant was allotted a plot and made further payments as per the demand raised by the opposite party. The commission heard arguments from both sides and made a decision on April 17, 2017.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by a plot buyer against the developer for deficiency in service and unfair trade practices. The buyer alleged that the developer did not carry out internal development work as per the agreement and did not hand over possession of the plot within the stipulated time. The buyer sought a refund of the amount paid along with interest and compensation for mental harassment. The developer denied the allegations and claimed that the buyer defaulted on payment and possession was offered as per the agreement. The court examined the evidence and found that the possession was offered before the complaint was filed and the development work was not completed. The court also dismissed the developer's objection to the jurisdiction of the consumer court due to the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 3 of the 1986 Act and Section 8 of the 1996 Act in relation to consumer complaints and arbitration agreements. The court concludes that the existence of an arbitration clause does not prevent consumer fora from entertaining complaints filed by consumers, as Section 3 of the 1986 Act provides an additional remedy. The court also rejects the argument that the complainant purchased the plot for investment purposes and therefore does not fall within the definition of a consumer. The court emphasizes that the 1986 Act was enacted to protect poor consumers against powerful service providers and that the complainant's case should be decided within the framework of this Act.

The court order states that a person cannot be considered to have purchased a house for commercial purposes just because they own or have purchased more than one house. However, if they are engaged in the business of buying and selling houses or plots for profit, then it can be considered a commercial purpose. The complainant in this case is considered a consumer under the Consumer Protection Act and the complaint is maintainable as housing construction falls under the definition of a service. The objection raised by the opposite parties regarding territorial jurisdiction is rejected as the Consumer Foras are bound by the provisions of Section 11 of the Act. The clause in the agreement limiting jurisdiction to a particular court or forum cannot be given importance and the complaint can be filed where a part of the cause of action arose.

The court order discusses a complaint filed against Puma Realtors Limited for offering incomplete possession of a plot without necessary approvals and basic amenities. The court rejected the objection raised by the Opposite Parties and held that the possession offered was not complete and legal. The court also held that the complainant is entitled to a refund of the entire amount deposited by him. The court referred to the Plot Buyer's Agreement and stated that the Opposite Parties were liable to pay compensation calculated at the rate of Rs.50/- per sq. yard of the area every month until possession is actually handed over.

The court order pertains to two consumer complaints against a real estate company for not delivering possession of plots within the stipulated time and not refunding the deposited amount. The court held that the complainants were entitled to a refund of the deposited amount along with interest at 13% per annum. The court also awarded compensation for mental agony and physical harassment and deficiency in providing service. The court directed the real estate company to make the payment within 45 days, failing which they would be liable to pay interest at 15% per annum.

The court order requires the Opposite Parties to pay a certain amount to the complainants within 45 days of receiving a certified copy of the order. If the payment is not made within the stipulated period, the Opposite Parties will be liable to pay the amount with interest. However, if the complainants have availed a loan facility from any financial institution, such an institution shall have the first charge on the amount payable. Certified copies of the order will be placed in the file of complaint and sent to the parties free of charge. The file will be consigned to the Record Room after completion.
