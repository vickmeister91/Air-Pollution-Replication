A recent court order has been issued in a case involving the Baroda City Co-operative Bank Ltd and the State of Gujarat. The case has been ongoing, and during a recent hearing, the petitioner's advocate requested more time to obtain further instructions from the bank. The respondent's advocate, on the other hand, sought time for the investigating officer to be present in court with investigation papers. The court granted both requests and set a new date for the hearing.

The Baroda City Co-operative Bank Ltd is a co-operative bank based in the city of Vadodara in the state of Gujarat. The bank has been in operation for several years and has a large customer base. However, the bank has been facing some legal issues in recent times, which have led to the current case.

The case involves allegations of financial irregularities and fraud at the bank. The State of Gujarat has accused the bank of misusing funds and engaging in illegal activities. The bank has denied these allegations and has been fighting the case in court.

During the recent hearing, the petitioner's advocate requested more time to obtain further instructions from the bank. It is not clear what instructions the advocate was seeking, but it is likely that they were related to the allegations made by the State of Gujarat. The advocate may have been seeking clarification on certain points or may have been trying to gather more evidence to support the bank's case.

The respondent's advocate, on the other hand, sought time for the investigating officer to be present in court with investigation papers. This suggests that the State of Gujarat is still gathering evidence to support its case against the bank. The investigating officer may have been conducting an investigation into the bank's activities and may have uncovered new evidence that they wish to present in court.

The court granted both requests and set a new date for the hearing. This is a common practice in legal proceedings, as it allows both parties to gather the necessary evidence and prepare their arguments. The new date for the hearing has not been announced, but it is likely to be in the near future.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the case involving the Baroda City Co-operative Bank Ltd and the State of Gujarat has granted both parties more time to prepare their arguments. The petitioner's advocate has requested more time to obtain further instructions from the bank, while the respondent's advocate has sought time for the investigating officer to be present in court with investigation papers. The court has granted both requests and set a new date for the hearing. The case is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what evidence will be presented in court and what the outcome of the case will be.
