The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition challenging the guidelines for nomination and terms of service of the Chairman, Members, and Member Secretary of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner objected to Clause 5 of the guidelines, which provides for the appointment of the Chairman by a Search-cum-Selection Committee consisting of the Chief Minister, Minister for Forest, Ecology and Environment, and Chief Secretary to the Government. The petitioner argued that the Search Committee and Selection Committee should be separate, and the appointment of the Chairman and Members should be made by the State Government by nomination.

The Court considered the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which provides for the constitution of State Boards, and the decision of the Apex Court in the case of TECHI TAGI TARA vs RAJENDRA SINGH BHANDARI AND OTHERS. The Court noted that the power to appoint the Chairman and Members of the State Pollution Control Board vests with the State Government by nomination. The Court also observed that the guidelines laid down by the State Government were not illegal, subject to the qualifications laid down by the Apex Court and the Water Act.

The Court directed the Executive in all states to frame appropriate guidelines or recruitment rules within six months to ensure that suitable professionals and experts are appointed to the State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). The Court emphasized that any compromise in the appointment of experts would render the exercise undertaken by the State Boards irrelevant and redundant. The Court also made it clear that in the event the Chairman or the Members of SPCBs appointed by the State Government do not meet the statutory or constitutional requirements, it is always open for a public-spirited person to seek a writ of quo warranto.

The Court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that the State Pollution Control Boards are staffed by qualified professionals and experts. The Court's direction to the Executive to frame appropriate guidelines or recruitment rules within six months is a welcome move, as it will help to ensure that the State Pollution Control Boards are able to carry out their functions effectively.

The Court's decision also underscores the need for transparency and accountability in the appointment of the Chairman and Members of the State Pollution Control Boards. The Court's observation that any compromise in the appointment of experts would render the exercise undertaken by the State Boards irrelevant and redundant is a reminder that the appointment of qualified professionals and experts is crucial to the effective functioning of the State Pollution Control Boards.

Overall, the Court's decision is a positive step towards ensuring that the State Pollution Control Boards are staffed by qualified professionals and experts, and that their functions are carried out effectively. The Court's direction to the Executive to frame appropriate guidelines or recruitment rules within six months is a welcome move, and it is hoped that the Executive will take this opportunity to ensure that the State Pollution Control Boards are able to carry out their functions effectively.
