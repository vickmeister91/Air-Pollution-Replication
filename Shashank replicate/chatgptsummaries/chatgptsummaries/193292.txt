The Supreme Court of India issued a court order regarding a landlord's petition for eviction of a tenant under Section 10(3)(a)(i)(b) of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960. The case involved a demised building with both residential and non-residential portions, and the question of whether a petition for eviction is maintainable under a composite lease. The court examined the definition of "building" under the Act and concluded that a building with both residential and non-residential portions is within the ambit of the Act. The court also considered conflicting opinions among various High Courts on the maintainability of a petition for eviction under a composite lease and ultimately ruled in favor of the landlord.

The court order discussed various cases where the issue of eviction of a tenant from a premises with both residential and non-residential accommodation held under a composite lease was raised. Some courts held that such eviction is maintainable if the accommodation is primarily used for residential purposes, while others held the opposite view. The court also discussed the provisions of Section 13(1)(e) of the Delhi Act, which allows eviction of a tenant from a residential premises if the landlord requires it for personal use. The court concluded that the judgments under Section 13(1)(e) of the Delhi Act cannot be applied to cases arising under Section 10(3)(a) of the A.P. Act or Section 10(3)(a) of the T.N. Act, which are in haec verba. The court also considered whether a non-residential portion of a premises can be put to residential use with necessary changes and whether such premises can be treated as residential for the purpose of eviction.

The court order discussed the applicability of Section 10(3)(a) of the A.P. Act in cases where a building has both residential and non-residential portions and is let out under a composite lease. The court concluded that such a building falls within one of the categories of residential or non-residential, as classified in Section 2(iii) of the Act. The landlord has the right to seek eviction of the tenant on the ground of personal requirement, provided the requirements of Section 10(3)(a) are satisfied. The court rejected the argument that the landlord is without a remedy in such cases.

The court order discussed the classification of buildings under the A.P. Act as either residential or non-residential, and how a building with both residential and non-residential portions should be categorized. The court determined that a building let out under a composite lease should be categorized based on its nature, accommodation, dominant purpose of lease, primary use of the building, and other relevant circumstances. In the specific case discussed, the court determined that the demised building should be treated as a residential building, and therefore, the eviction petition filed by the landlord is maintainable. The court ordered the respondents to vacate the building and put the landlord in possession of the same by December 31, 1999.

In summary, the court order dealt with the issue of eviction of a tenant from a building with both residential and non-residential portions under a composite lease. The court examined the definition of "building" under the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 and concluded that such a building falls within one of the categories of residential or non-residential, as classified in Section 2(iii) of the Act. The court also considered conflicting opinions among various High Courts on the maintainability of a petition for eviction under a composite lease and ultimately ruled in favor of the landlord. The court ordered the respondents to vacate the building and put the landlord in possession of the same by December 31, 1999.
