Two court orders have been issued in civil suits for permanent injunctions filed by companies against workers' unions. In the first case, M/s Multi Springs & Engg. (P) Ltd filed a suit against Engineering Workers, claiming that the union had misled some of their workers to raise demands for annual holidays and appointment letters, causing obstruction and interference in the functioning of the company. The defendant denied the allegations and stated that the workers had legitimate demands for labor rights. The court held that it had jurisdiction to try the case and decreed the suit for permanent injunction, restraining the defendant from holding demonstrations and causing obstruction in the functioning of the plaintiff company.

In the second case, the plaintiff company sought a permanent injunction against the defendant union from holding demonstrations/dharnas outside the office of the plaintiff company. The court found that the defendant union had no right to hold demonstrations/dharnas that obstructed the functioning of the plaintiff company and interfered with the rights of other persons. The court granted a decree of permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiff, restraining the defendant from holding any demonstration/dharna within a radius of 50 meters from the outer wall of the office of the plaintiff company and from obstructing the ingress and egress of the willing workers or other officers of the plaintiff company and from interfering with the functioning of the plaintiff company.

Both cases involve disputes between companies and workers' unions over the right to hold demonstrations and protests. In the first case, the plaintiff company accused the defendant union of misleading workers to raise demands that obstructed the functioning of the company. The defendant union denied the allegations and claimed that the workers had legitimate demands for labor rights. The court held that it had jurisdiction to try the case and decreed a permanent injunction against the defendant union, restraining them from holding demonstrations and causing obstruction in the functioning of the plaintiff company.

In the second case, the plaintiff company sought a permanent injunction against the defendant union from holding demonstrations/dharnas outside their office. The court found that the defendant union had no right to hold demonstrations/dharnas that obstructed the functioning of the plaintiff company and interfered with the rights of other persons. The court granted a decree of permanent injunction in favor of the plaintiff, restraining the defendant from holding any demonstration/dharna within a radius of 50 meters from the outer wall of the office of the plaintiff company and from obstructing the ingress and egress of the willing workers or other officers of the plaintiff company and from interfering with the functioning of the plaintiff company.

In both cases, the courts have upheld the rights of companies to carry out their business without obstruction from workers' unions. The courts have also recognized the right of workers to demand labor rights but have held that such demands should not interfere with the functioning of the company or the rights of other persons. The courts have issued permanent injunctions against the defendant unions, restraining them from holding demonstrations and causing obstruction in the functioning of the plaintiff companies.

These court orders have significant implications for companies and workers' unions. Companies can now carry out their business without fear of obstruction from workers' unions. Workers' unions, on the other hand, will have to be careful in their demands for labor rights and ensure that such demands do not interfere with the functioning of the company or the rights of other persons. The courts have struck a balance between the rights of companies and workers' unions, recognizing the importance of both in a democratic society.

In conclusion, the court orders in these civil suits for permanent injunctions have upheld the rights of companies to carry out their business without obstruction from workers' unions. The courts have recognized the right of workers to demand labor rights but have held that such demands should not interfere with the functioning of the company or the rights of other persons.
