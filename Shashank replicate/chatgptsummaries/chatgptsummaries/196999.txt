The court order in question pertains to a challenge against an order passed by the Ombudsman for Local Self-Government Institutions. The order required telecommunication service providers to produce a no-objection certificate from the Atomic Energy Commission to enable the Panchayat to issue a license for the installation of mobile towers. The petitioner challenged this order, arguing that it was arbitrary and illegal.

The court, after hearing both sides, quashed the order passed by the Ombudsman. The court cited a previous judgment in favor of the petitioner, which had held that the requirement of a no-objection certificate from the Atomic Energy Commission was not necessary for the installation of mobile towers. The court held that the order passed by the Ombudsman was in direct contravention of this judgment and was therefore illegal.

However, the court also made it clear that the observations and directions in the previous judgment would be binding on the petitioner. This means that the petitioner would have to comply with the directions given in the previous judgment, even though the order passed by the Ombudsman had been quashed.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the requirement of a no-objection certificate from the Atomic Energy Commission for the installation of mobile towers. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the telecom industry, as it removes an unnecessary regulatory hurdle that had been causing delays in the installation of mobile towers.

The court's decision is also significant as it reaffirms the importance of following previous judgments. The court's decision makes it clear that previous judgments are binding on all parties, and that any order or direction that is in contravention of a previous judgment is illegal and can be quashed by the court.

Overall, the court's decision is a welcome development for the telecom industry, as it removes an unnecessary regulatory hurdle and paves the way for faster installation of mobile towers. The decision also reaffirms the importance of following previous judgments, which is a fundamental principle of the Indian legal system.
