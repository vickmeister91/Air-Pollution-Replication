The court order in question pertains to a bail application made under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with Forest Crime No. 47009/01, which was registered at Police Station Forest Range Rukhad Distt. Seoni for the offence under Sections 2, 9, 39, 48A, 49B, 50, 51, 52 and 57 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicant was accused of killing a tiger by fixing electric wire and keeping its skin, claws, teeth, etc. for selling purposes.

The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the committal/trial Court to appear before the court on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wild animals and plants and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. The Act also provides for penalties for offences related to the killing, hunting, or trade of wildlife.

In this case, the applicant was accused of killing a tiger, which is a protected species under the Act. The applicant was alleged to have used an electric wire to kill the tiger and then kept its skin, claws, teeth, etc. for selling purposes. Such actions are clearly prohibited under the Act and are punishable by law.

The court, however, allowed the bail application filed by the applicant. Bail is a legal provision that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. The grant of bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the furnishing of a bail bond and the provision of a surety. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person appears before the court on the dates given by the concerned court.

In this case, the court directed the applicant to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the committal/trial Court. This means that the applicant will have to provide a sum of Rs. 30,000/- as security to the court, and also provide a person who will act as a surety and guarantee that the applicant will appear before the court on the dates given by the concerned court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors. One of the factors is the nature of the offence. While the offence of killing a tiger is a serious offence, the court may have considered the fact that the applicant is only an accused person at this stage and has not been convicted of the offence. The court may have also considered the fact that the applicant has a right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

Another factor that the court may have considered is the likelihood of the applicant absconding or tampering with evidence. The court may have considered the applicant's past record, if any, and the likelihood of the applicant fleeing from justice. The court may have also considered the fact that the applicant has a permanent address and is not likely to abscond.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is not a final decision on the merits of the case. The case will now proceed to trial, and the court will have to decide whether the applicant is guilty or not guilty of the offence. The grant of bail does not mean that the applicant is free from all legal proceedings. The applicant will still have to face trial and prove his innocence.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application made under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code in connection with Forest Crime No. 47009/01, which was registered at Police Station Forest Range Rukhad Distt. Seoni for the offence under Sections 2, 9, 39, 48A, 49B, 50, 51, 52 and 57 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the committal/trial Court to appear before the court on the dates given by the concerned Court. The grant of bail is subject to certain conditions, and the purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person appears before the court on the dates given by the concerned court. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is not a final decision on the merits of the case, and the applicant will still have to face trial and prove his innocence.
