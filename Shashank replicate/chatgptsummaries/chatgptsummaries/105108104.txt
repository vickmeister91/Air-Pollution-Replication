The court order pertains to a criminal revision case where the applicant/accused was convicted under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for possessing 85 pieces of Sambhar/Chital horns. The applicant challenged the conviction on two grounds. Firstly, he argued that the Forest Guard who conducted the search and seizure was not authorized to do so. Secondly, he contended that the prosecution failed to prove that the seized articles were really pieces of the horns of Sambhar/Chital.

The court examined both these contentions and found them to be without merit. The court held that the Forest Guard was a Forest Officer and had the authority to conduct the search and seizure. The court also found that the prosecution had provided sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. Therefore, the court upheld the conviction and sentence.

The court also addressed the issue of the authority of forest officers to seize animal articles. The defense had argued that the prosecution failed to prove that the seized articles were pieces of horns of Sambhar/Chital and that they were not sent for chemical examination. However, the court found no substantial contradiction in the prosecution's statement and affirmed the findings of guilt under Section 44 read with Section 51 of the Act of 1972.

The sentence of fine was enhanced to Rs. 3000/- or six months of imprisonment in default of payment. The applicant/accused, who is a poor villager and aged about 60 years, had already undergone one month of imprisonment. The court decided that no useful purpose would be served in sending him back to jail. Therefore, the court awarded a sentence for the period already undergone by him for the offense. The criminal revision was partly allowed.

In conclusion, the court order upholds the conviction and sentence of the accused for possessing 85 pieces of Sambhar/Chital horns. The court found that the Forest Guard who conducted the search and seizure was authorized to do so and that the prosecution had provided sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused. The court also affirmed the authority of forest officers to seize animal articles. The sentence of fine was enhanced, but the court awarded a sentence for the period already undergone by the accused.
