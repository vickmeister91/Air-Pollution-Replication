The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Surender Pal against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The Bhartiya Kisan Sangh had filed a PIL earlier, and the case was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders, directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances into the canal and remove platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to check the standard of water. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court also directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found throwing garbage/solid waste in the canal.

The court order directs the state to take steps for the construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. It also imposes a compensation of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating distributory or canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this through notices. The compliance report regarding publication of such notices and action taken by the state/local authorities must be placed before the court on the next date of hearing. The court also directs the District Collector to be present with all relevant records on the next date of hearing. The state is further directed to remove all encroachments within one month and issue show cause notices to those causing pollution. The state must comply with the directions in letter and spirit, or appropriate action will be taken.

The National Green Tribunal has issued multiple orders directing the state government to comply with directions to remove encroachments and structures that are causing contamination of canal water. The state government has been ordered to file compliance reports and issue notices to those contributing to pollution and encroachment. However, the government's actions have been deemed inadequate, and the District Collector has been directed to appear before the Tribunal. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over civil cases involving environmental issues, and those aggrieved by the government's actions are advised to approach the Tribunal.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedies under the Act of 2010 and how it does not bar writ jurisdiction. The court emphasizes the importance of fundamental and constitutional rights and the discretion given to High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue writs, orders, and directions to protect these rights. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching a writ court, but notes that this principle can be deviated from in certain circumstances. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action until December 31, 2016.

The court has ordered that an application or representation must be filed by December 31, 2016, in relation to cases 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Until that date, the state authorities are not allowed to take any action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone any delay in filing the application/representation and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition being pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed according to further orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition has been disposed of.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The National Green Tribunal passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances into the canal and remove platforms raised on the canal.
