The court order in question pertains to a petition for a writ of mandamus filed by Iqbal Singh against the State of Punjab and others. Singh had requested a direction against respondents No.1 to 5 to take action for closure of a Pottery Unit being run by respondent No. 6 from a residential premises in Ward No. 12, Kharar, in the district of Mohali. Singh's case was that the Pottery Unit was causing pollution and nuisance to the residents of the area.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the competent authorities, i.e. Municipal Council, Kharar and the Punjab Pollution Control Board, Patiala, to look into the matter and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law. The authorities were directed not to pass any order against respondent No.6 without serving upon him a proper notice and affording him a full and reasonable opportunity of being heard in the matter.
