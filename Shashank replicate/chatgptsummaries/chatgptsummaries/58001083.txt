The court order pertains to multiple criminal cases in Meghalaya, with the main case involving a petitioner who owns a truck that was seized by the police for transporting coal illegally. The petitioner filed a Zimma application to release the truck, but the Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected it. The petitioner argued that the retention of the vehicle would result in undue financial loss and that the condition imposed by the National Green Tribunal was harsh. The Advocate General supported the trial magistrate's decision. The court disposed of all related cases as the legal issues were identical.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a trial magistrate/criminal court has the jurisdiction to decline a Zimma application filed by petitioners for the release of seized vehicles. The court examines Section 451 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which enables the court to pass an order for interim custody of property pending conclusion of enquiry or trial. The court concludes that the magistrate/criminal court has failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 451 CrPC and that the circular dated 31.01.2019 issued by the office of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Meghalaya and Head of Forest Force shall be ineffective while adjudicating petitions under Section 451 CrPC. The court allows the petitions and remands the matters back to the trial magistrate/criminal court to pass a fresh order in accordance with law.

The court has ordered the trial Magistrate/Criminal Court to pass a fresh order based on the principles and guidelines mentioned in the case. Criminal Reference No.1 of 2019 has also been answered accordingly. In Crl.Petn.No.19 of 2019, the petitioner has not filed any application for release of the vehicle on Zimma under Section 451 CrPC. The revision petition is disposed of by allowing the petitioner to approach the trial Magistrate for release of the vehicle under Section 451 CrPC, who shall pass an appropriate order based on the legal proposition mentioned in the case. The order was given on July 12, 2019, by Chief Justice Ajay Kumar Mittal.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of trial magistrates/criminal courts in declining Zimma applications filed by petitioners for the release of seized vehicles. The court has emphasized the importance of exercising jurisdiction under Section 451 CrPC and has declared the circular dated 31.01.2019 issued by the office of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Meghalaya and Head of Forest Force as ineffective while adjudicating petitions under Section 451 CrPC. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the release of seized vehicles in Meghalaya.
