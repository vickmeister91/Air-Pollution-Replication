The Delhi High Court recently passed an order in a case where the petitioner had filed a petition seeking directions to de-seal his premises, which had been sealed by the respondent No.1/NDMC on the directions of the Monitoring Committee. The petitioner also sought quashing/setting aside of the order passed by the Monitoring Committee. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to inform the respondent No.1/NDMC about the order passed in the execution petition, which stated that the petitioner was ready and willing to receive possession of the premises in its present condition, i.e., on an "as is where is basis". The court also noted that the premises had been found vacant during an inspection conducted by an officer of the respondent No.1/NDMC.

The court further noted that before an order is passed against a person that entails civil consequences, a notice to show cause is necessarily envisaged under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The court concluded that the order passed by the Monitoring Committee without granting a hearing to the petitioner cannot be sustained and allowed the petition subject to certain conditions.

The court directed the respondents to afford an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner before passing any re-sealing order. The court order states that the petitioner failed to inform the NDMC about the execution petition and the change of status of the premises, which led to the petitioner occupying the premises without permission. The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any document to show that he had obtained the necessary permission to occupy the premises.

The court observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to comply with the orders passed by the Monitoring Committee and had instead chosen to file a petition seeking de-sealing of the premises. The court noted that the petitioner had not even filed an application for modification of the order passed by the Monitoring Committee.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to comply with the orders passed by the court in the earlier proceedings. The court noted that the petitioner had not even filed an application for modification of the order passed by the court.

The court directed the petitioner to file an undertaking that he would comply with the orders passed by the Monitoring Committee and the court. The court also directed the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs as a security deposit with the respondent No.1/NDMC.

The court observed that the petitioner had not produced any document to show that he had obtained the necessary permission to occupy the premises. The court directed the petitioner to produce the necessary documents before the respondent No.1/NDMC within a period of two weeks from the date of the order.

The court also directed the respondent No.1/NDMC to inspect the premises within a period of two weeks from the date of the order and submit a report to the court. The court directed the respondent No.1/NDMC to de-seal the premises if it is found that the petitioner has complied with the orders passed by the Monitoring Committee and the court.
