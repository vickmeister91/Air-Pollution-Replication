The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner to summon the General Manager of Tirunelveli District Central Co-Operative Bank and the President of the Primary Agricultural Co-Operative Credit Society. The petitioner's aim was to establish the fact that the instrument in question was a cheque. However, the Court dismissed the petition on the ground that the instrument in question was not given by the said Bank.

Despite the dismissal of the petition, the petitioner persisted in their efforts to establish the nature of the negotiable instrument. The Court allowed the petitioner to examine the General Manager of the Tirunelveli District Central Co-Operative Bank, but only for the purpose of establishing the nature of the negotiable instrument.

The Court directed the Judicial Magistrate, Vallioor to dispose of the case within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. This means that the case must be resolved within a month, and the Judicial Magistrate is responsible for ensuring that this happens.

It is important to note that the Court's decision to allow the petitioner to examine the General Manager of the Tirunelveli District Central Co-Operative Bank was not a guarantee that the instrument in question was a cheque. Rather, it was simply a means of establishing the nature of the negotiable instrument.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case was to dismiss the petitioner's initial petition on the grounds that the instrument in question was not given by the said Bank. However, the Court did allow the petitioner to examine the General Manager of the Tirunelveli District Central Co-Operative Bank for the purpose of establishing the nature of the negotiable instrument. The Court also directed the Judicial Magistrate, Vallioor to dispose of the case within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
