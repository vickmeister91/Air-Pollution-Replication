The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate-II, Fast Track Court at Coimbatore in C.M.P.No.1365 of 2016 in C.C.No.303 of 2015. The petitioner requested that the Respondent/Complainant be directed to produce the document of Pan card Xerox copy and Income Tax Return of 2011-2012. The petitioner is currently facing prosecution in C.M.P.No.1365 of 2016 in C.C.No.303 of 2015 before the Judicial Magistrate-II, Fast Track Court at Coimbatore.

The Trial Court dismissed the petition, prompting the petitioner to challenge the decision. The High Court subsequently dismissed the petition, stating that the complainant's Income Tax Returns were not relevant to the case.

The petitioner's argument for requesting the production of the complainant's Income Tax Returns was not clearly stated in the court order summaries. However, it can be inferred that the petitioner believed that the complainant's Income Tax Returns were relevant to the case and could potentially help their defense.

The High Court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the complainant's Income Tax Returns were not relevant to the case. It is unclear from the court order summaries why the complainant's Income Tax Returns were deemed irrelevant.

Overall, the court order summaries provide limited information about the case and the reasoning behind the decisions made by the Trial Court and the High Court. It is difficult to fully understand the context and implications of the case without additional information.
