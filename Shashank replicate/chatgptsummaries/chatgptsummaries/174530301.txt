The Supreme Court of India has issued a court order pertaining to the management and conservation of wetlands covered under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. The court has directed the concerned High Courts to monitor the management of these sites until there is visible improvement. Pursuant to this, an affidavit was registered as a writ petition titled "Court on its own Motion" in the public interest. The court was informed that the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017 are applicable in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and that 1230 wetlands have been identified as covered under these rules. The Rules postulate the creation of a regulatory body called "The State Wetlands Authority."

The court order establishes the formation of State and Union Territory Wetlands Authorities, with specific members appointed to each. These authorities are responsible for identifying and regulating wetlands within their jurisdiction, preparing lists of wetlands to be notified, developing strategies for conservation and wise use of wetlands, and enforcing relevant Acts, rules, and regulations. They are also tasked with coordinating with other agencies and departments to implement integrated management plans for wetlands.

The court order directs the creation of a Wetland Authority to coordinate the implementation of integrated management plans for wetlands, issue necessary conservation and management directions, and enhance awareness within stakeholders and local communities. The concerned department of the State Government or Union Territory shall provide necessary support and act as nodal department and secretariat to the Authority. The Authority shall constitute a technical committee and a grievance committee, and meetings shall be held at least once every quarter. The Union of India through the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is directed to be impleaded as a party respondent. The importance of preservation and maintenance of wetlands is emphasized, including those covered under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and those identified by the State Government. The petition is to be listed along with another similar petition on September 26, 2018.

The court order is a significant step towards the conservation and management of wetlands in India. Wetlands are critical ecosystems that provide a range of ecological, economic, and social benefits. They are home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, and provide important ecosystem services such as water purification, flood control, and carbon sequestration. However, wetlands are under threat from a range of human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and industrialization. The court order recognizes the importance of wetlands and the need for their conservation and management.

The formation of State and Union Territory Wetlands Authorities is a key aspect of the court order. These authorities will be responsible for identifying and regulating wetlands within their jurisdiction, preparing lists of wetlands to be notified, developing strategies for conservation and wise use of wetlands, and enforcing relevant Acts, rules, and regulations. This will help to ensure that wetlands are managed in a coordinated and integrated manner, and that their ecological, economic, and social benefits are maximized.

The creation of a Wetland Authority is another important aspect of the court order. This authority will be responsible for coordinating the implementation of integrated management plans for wetlands, issuing necessary conservation and management directions, and enhancing awareness within stakeholders and local communities. The technical committee and grievance committee will provide technical expertise and address grievances related to wetland management. The involvement of the Union of India through the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is also significant, as it will help to ensure that wetland management is integrated with national policies and programs.

The court order emphasizes the importance of preservation and maintenance of wetlands, including those covered under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and those identified by the State Government. The Ramsar Convention is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands, and India is a signatory to the convention. The identification of wetlands by the State Government is also important, as it will help to ensure that all wetlands within the jurisdiction of the State are managed and conserved.

In conclusion, the court order is a significant step towards the conservation and management of wetlands in India. The formation of State and Union Territory Wetlands Authorities and the creation of a Wetland Authority will help to ensure that wetlands are managed in a coordinated and integrated manner, and that their ecological, economic, and social benefits are maximized. The involvement of the Union of India through the Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change is also significant, as it will help to ensure that wetland management is integrated with national policies and programs. The court order emphasizes the importance of preservation and maintenance of wetlands, including those covered under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and those identified by the State Government.
