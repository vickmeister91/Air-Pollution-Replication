The court order pertains to two separate cases involving the appointment and seniority of Junior Engineers (J.E.) in the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board and Senior Health Inspectors. In the first case, the petitioner, who was appointed as J.E. through direct recruitment, challenged the seniority of a J.E. appointed on deputation from the Panchayat Raj Department. The court found that the appointment of the deputationist was illegal as it did not conform to the statutory rules. Even if it was assumed to be valid, the deputationist could not be given seniority above the petitioner. The court also noted that a deputationist cannot claim seniority above those already working in the same cadre in the department where they are deputed.

In the second case, the court discusses the issue of deputationists being absorbed into the posts of Senior Health Inspectors and the violation of statutory provisions. The court concludes that deputationists cannot claim seniority in the department where they are deputed over and above those who were already working there. The court also discusses previous cases and their relevance to the present case.

In both cases, the court emphasizes the importance of following statutory rules and regulations in appointments and promotions. The court notes that deputationists cannot be given seniority above those who were already working in the same cadre in the department where they are deputed. The court also emphasizes that deputationists cannot claim seniority over those who were appointed through direct recruitment.

In the first case, the court orders appropriate seniority for the petitioner above the deputationist. In the second case, the court allows the writ petition and orders appropriate seniority for the petitioner above the deputationist, but does not require the deputationist to refund benefits received. The petitioner is entitled to all consequential benefits resulting from the seniority.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following statutory rules and regulations in appointments and promotions. It also emphasizes that deputationists cannot claim seniority above those who were already working in the same cadre in the department where they are deputed. The court's decision in both cases ensures that appointments and promotions are made in a fair and transparent manner, and that those who are appointed through direct recruitment are not disadvantaged in any way.
