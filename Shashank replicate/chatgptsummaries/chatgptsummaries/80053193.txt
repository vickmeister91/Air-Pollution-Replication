In a recent court order, a challenge to an order that summoned the Principal of a school to examine the admission register of a minor prosecutrix in a case was dismissed. The petitioner argued that only witnesses can be called under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. and not documents. However, the court held that it has the power to call for documents if essential for the better disposal of the case under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The court also noted that the prosecution had not filed the required documents to ascertain the age of the prosecutrix. This is an important point as the age of the prosecutrix is crucial in determining the nature of the crime and the punishment that should be meted out to the accused. The court's decision to summon the Principal of the school to examine the admission register is therefore justified as it is necessary to ascertain the age of the prosecutrix.

The court's decision is also in line with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. which give the court the power to call for documents if they are essential for the better disposal of the case. This power is given to the court to ensure that justice is done and that the accused is not wrongly convicted or punished.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of proper documentation in criminal cases. The prosecution has a duty to file all the necessary documents to ensure that the case is properly investigated and that justice is done. In this case, the prosecution's failure to file the required documents has led to the court summoning the Principal of the school to examine the admission register.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the challenge to the order that summoned the Principal of the school to examine the admission register of a minor prosecutrix in a case is justified. The court has the power to call for documents if they are essential for the better disposal of the case under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The prosecution's failure to file the required documents to ascertain the age of the prosecutrix has led to the court summoning the Principal of the school to examine the admission register. This case highlights the importance of proper documentation in criminal cases and the duty of the prosecution to file all the necessary documents to ensure that justice is done.
