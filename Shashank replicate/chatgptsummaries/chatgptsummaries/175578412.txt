Three court orders have been summarized in this task. The first court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Smt. Veena Luthra against Sh. Chander Mohan Badoni under section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. The petitioner claims that the tenanted premises were let out to the respondent on a monthly rent of Rs. 2200 and that she needs the premises for her son's business. The respondent has filed a leave to defend application, contending that the petitioner is not the owner of the premises and that the petitioner has no bonafide requirement of the tenanted premises. The court finds that the petitioner is the owner of the premises and that the respondent has no right to question the ownership. The court also finds that the respondent has not provided any evidence to support his claim that he was threatened to vacate the premises. The court orders that the respondent's leave to defend application be dismissed.

The second court order states that the petitioner is the owner of the suit property and the respondent, being a tenant, has no right to question the ownership. The court also dismisses the respondent's claim that the petitioner has sufficient accommodation and commercial properties to run the business. The court finds that the petitioner has a bonafide need for the tenanted premises and is entitled to an eviction order against the respondent. The order will not be executable until six months from the date of the order.

The third court order states that a file should be consigned to the record room within months from the date of the announcement in open court, which was on September 8th, 2011. The case number is CCJ-cum-ARC (Central) THC: DELHI E-02/2010.

In the first court order, Smt. Veena Luthra filed an eviction petition against Sh. Chander Mohan Badoni under section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. The petitioner claimed that the tenanted premises were let out to the respondent on a monthly rent of Rs. 2200 and that she needed the premises for her son's business. The respondent filed a leave to defend application, contending that the petitioner was not the owner of the premises and that the petitioner had no bonafide requirement of the tenanted premises. However, the court found that the petitioner was the owner of the premises and that the respondent had no right to question the ownership. The court also found that the respondent had not provided any evidence to support his claim that he was threatened to vacate the premises. Therefore, the court ordered that the respondent's leave to defend application be dismissed.

In the second court order, the petitioner was again found to be the owner of the suit property and the respondent, being a tenant, had no right to question the ownership. The respondent's claim that the petitioner had sufficient accommodation and commercial properties to run the business was dismissed by the court. The court found that the petitioner had a bonafide need for the tenanted premises and was entitled to an eviction order against the respondent. However, the order would not be executable until six months from the date of the order.

The third court order was a simple direction to consign a file to the record room within months from the date of the announcement in open court, which was on September 8th, 2011. The case number was CCJ-cum-ARC (Central) THC: DELHI E-02/2010.

In both cases, the petitioner was found to be the owner of the property and had a bonafide need for the tenanted premises. The respondent's claims were dismissed, and the court ordered eviction of the respondent. However, in the second court order, the eviction order was not executable until six months from the date of the order. The third court order was a simple direction to consign a file to the record room.
