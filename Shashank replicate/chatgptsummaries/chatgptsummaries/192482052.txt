The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to environmental violations committed by the North Chennai Thermal Power Station in Tamil Nadu, India. The violations include the illegal dumping of ash, failure to comply with environmental laws, and contamination of water and soil with heavy metals. The court orders seek to address these violations and ensure compliance with environmental laws.

One of the court orders pertains to three writ petitions filed against the National Chennai Thermal Power Station for causing environmental pollution by violating various provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,1981, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the various conditions imposed on them while granting consent to establish and operate. The petitions seek the removal of illegally dumped ash, restoration of the area to its previous state, and closure of the thermal power plant for operating in violation of environmental laws. The court disposed of all three petitions with a common order.

Another court order pertains to allegations of violations committed by the North Chennai Thermal Power Station by discharging bottom ash and fly ash in its unlined ash pond, located at Ennore and Puzhudhivakam villages. The petitioner has contended that the second respondent has not complied with fly-ash Notification and has not achieved 100% fly ash utilization. The court has directed the respondents to remove and evacuate the ash illegally dumped by the second respondent, restore the area to its previous pristine state, including restoration of mangroves, drainage pattern. The second part of the order pertains to a writ petition filed by a member of the Fishermen Community, seeking prosecution against the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) and North Chennai Thermal Power Station for violation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner has alleged that the Thermal plant is not operating its electrostatic precipitators and is not using air pollution control equipment, which is mandatory under law.

Another court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the President of a fishermen's cooperative society, seeking closure of the North Chennai Thermal Power Station for violating environmental laws and emitting pollutants beyond permissible limits. The petitioner has also sought prosecution of officials of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) and the power station. The court has noted that the Pollution Control Board has issued show cause notices to the power station for violating emission standards, but has failed to take action. The petitioner has also alleged that the power station has been operating without a green belt and dumping ash into the Ennore creek. The court has directed the authorities to ensure compliance with environmental laws and develop a green belt around the power station.

The court order mandates the development of a green belt with a minimum of 400 trees per hectare and at least three varieties of trees, including Eucalyptus and Subabul, at a density of 1000 trees per acre of land. The petitioner claims that the industry is operating and expanding without complying with this mandate and has filed copies of orders from the National Green Tribunal regarding pollution caused by the North Chennai Thermal Power Station. The report submitted by experts shows high contamination of heavy metals in the water, fish, and vegetables, and the petitioner is seeking an interim order to address the urgent environmental problem. The respondents argue that the pollution is not solely caused by them and propose using fly ash to make bricks for government buildings. The court is reviewing the materials available on record.

The court order states that the North Chennai Thermal Power Station is causing pollution and contaminating the water in the area with heavy metals. The respondents 2 and 3, who operate the power station, are directed to provide sufficient drinking water to nearby residents and to create a properly lined ash pond to store fly ash. They are also directed to dredge the Kosasthalaiyar Main Channel to remove fly ash and provide protection to workers who remove the fly ash. The respondents 2 and 3 are also directed to take steps to remediate the area and replace the existing ash pipeline. The court emphasizes the principle of "polluter pays" and the importance of protecting the health of current and future generations.

The court order pertains to the dumping of ash slurry into the Buckingham Canal and backwaters by a thermal power plant in North Chennai. The applicant claims that this is causing serious pollution and adversely affecting the area, including mangroves in the CRZ I. The court has ordered the closure of the power plant and immediate stoppage of ash discharge into the canal and backwater. It has also directed the respondents to clean up the canal and remove the illegally dumped ash and soil. The court has formulated terms of reference to ascertain the factual situation and remediation methods to be adopted. The order also seeks compensation for environmental harm caused and maintenance of the canal and backwaters free of contamination or pollution.

The court order discusses the impacts of fly ash leakage on flora, fauna, biodiversity, rare and endangered species, human health, and traditional land use. It also addresses the pollution of water bodies, ground water, and soil degradation. The court has constituted a committee to investigate the situation and submit a report. The committee found serious irregularities in managing the fly ash situation and noted elevated levels of toxic metals in the water samples. The court has ordered a detailed study to assess the damage caused to the environment and remedial measures to be taken.
