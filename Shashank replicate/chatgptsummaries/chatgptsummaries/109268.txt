The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ishwar Singh against the State of Haryana and others for the closure of stone crushing businesses in Naurangpur village, District Gurgaon, due to health hazards caused by air pollution and dust. The government had issued notifications in 1992 to regulate the location of stone crushers, but they were not being followed. The court restrained respondents from carrying on any stone crushing business within a 1-kilometer radius of the village abadi. The respondents argued that they had valid licenses and pollution control measures in place. The court referred to a Supreme Court order in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India (1992) 3 SCC 256, which had directed the closure of stone crushers in certain areas and the demarcation of a new "crushing zone" for their relocation. The State of Haryana had issued a notification in pursuance of this order.

The court order directs the Governor of Haryana to take immediate steps to maintain ecological balance, prevent environmental degradation, and avoid traffic and human hazards. Stone crushers that do not meet the parameters set by the Haryana Government Environment Department must be shifted to identified zones by December 8, 1992. The maximum number of stone crushers in one zone is 25 on a first-come, first-served basis. The court also discusses the importance of public interest litigation and the need for citizens to have the ability to challenge violations of public duty or constitutional provisions.

The court order discusses the concept of public interest litigation and the criteria for allowing such cases to be heard. The court must be satisfied that the information presented requires examination and that the person approaching the court has clean hands and a clean heart. The court will not allow personal grudges or political motives to be the basis for public interest litigation. The case in question involves allegations that the petitioner is using the litigation to force the respondents to purchase his land, but the court finds that the case is maintainable in public interest due to the health hazards caused by stone crushers in the area. The court also references a report on the health effects of pollution caused by stone crushers.

The court order discusses the health hazards caused by occupational and environmental pollutants, particularly in the stone crushing industry in Haryana. The court notes that despite notifications and directions from the Supreme Court, the stone crushers have not been shifted from populated areas, and the government has failed to take effective action. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and the health of citizens, and notes that fundamental rights are subject to reasonable limitations. The court also cites a report by a committee of scientists that highlights the respiratory health risks associated with stone crushing. The court ultimately rules in favor of the petitioner, ordering the respondents to shift their stone crushing business away from populated areas.

The court order states that there is evidence of man-made harm to the environment, including dangerous levels of pollution and destruction of resources. The court holds that citizens, communities, enterprises, and institutions must share responsibility for achieving a free and unpolluted environment. The court orders the closure and shifting of stone crushers to identified zones within one month, and prohibits the purchase and sale of land in those zones for the purpose of installing stone crushers. The citizens of the area are authorized to claim compensation for damages caused by pollution from the stone crushers, and an authority will be appointed to adjudicate such claims. The State of Punjab and the High Court of Himachal Pradesh are directed to take appropriate steps to address health hazards caused by stone crushers in their respective states. The petitioner is awarded costs to be shared by the private respondents.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Ishwar Singh against the State of Haryana and others for the closure of stone crushing businesses in Naurangpur village, District Gurgaon, due to health hazards caused by air pollution and dust.
