The court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Sh. Bhu Dev against the dismissal of his application under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the court of MM-06, Shahdara District, Delhi. The petition was filed after the revisionist/complainant was booked under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, on false statements made by respondent no.1. The court held that the Magistrate is not bound to direct the police to investigate a crime merely because a prayer has been made and that the option to direct the registration of a case and its investigation by the police should be exercised only where some investigation is required which is not possible for the private complainant.

The court order discusses the circumstances under which police investigation is necessary in a complaint case. If the complainant has complete details of the accused and witnesses, and no recovery or material evidence is required, then no investigation is necessary and the complaint case procedure should be followed. The court emphasizes that adding unnecessary cases to the police diary would impair their efficiency. The court also notes that the power to direct police investigation should be exercised judiciously and not in a mechanical manner. The court dismisses the revision petition and directs the trial court to record pre-summoning evidence of the complainant within one month and proceed further in accordance with the law.
