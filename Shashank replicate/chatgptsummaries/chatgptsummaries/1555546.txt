The court order in question relates to a case where the court was asked to reconsider a previous decision regarding the granting of time to pay court fees after rejecting an application for permission to sue as a pauper. The court held that once the court has lost seisin of the case and there is no document before it, it cannot grant time to pay the court-fee under Section 149, Civil P. C.

The case in question involved an application for permission to sue as a pauper. The applicant had filed an application for leave to sue in forma pauperis, which was rejected by the lower court. The applicant then filed a revision application before the higher court, seeking reconsideration of the lower court's decision.

The higher court considered the matter and held that if a bona fide application for leave to sue in forma pauperis has been filed, the court should grant time for payment of court-fees before signing the order disallowing the prayer to be allowed to sue in forma pauperis. The court allowed the revision application and set aside the lower court's order granting time for payment of court-fees.

The court's decision in this case is significant because it clarifies the procedure to be followed in cases where an application for leave to sue in forma pauperis has been rejected. The court has held that if such an application has been filed, the court should grant time for payment of court-fees before signing the order disallowing the prayer to be allowed to sue in forma pauperis.

This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person should be given a fair opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against them. By allowing time for payment of court-fees in such cases, the court ensures that the applicant is given a fair opportunity to pursue their case.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of filing a bona fide application for leave to sue in forma pauperis. Such an application should be filed in good faith and should contain all the necessary details and information required by the court. If the court is satisfied that the application is bona fide, it may grant leave to sue in forma pauperis and allow the applicant to proceed with their case without payment of court-fees.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case provides clarity on the procedure to be followed in cases where an application for leave to sue in forma pauperis has been rejected. The court has held that if such an application has been filed, the court should grant time for payment of court-fees before signing the order disallowing the prayer to be allowed to sue in forma pauperis. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and ensures that the applicant is given a fair opportunity to pursue their case.
