The court order pertains to a property dispute case between Tukaram S/O Manikappa Bandi and Hemalatha. The dispute arose over a property transaction that was initially a mortgage but later turned into a sale. The trial court ruled in favor of Tukaram, but the lower appellate court overturned the decision, citing Section 92 of the Evidence Act, which bars the plaintiff from presenting parallel evidence that contradicts the contents of a registered deed. The plaintiff appealed the decision, and the court is now considering whether the case is hit by Section 92 of the Evidence Act.

The court order delves into the scope of Section 92 of the Evidence Act, as held by the Supreme Court. The court cites two cases where the Supreme Court explained that the bar imposed by Section 92 only applies when a party seeks to rely on a document entered into between the parties. Strangers to the contract, including the prosecution in a criminal proceeding, are not barred from establishing a contemporaneous oral agreement contradicting or purporting the terms of the instrument.

The court then applies this law to the instant case, where the plaintiff admitted to the execution of a registered sale deed but claimed it was nominal, sham, and not acted upon. The court held that the plaintiff is entitled to adduce oral evidence to show that the transaction was not intended to be acted upon. The court also found that the lower appellate court erred in reversing the trial court's finding without considering its reasoning.

The court allowed the appeal and restored the trial court's judgment and decree. The court held that the plaintiff is entitled to adduce oral evidence to show that the transaction was not intended to be acted upon. The court also found that the lower appellate court erred in reversing the trial court's finding without considering its reasoning.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 92 of the Evidence Act and its applicability in cases where a party seeks to rely on a document entered into between the parties. The court's ruling also highlights the importance of considering the reasoning behind a lower court's decision before overturning it.

In conclusion, the court order in the case between Tukaram S/O Manikappa Bandi and Hemalatha clarifies the scope of Section 92 of the Evidence Act and its applicability in cases where a party seeks to rely on a document entered into between the parties. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of considering the reasoning behind a lower court's decision before overturning it.
