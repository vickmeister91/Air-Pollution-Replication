The Supreme Court of India recently heard Criminal Appeal No. 152 of 2012, along with Criminal Appeal Nos. 153-155 of 2012, in which the appellants were accused of violating norms prescribed by the Deputy Commissioner under Section 22 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The appellants allegedly established iron ore stack yards without pollution control measures, despite repeated requests and instructions given to them by the officials of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board.

The High Court of Karnataka disposed of the case by relying on an earlier order passed by the High Court on 17.04.2007, without examining the merits of the controversy. The Supreme Court examined whether the complaint under Section 43(1) of the Air Act was filed by the Board or its Chairman and concluded that the complaint could have been filed by either of them. The Court held that the proceedings initiated by the Chairman's order dated 4.4.2006 did not comply with the mandate contained in Section 43(1) of the Air Act.

The court order states that the complaint against the appellants was filed by the Regional Officer (Deputy Environmental Officer) and not by the Board or its Chairman. The Chairman of the Board had no authority to delegate the power to file complaints to any other authority. Therefore, the complaints filed by the Regional Officer are liable to be set aside on technical grounds.

The court directs the competent authority, namely, the Board (or the Chairman of the Board) to re-initiate the proceedings in consonance with the provisions of Section 43(1) of the Air Act. The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms.
