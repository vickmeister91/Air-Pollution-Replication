The High Court of Gujarat recently heard a criminal appeal against conviction in a case involving the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the Arms Act. The appellant had been found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment and a fine. The appeal was filed on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the accused and that the judgment was against the provisions of the law. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision.

The appellant argued that there was no reliable evidence to prove his guilt in the crime he was accused of, and that the recovery of the weapon was weak evidence. He also argued that he was suffering from Typhoid at the time of the crime and was not in a position to move freely. The prosecution argued that there was reliable evidence to prove the appellant's guilt and that there was no evidence to support his claim of illness. The court had to consider the evidence and arguments presented by both sides before making a decision.

In its order, the court discussed the conviction of the appellant-accused for offences under the Wild Life Act and the Arms Act. The court re-evaluated the evidence on record and found that there was no proof of the accused's presence at the scene of the crime or his involvement in the offence. The court also discussed the punishment for contravention of licence or rule under Section 30 of the Arms Act.

In another case, the court heard a case where the accused was convicted for violating Section 30 of the Arms Act, as he was found to have breached the conditions of his gun license while hunting a blue bull. However, the court found that there was no evidence to prove that the accused had not taken proper care of his firearm, and that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the court acquitted the accused and set aside the previous judgment.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of reliable evidence in criminal cases. The prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the court must evaluate the evidence presented by both sides before making a decision. In the first case, the court found that the prosecution had failed to prove the charges against the accused, while in the second case, the court found that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to support its case. 

Overall, the court's orders emphasize the need for a fair and just legal system that upholds the rule of law and protects the rights of all individuals. The court's decisions in these cases demonstrate the importance of evidence and the need for a thorough evaluation of all the facts before a verdict is reached.
