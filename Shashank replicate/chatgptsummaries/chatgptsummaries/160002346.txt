The case revolved around the violation of Rule 8 of Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 1998, which requires hospitals to obtain authorization for the disposal of biomedical waste. The petitioner hospital was alleged to have violated this rule, and as a result, was charged under Section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court found that the petitioner hospital was indeed bound to obtain authorization under the rules, and in the absence of it, the penal clause comes into play.

Failure to do so can result in serious legal consequences, as demonstrated in this case.
