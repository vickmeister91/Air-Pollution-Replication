The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various cases filed in Tamil Nadu, India, related to the cultivation and planting of Eucalyptus species for commercial purposes. The petitioners seek writs of mandamus and certiorarified mandamus to restrain the respondents from planting Eucalyptus and to quash a tender notification. The court has reserved its decision on the matter.

In one of the court orders, W.P.No.3633 of 2014, the court directs the respondents to remove wattle and eucalyptus trees grown in the forests of the Tamil Nadu region within a specified time period. The order discusses the impact of invasive species on the environment and the need to protect forests and wildlife. The court cites Article 48-A and Article 51-A(g) of the Constitution of India, which emphasize the need to improve the environment and protect forests and wildlife. The order also notes that the density of invasive species in some areas is between 65% and 75%, and there is no secondary or fresh growth of indigenous trees or plants.

Another court order discusses the issue of invasive species in certain areas where there is no secondary or fresh growth of indigenous trees or plants. The order distinguishes between "exotics" and "invasives," with the latter being defined as an alien species that can cause economic or environmental damage. The order provides examples of invasive trees, such as Wattle and Pines, and discusses their introduction and spread in India. The order also mentions invasive plants, including Lantana camara, Prosopis Juliflora, Parthenium hysterophorus, and Argemone. The negative effects of invasive species on the environment and native habitats are discussed, including their impact on water use, soil desiccation, and biodiversity.

In another court order, the issue of invasive plant species in India is discussed, specifically Lantana camara, which is spreading rapidly and causing damage to agricultural and forest lands. The order also highlights the destruction of Shola Forest and grasslands, which are important for maintaining water sources and biodiversity. The invasive species are causing a reduction in hydrological species and nutrients in the soil, leading to droughts and the possibility of the forest becoming a relic. The order calls for concerted efforts to eradicate the invasive species and restore the natural habitats.

The negative impact of invasive species on the environment, including the thinning of animal populations and the destruction of plant life, is discussed in another court order. The court orders the formation of a committee of experts to address the issue and suggests measures such as banning plastic in forest zones and increasing staff strength. The order also mentions the importance of protecting endangered species such as tigers and elephants. The court clarifies that removing invasive species does not require permission from the National Wildlife Board and suggests that the process could have economic benefits.

In another court order, the court allows for the utilization of removed species as recommended by the Basuviah Committee and emphasizes the need to protect the environment. The court quotes a previous decision that permits certain conservation and protection activities for better management of protected areas. The court appoints a Committee of Experts to develop a detailed action plan for the development of the forest with particular emphasis on exotic species and to include appropriate curriculum in textbooks to educate children about the need to preserve and develop forests.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of experts in ecology and environmental sciences to address the issue of invasive species management and biodiversity conservation in Tamil Nadu. The committee will be chaired by Prof. Cherukuri Raghavendra Babu and will submit its reports on an action plan within two months. The court has also appointed Mr. T. Mohan as amicus curiae to assist the committee and interact with lawyers well-versed in environmental law. The court has directed the committee to make suggestions on non-invasive exotic trees such as eucalyptus and the need for separate legislation in Tamil Nadu.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of protecting the environment and native habitats from invasive species. The court has ordered the removal of invasive species and the formation of committees to develop action plans for the management and conservation of forests in Tamil Nadu. The court has also emphasized the need to educate children about the importance of preserving and developing forests and has suggested measures such as banning plastic in forest zones and increasing staff strength to protect endangered species.
