The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by two individuals seeking regular bail in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The petitioners were caught by the police carrying ivory and cheetah skin, which is a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court allowed bail for petitioner No.1, who was only the driver of the auto rickshaw, on certain conditions. However, the petition for petitioner No.2 was rejected.

The court's decision to grant bail to petitioner No.1 was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that petitioner No.1 was only the driver of the auto rickshaw and had no knowledge of the illegal items being carried by the other petitioner. Secondly, the court observed that petitioner No.1 had no prior criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with prosecution witnesses. Finally, the court took into account the fact that petitioner No.1 had already spent a considerable amount of time in custody.

However, the court imposed certain conditions on petitioner No.1 in order to ensure that he did not abscond or tamper with prosecution witnesses. Firstly, petitioner No.1 was required to make himself available to the investigating agency whenever required. Secondly, he was not allowed to tamper with prosecution witnesses in any way. Finally, petitioner No.1 was required to mark his attendance every Sunday before the Madikeri police until further orders.

The court's decision to reject the petition for petitioner No.2 was based on several factors as well. Firstly, the court noted that petitioner No.2 was in possession of the illegal items and was therefore directly involved in the crime. Secondly, the court observed that petitioner No.2 had a prior criminal record and was therefore more likely to abscond or tamper with prosecution witnesses. Finally, the court took into account the seriousness of the crime and the fact that the illegal items were obtained through the killing of endangered species.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to petitioner No.1 and reject the petition for petitioner No.2 was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. While petitioner No.1 was granted bail on certain conditions, petitioner No.2 was denied bail due to the seriousness of the crime and the likelihood of absconding or tampering with prosecution witnesses. The court's decision serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating wildlife protection laws.
