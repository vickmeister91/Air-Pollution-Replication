The Indian Supreme Court has upheld the constitutional validity of sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. This rule permits the State Government to grant exemptions for the use of loudspeakers or public address systems during night hours on cultural or religious festive occasions of a limited duration not exceeding fifteen days in all during a calendar year. The court clarified that the scope of the exemption cannot be widened, and the State Government should specify in advance the number and particulars of the days on which such exemption will be operative. The exemption, when granted, shall not apply to silence zone areas. 

The court's decision came in response to a petition filed by an NGO, seeking a ban on the use of loudspeakers in religious places. The NGO argued that the use of loudspeakers violated the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, as well as the right to practice religion. The court rejected this argument, stating that the use of loudspeakers is not an absolute right and must be balanced against the right to a peaceful and healthy environment. 

The court also clarified that its verdict does not dilute its holding in Noise Pollution (V), in Re., which held that freedom from noise pollution is a part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court emphasized that the right to life includes the right to live in a pollution-free environment, and that the State has a duty to protect this right. 

The court's decision has been welcomed by many, who see it as a balanced approach to the issue of noise pollution. The court's clarification that the exemption cannot be widened and that it does not apply to silence zone areas is seen as a positive step towards protecting the right to a peaceful environment. 

However, some have criticized the decision, arguing that it does not go far enough in protecting the right to life and personal liberty. They argue that the use of loudspeakers should be banned altogether, as it is a form of noise pollution that can have serious health consequences. 

Overall, the court's decision is an important step towards balancing the right to practice religion with the right to a peaceful environment. It recognizes that the use of loudspeakers is not an absolute right and must be balanced against other fundamental rights. While some may argue that the decision does not go far enough, it is a positive step towards protecting the right to a peaceful and healthy environment.
