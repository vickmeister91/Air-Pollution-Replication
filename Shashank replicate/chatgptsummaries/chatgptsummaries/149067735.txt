In a recent criminal case, an application was filed by the defense counsel, Manoj Sharma, to recall seven prosecution witnesses. The defense argued that important facts were not elicited during the initial examination and cross-examination of the witnesses. However, the court rejected the application, stating that it was filed too late and there was no jurisdictional error in the trial court's decision.

The case in question involved a serious criminal offense, and the prosecution had presented several witnesses to support their case. During the initial examination and cross-examination of these witnesses, the defense counsel had failed to elicit certain important facts that they believed were crucial to their case. As a result, they filed an application to recall these witnesses in order to elicit the missing information.

However, the court found that the application was filed too late in the proceedings. The defense counsel had failed to raise the issue of missing information during the initial examination and cross-examination of the witnesses, and had only filed the application after the trial had concluded. The court noted that the defense counsel had ample opportunity to raise the issue during the trial, and that their failure to do so was a tactical decision on their part.

Furthermore, the court found that there was no jurisdictional error in the trial court's decision to not recall the witnesses. The trial court had considered the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, and had made a decision based on the merits of the case. The court noted that the trial court's decision was not arbitrary or capricious, and that there was no reason to believe that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the witnesses had been recalled.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the defense counsel's application for revision. The court noted that the defense counsel had failed to provide any compelling reasons for the witnesses to be recalled, and that their application was filed too late in the proceedings. The court emphasized that the trial court's decision was based on sound legal principles and that there was no reason to interfere with it.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of raising issues during the initial examination and cross-examination of witnesses. If important facts are not elicited during these stages, it may be difficult to recall witnesses later in the proceedings. Additionally, this case underscores the importance of filing applications in a timely manner and providing compelling reasons for the court to grant them. Failure to do so may result in the application being dismissed, as was the case here.
