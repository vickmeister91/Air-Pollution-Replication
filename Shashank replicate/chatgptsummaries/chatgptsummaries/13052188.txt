In a recent court case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the accused/petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for the production of the complainant's PAN Card and Income Tax Returns. However, the court rejected this application, stating that the source from which the amount was collected by the complainant and the Income Tax Returns filed by the complainant in regard to this amount were not relevant to the trial of the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The court found that the subject matter of inquiry in the trial of the complaint was limited to the dishonor of the cheque and the liability of the accused/petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court further stated that the production of the complainant's PAN Card and Income Tax Returns would not have any bearing on the case and would only serve to delay the proceedings.

The accused/petitioner had filed a Criminal Misc. Petition seeking the production of the complainant's PAN Card and Income Tax Returns, but the court dismissed the petition, stating that it was not necessary for the trial of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

This decision by the court highlights the importance of relevance and admissibility of evidence in a trial. The court has the power to reject applications for the production of evidence that is not relevant to the case at hand. This helps to ensure that the trial proceeds smoothly and efficiently, without unnecessary delays.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the accused/petitioner's application for the production of the complainant's PAN Card and Income Tax Returns in a case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was based on the fact that this evidence was not relevant to the trial of the complaint. The court's decision highlights the importance of relevance and admissibility of evidence in a trial and helps to ensure that the trial proceeds smoothly and efficiently.
