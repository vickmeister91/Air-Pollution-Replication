The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which involve questions of jurisdiction and the powers of investigating agencies. In the first case, the appellant was arrested for allegedly transporting animal skins in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The appellant argued that the Act was a self-contained code and that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) did not have jurisdiction to investigate the matter. However, the court found that the CBI was authorized to investigate the offense based on notifications issued by the Central Government and the State of Uttar Pradesh.

The court noted that while the Act provides special powers to certain officers, police officers are not excluded from investigating offenses under the Act. The court also observed that the CBI is a premier investigating agency with a mandate to investigate cases of national importance, and that its jurisdiction cannot be restricted by narrow interpretations of statutes. The court held that the CBI was authorized to investigate the offense under the Wild Life Act and dismissed the appeal.

In the second case, the court discussed the powers and duties of officers of the Enforcement Directorate under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The court noted that the Central Government can authorize officers of the Customs, Central Excise, Police, or any officer of the Central or State Government to exercise the powers and duties of the Director of Enforcement or any other officer of Enforcement under FERA.

The court also observed that a member of the Delhi Special Police Establishment cannot investigate offenses under FERA without proper authorization. However, the court found that the Central Government had issued a notification empowering the CBI to investigate the case against the appellants under the Wild Life Act and Indian Penal Code. The court held that the provisions of Section 50 of the Wild Life Act do not exclude the operation of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and therefore, the CBI has jurisdiction to investigate the offenses under the said Act.

The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the CBI was authorized to investigate the offenses under the Wild Life Act and Indian Penal Code. The court also observed that the CBI is a premier investigating agency with a mandate to investigate cases of national importance, and that its jurisdiction cannot be restricted by narrow interpretations of statutes.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of giving investigating agencies the necessary powers and jurisdiction to effectively investigate and prosecute offenses. The court also noted that the CBI is a premier investigating agency with a mandate to investigate cases of national importance, and that its jurisdiction cannot be restricted by narrow interpretations of statutes.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of ensuring that investigating agencies have the necessary powers and jurisdiction to effectively investigate and prosecute offenses. The court also emphasizes the need for a broad interpretation of statutes to ensure that investigating agencies are not unduly restricted in their mandate to investigate cases of national importance.
