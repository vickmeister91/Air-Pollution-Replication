The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Revision Application that was filed against an interlocutory order that refused to allow the production of documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The court, however, held that such an application cannot be entertained and advised the petitioner to convert the petition into a Criminal Misc. Application and withdraw it without a decision on merits.

The court order further stated that the petition is disposed of with liberty to the petitioner to act on the advice given by the counsel. This means that the petitioner is free to follow the advice given by their legal counsel and convert the petition into a Criminal Misc. Application. The counsel is also given the liberty to institute a fresh petition if permissible under the law.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the difference between a Criminal Revision Application and a Criminal Misc. Application. A Criminal Revision Application is filed before a higher court against an order passed by a lower court. The purpose of such an application is to challenge the legality or correctness of the lower court's order. On the other hand, a Criminal Misc. Application is filed for any other relief that is not covered under a Criminal Revision Application.

In this case, the petitioner had filed a Criminal Revision Application against an interlocutory order that refused to allow the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

The court, however, held that a Criminal Revision Application cannot be entertained against an interlocutory order refusing to allow the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. This means that the petitioner cannot challenge the legality or correctness of the lower court's order through a Criminal Revision Application.

Instead, the court advised the petitioner to convert the petition into a Criminal Misc. Application and withdraw it without a decision on merits. This means that the petitioner can file a fresh application for any other relief that is not covered under a Criminal Revision Application. The court also gave the petitioner the liberty to act on the advice given by their legal counsel and convert the petition into a Criminal Misc. Application.

The counsel was also given the liberty to institute a fresh petition if permissible under the law. This means that the counsel can file a fresh application if there are grounds for doing so and if it is permissible under the law.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a Criminal Revision Application that was filed against an interlocutory order refusing to allow the production of documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court held that such an application cannot be entertained and advised the petitioner to convert the petition into a Criminal Misc. Application and withdraw it without a decision on merits. The petitioner is free to act on the advice given by their legal counsel and the counsel is also given the liberty to file a fresh application if permissible under the law.
