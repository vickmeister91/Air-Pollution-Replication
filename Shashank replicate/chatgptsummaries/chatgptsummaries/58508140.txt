Two court orders were issued in relation to compensation claims for injuries caused by wild animals in India. The first case involved a petitioner named Uttam Sitaram Kose who was attacked by a wild boar while working in his field and suffered injuries. Kose claimed compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- in accordance with a government resolution, but it was denied. The court found the Forest Department's stand that the petitioner did not suffer any grievous injury to be incomprehensible and cited previous court decisions to support the petitioner's claim for compensation. The court made the rule returnable forthwith and heard the case by consent of the parties. The court ultimately ruled in favor of Kose and ordered the Forest Department to pay him the compensation he had claimed.

The second case involved a petitioner who was attacked by a tiger and claimed compensation of Rs.1,00,000/-. The court denied the petitioner's claim for compensation for serious injuries caused by the tiger attack, stating that the definition of "serious injury" was not defined in the government resolution. However, the court ruled that the petitioner was entitled to compensation under the government resolution dated 02.07.2010, which provides for compensation for loss caused by wild animals. The court ordered the respondents to pay the petitioner Rs.1,00,000/- with interest at 6% per annum within three months. No costs were awarded.

In both cases, the court was tasked with determining whether the petitioners were entitled to compensation for injuries caused by wild animals. In the first case, the court found that Kose had suffered a grievous injury and was entitled to compensation under the government resolution. The court cited previous court decisions to support its ruling and found the Forest Department's argument that Kose had not suffered a grievous injury to be incomprehensible. The court ultimately ordered the Forest Department to pay Kose the compensation he had claimed.

In the second case, the court denied the petitioner's claim for compensation for serious injuries caused by a tiger attack, stating that the definition of "serious injury" was not defined in the government resolution. However, the court found that the petitioner was entitled to compensation under the government resolution dated 02.07.2010, which provides for compensation for loss caused by wild animals. The court ordered the respondents to pay the petitioner Rs.1,00,000/- with interest at 6% per annum within three months. No costs were awarded.

These two cases highlight the importance of having clear definitions and guidelines in government resolutions related to compensation for injuries caused by wild animals. In the absence of clear definitions, courts are left to interpret the resolution and determine whether a petitioner is entitled to compensation. In both cases, the court had to rely on previous court decisions and its own interpretation of the government resolution to make its ruling.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of having clear guidelines and definitions in government resolutions related to compensation for injuries caused by wild animals. Without clear guidelines, petitioners may be left without compensation for injuries suffered due to the actions of wild animals.
