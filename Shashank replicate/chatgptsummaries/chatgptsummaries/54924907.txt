In a recent case, three applicants were granted bail by the court after being charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for possessing rare snakes with two heads. The prosecution alleged that the applicants were looking for buyers for the snakes, which were recovered by the Special Task Force. However, the court noted that the case was triable by a lower court and that the investigating agency had not provided the criminal antecedents of the applicants.

The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond and a local solvent surety. This decision was made after considering various factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trade of certain species of animals and plants. The possession of rare and endangered species is also illegal under this law.

In this case, the accused were found in possession of rare snakes with two heads, which are considered to be a valuable commodity in the illegal wildlife trade. The prosecution alleged that the accused were looking for buyers for these snakes, which were recovered by the Special Task Force.

However, the court noted that the case was triable by a lower court and that the investigating agency had not provided the criminal antecedents of the accused. This means that the court did not have enough evidence to prove that the accused were involved in the illegal wildlife trade.

The court also considered various other factors before granting bail to the accused. These factors included the nature of the offense, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.

The nature of the offense in this case was possession of rare snakes with two heads, which is a non-violent offense. The evidence against the accused was also not strong enough to prove their involvement in the illegal wildlife trade. Finally, the court found that there was no likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.

Based on these factors, the court granted bail to the accused and directed them to furnish a personal bond and a local solvent surety. This means that the accused will be released from custody, but they will have to provide a guarantee that they will appear in court when required.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to three applicants who were charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for possessing rare snakes with two heads. The court noted that the case was triable by a lower court and that the investigating agency had not provided the criminal antecedents of the accused. The court allowed the bail application and directed the accused to furnish a personal bond and a local solvent surety. This decision was made after considering various factors, including the nature of the offense, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.
