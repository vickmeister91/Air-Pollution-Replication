The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by three petitioners in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleges that the petitioners drove pegs in a field, stretched GI wire along those pegs, and released stolen electricity from the electric line in those wires, which resulted in the electrocution of a person and a blue bull. The petitioners were arrested in respect of the person's death and released on bail. Later, a separate offence was registered in respect of the blue bull's death.

The court, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners on the condition that they furnish a personal bond and a solvent surety each in the sum of Rs. 40,000 and appear before the trial court on all dates and comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of the Cr.P.C.
