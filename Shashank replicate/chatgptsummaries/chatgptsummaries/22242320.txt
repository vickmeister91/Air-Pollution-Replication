The Wild Life (Protection) Act is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants. Violation of the act can result in imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Rajkumar Yadav was accused of violating the act. However, the court found no direct or circumstantial evidence against him. The court believed that no custodial interrogation was necessary, which means that Yadav did not need to be arrested and taken into custody for questioning.

Instead, the court granted anticipatory bail to Yadav. Anticipatory bail is a type of bail that is granted before a person is arrested. It is granted to a person who anticipates arrest in a non-bailable offense. In this case, Yadav was granted anticipatory bail because he was accused of violating a non-bailable offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

The court directed Yadav to cooperate with the investigation and trial. This means that Yadav must provide any information or evidence that is requested by the investigating officer or the court. Yadav must also attend all court hearings related to the case.

In addition, the court imposed certain conditions on Yadav. Yadav must provide a personal bond of Rs. 50,000, which means that he must pay a certain amount of money as a guarantee that he will comply with the conditions of the bail. If Yadav fails to comply with the conditions, he may forfeit the bond.

Yadav is also not allowed to leave India without permission from the trial court or investigating officer. This means that Yadav cannot travel outside of India without first obtaining permission from the court or the investigating officer. If Yadav leaves India without permission, he may be in violation of the conditions of the bail.

The court order was sent to the concerned Station House Officer for compliance. The Station House Officer is a police officer who is in charge of a police station. The order was sent to the Station House Officer to ensure that the conditions of the bail are enforced.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Rajkumar Yadav, who was accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court found no direct or circumstantial evidence against Yadav and believed that no custodial interrogation was necessary. Yadav must cooperate with the investigation and trial, and comply with certain conditions, including a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and not leaving India without permission from the trial court or investigating officer. The order was sent to the concerned Station House Officer for compliance.
