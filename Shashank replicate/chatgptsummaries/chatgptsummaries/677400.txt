The Calcutta High Court recently heard a case where two residents had filed a complaint about air and noise pollution caused by a nearby showroom. The Pollution Control Board had issued an order for the showroom to close its air conditioning machines, but the Appellate Authority later overturned this decision after entertaining a review petition. The court examined whether the Appellate Authority had the power to review its own orders and found that the relevant statute did not confer this power. The court also noted that the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act did confer this power, but this did not apply to the State Appellate Authority in question. The court cited previous judgments to support its finding that an authority cannot review its own orders in the absence of an express statutory provision.

The court found that the power of review must be expressly conferred by the statute in order to be exercised by a statutory authority acting as an inferior tribunal and discharging quasi-judicial functions. The court quashed an order of review passed by the Director as ultra vires and without jurisdiction. The court also quashed a clause in the Practice Direction that allowed the Appellate Authority to exercise its power of review. The court revived an earlier order and expected the respondent to act in terms of that order. There was no order as to costs.

The court's decision was based on the principle that an authority cannot review its own orders in the absence of an express statutory provision.

It underscores the importance of ensuring that the power of review is expressly conferred by the statute in order to avoid any ambiguity or confusion about the authority's ability to review its own orders. The court's decision also highlights the need for clarity and precision in the drafting of statutes and regulations governing the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by statutory authorities.
