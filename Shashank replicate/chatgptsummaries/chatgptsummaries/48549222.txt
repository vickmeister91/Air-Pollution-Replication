In a recent court order, the petitioner's application to re-summon two witnesses was allowed by the court. The court cited a previous judgment that stated that recalling a witness for cross-examination is necessary to protect the fairness of the trial. The court set aside the previous order and ordered the court to summon the witnesses for cross-examination subject to payment of costs of Rs.5,000/- each payable to two witnesses. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw a sum of Rs.10,000/- deposited with the Registry.

The court's decision was based on the principle of fairness in trial proceedings. The court recognized that the petitioner had a right to cross-examine the witnesses and that the previous order had denied the petitioner this right. The court also recognized that the witnesses had been inconvenienced by the previous order and that they should be compensated for their time and effort.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to re-summon the witnesses was also based on the fact that the witnesses had important information that was relevant to the case. The court recognized that the witnesses' testimony could have a significant impact on the outcome of the trial and that it was important for the petitioner to have the opportunity to cross-examine them.

The court's decision to order the payment of costs to the witnesses was also based on the principle of fairness. The court recognized that the witnesses had been inconvenienced by the previous order and that they should be compensated for their time and effort. The court also recognized that the payment of costs would help to ensure that witnesses are willing to testify in future cases.

Overall, the court's decision was a fair and just one. It recognized the importance of cross-examination in trial proceedings and ensured that the petitioner had the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. It also recognized the inconvenience caused to the witnesses and ordered the payment of costs to compensate them for their time and effort. The court's decision will help to ensure that trial proceedings are fair and just for all parties involved.
