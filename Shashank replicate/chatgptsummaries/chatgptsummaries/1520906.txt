The court order in question pertains to a tax assessment of Orient Paper and Industries Ltd. for the assessment year 1984-85. The court was asked to provide an opinion on two questions referred by the Tribunal. The first question was related to expenses on repairs and insurance for motor cars, which the court upheld as not disallowable under Section 37(3A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The second question was related to unpaid amounts under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, and under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977.

The court found that the amount payable under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, was not hit by the provisions of Section 43B of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Section 43B of the Income-tax Act, 1961, deals with certain deductions that are allowed only on actual payment of the amount. However, the unpaid cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was covered by Section 43B. This means that the unpaid cess cannot be claimed as a deduction unless it has been paid.

The court's decision on the first question related to expenses on repairs and insurance for motor cars was based on Section 37(3A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. This section deals with expenses that are not deductible in computing the income chargeable under the head "profits and gains of business or profession." The court held that the expenses on repairs and insurance for motor cars were not disallowable under this section.

The court's decision on the second question related to unpaid amounts under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, and under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Cement (Control) Order, 1967, was enacted to regulate the supply and distribution of cement in the country. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries.

The court found that the amount payable under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, was not hit by the provisions of Section 43B of the Income-tax Act, 1961. This means that the amount payable under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, can be claimed as a deduction even if it has not been paid. However, the unpaid cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was covered by Section 43B. This means that the unpaid cess cannot be claimed as a deduction unless it has been paid.

In conclusion, the court order in question provides clarity on the deductibility of expenses on repairs and insurance for motor cars and the treatment of unpaid amounts under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, and under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court held that expenses on repairs and insurance for motor cars are not disallowable under Section 37(3A) of the Income-tax Act, 1961. The court also held that the amount payable under the Cement (Control) Order, 1967, can be claimed as a deduction even if it has not been paid, but the unpaid cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, cannot be claimed as a deduction unless it has been paid.
