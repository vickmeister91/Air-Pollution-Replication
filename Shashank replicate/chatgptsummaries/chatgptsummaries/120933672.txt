The court heard several writ petitions related to the grant of a mining lease for Manganese Ore to Maruti Minerals & Metals. The petitioner had applied for a mining lease, which was approved by the Central Government, subject to certain conditions. However, the State Government did not actuate the lease deed due to objections raised by respondents. The court was asked to quash and set aside the impugned notification and order and direct the respondent to complete the formality of execution of the mining lease in favor of the petitioner. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

Another dispute discussed in the court order was related to the reservation of an area for mining of Manganese Ore exclusively for a government-owned corporation, GMDC. The petitioner, who had obtained approval and a lease for mining in the same area, argues that subsequent notifications and approvals do not affect their legal rights. The petitioner also challenges the Mining Policy and subsequent notifications as arbitrary and violative of their constitutional rights. The respondents argue that the petitioner has no legal right as no sale deed was executed, and the reservation of the area for GMDC is a policy decision taken in the public interest. The court was asked to decide whether the petitioner has a legal right and whether the reservation of the area for GMDC is arbitrary or a valid policy decision.

The court also discussed a dispute over the reservation of an area for mining of manganese ore in Gujarat, India. The petitioner argues that the reservation of the area for a public sector undertaking is unconstitutional and that they were given a work permit to dump waste materials after excavation. The respondent argues that the reservation is a legislative function and that the petitioner has no technical expertise for mining. The court examines relevant laws and provisions and ultimately upholds the reservation of the area for the public sector undertaking. The court also discusses the doctrine of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel in relation to government policy changes.

The court order also discusses the reservation of areas for prospecting or mining operations of minerals by the State Government under Section 17-A of the Act. The court finds that the exercise of power by the State Government in reserving certain areas for the development of Manganese Ore by GMDC was legal and in the public interest. The court also rejects the petitioner's contentions about violation of their legitimate rights, violation of principles of natural justice, and malafide intentions. The court concludes that policy decisions are not beyond the pale of judicial review, but interference by the court should be limited to certain grounds.

The court order states that an executive order termed as a policy decision is not beyond the pale of judicial review. The court can interfere with the policy decision if it is unconstitutional, dehors the provisions of the Act and Regulations, if the delegate has acted beyond its power of delegation, or if the executive policy is contrary to the statutory or a larger policy. The court cannot interfere with the nitty-gritty of the policy or substitute one for the other. The court can subject a policy decision to judicial review on certain grounds. The court also discusses various cases related to policy decisions and legitimate expectations. The court ultimately dismisses the Special Civil Applications and vacates the interim relief granted in each petition.

In summary, the court heard several writ petitions related to the grant of a mining lease for Manganese Ore to Maruti Minerals & Metals. The court was asked to quash and set aside the impugned notification and order and direct the respondent to complete the formality of execution of the mining lease in favor of the petitioner. The court also discussed disputes related to the reservation of an area for mining of Manganese Ore exclusively for a government-owned corporation, GMDC, and the reservation of an area for mining of manganese ore in Gujarat, India.
