The Karnataka State Board for Prevention and Control of Water Pollution filed an application under Section 33 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, seeking a restraint order against Sri Krishna Spinning and Weaving Mills from discharging untreated effluent or trade wastes into a nalla joining Vishwabharathi river, which was likely to cause pollution. The Board also requested an interim order restraining the Respondents from discharging affluent in the nalla pending disposal of the main application. However, the Learned Magistrate held that he had no jurisdiction to grant an interim order of injunction under Section 33 of the Act.

The Karnataka High Court, in response to the Board's appeal, held that the power to grant an interim order of the type sought for in the present case is implicit in the power conferred under Section 33 of the Act. The Court directed the Magistrate to consider the application made by the petitioner seeking an interim order of injunction and to pass suitable orders in accordance with the law.

The case highlights the importance of preventing water pollution and the role of the State Board in enforcing regulations to protect the environment. The Court's decision reinforces the Board's authority to seek injunctions against entities that violate pollution control laws and emphasizes the need for prompt action to prevent further harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the Court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment and the need for strict enforcement of pollution control laws. The ruling reinforces the authority of the State Board to seek injunctions against entities that violate environmental regulations and highlights the need for prompt action to prevent further harm to the environment.
