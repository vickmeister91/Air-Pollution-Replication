The court has granted bail to five applicants, namely Chheda, Bana, Toofan, Ravindra, and Muda, who were in custody since 11th December 2015 in connection with a case registered under Sections 9, 50, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application without expressing any view on the merits of the case and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing their presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The case registered against the applicants pertains to the violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Act aims to protect wild animals and plants and their habitats. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants. The Act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, for the conservation of wild animals and plants.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is significant as it allows them to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. The court did not express any view on the merits of the case, which means that the decision to grant bail was based on other factors, such as the applicants' personal circumstances and the likelihood of them appearing before the court on all the dates of hearing.

The court directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused to appear before the court on all the dates of hearing. A surety is a person who undertakes to produce the accused before the court on all the dates of hearing. The court's direction to furnish a personal bond and a surety is aimed at ensuring that the accused appear before the court on all the dates of hearing.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court did not express any view on the merits of the case, which means that the applicants are still presumed innocent. The court's decision to grant bail also takes into account the applicants' personal circumstances, such as their age, health, and family background.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to five applicants who were in custody since 11th December 2015 in connection with a case registered under Sections 9, 50, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application without expressing any view on the merits of the case and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing their presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial. The court's decision to grant bail is in line with the principles of natural justice and takes into account the applicants' personal circumstances.
