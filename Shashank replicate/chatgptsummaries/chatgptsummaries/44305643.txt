In the first court order, a petition was filed by K.C. Jain (Deceased) through LR's against the Union of India and others. The petitioners sought a direction to mutate an allotted plot and issue a lease without demanding affidavits, indemnity bonds/probate of will and without making further demand of damages. The court provided a detailed background of the case, including the Gadgil Assurance, which was to provide displaced persons with the option of purchasing the site occupied by them against payment in easy installments of the value of the land assessed and on condition of paying the ground rent. The court also mentioned the allotment of a 200 sq. yards plot in New Rajendra Nagar in the name of the petitioner's father, subject to several conditions. The court noted that the petitioners had made payments towards damages and that a suit filed by them seeking a declaration and injunction restraining the respondents from recovering the amount of damages was dismissed.

In the second court order, the residents' contention that the 11 plots were not in a residential zone was rejected, and the L&DO was directed to hand over possession of the plots to the allottees within two weeks. The allottees must move from the ridge area before May 31, 1997, and none of the trees on the plots can be cut without the sanction of the authority. The Ridge Management Board is directed to take over possession of the ridge area from the 11 persons on June 1, 1997, and do the necessary plantation and fencing. The petitioners were asked to produce affidavits from each of the legal heirs to execute the lease in favor of Shri K.C. Jain. The court directed the respondents to process the case of the petitioners insofar as the mutation is concerned subject to the issuance of the development charges. The court also noted that the petitioner had already vacated and shifted from the property before the order was passed.

In the third court order, 11 ridge occupants were ordered to vacate the premises within a month, as they had not vacated the premises despite a court order in 1996. The Ridge Management Board was directed to furnish a report within a month. The petitioners had filed an application to bring on record subsequent developments, including the fact that they had vacated the property much before the due date and had carried out demolition of the constructed area. The Respondents had filed a reply justifying the demand for damages. The L&DO had clarified that the squatters were allotted alternative plots of 200 sq. yds. each irrespective of the area of land unauthorisedly occupied by them.

In the fourth court order, a dispute over the ownership of two plots of land in Aram Bagh Place was addressed. The court found that there was no evidence to support the claim that there were two distinct plots, and that the surrender certificate and will only showed that the late Shri Sham Chand Jain had constructed two buildings on the plot. The court also found that the petitioners were liable to pay damages for overstaying on the land, and dismissed the petition and pending applications.

Overall, these court orders address various disputes related to land ownership and possession. The court has provided detailed background information and has made specific directives to resolve the disputes. In some cases, the court has dismissed petitions and upheld demands for damages. The orders highlight the importance of following legal procedures and adhering to court orders.
