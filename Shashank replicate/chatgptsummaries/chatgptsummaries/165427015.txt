The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by Sri G Mallikarjuna Babu against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner sought a direction to expedite the issuance of a notification granting a mining lease for iron ore in Dharmapuri Village, Sandur Taluk, Bellary District. The Central Government had already granted approval for the lease in 2010, but the state government had not issued the necessary notifications, causing delays in obtaining clearances from the Forest Department.

The court order directed the Secretary (Mines) to issue the notification within six weeks and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court did not award any costs in this case.

The petitioner had argued that the delay in issuing the notification was causing him financial losses and that the state government was not taking any action despite repeated requests. The court noted that the delay was due to the state government's failure to issue the necessary notifications and that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that the lease would be granted in a timely manner.

The court also observed that the delay was causing a loss to the state exchequer as well, as the mining lease would generate revenue for the government. The court, therefore, directed the Secretary (Mines) to issue the notification within six weeks and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a central legislation that regulates the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. Under this Act, any proposal for diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes requires the approval of the Central Government. The Act also requires the state government to obtain the consent of the concerned Gram Sabha or village council before diverting any forest land.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of timely action by the government in granting mining leases and obtaining clearances from the Forest Department. The delay in this case had caused financial losses to the petitioner and the state exchequer, and the court's direction to expedite the process will help prevent such delays in the future.

The court's decision also underscores the need for transparency and accountability in the process of granting mining leases and obtaining clearances from the Forest Department. The court's direction to consider the application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, will ensure that the necessary environmental clearances are obtained before the mining lease is granted.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is a positive development for the mining industry in Karnataka and highlights the importance of timely action by the government in granting mining leases and obtaining clearances from the Forest Department. The court's direction to expedite the process and consider the application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, will help prevent delays and ensure transparency and accountability in the process.
