The National Green Tribunal is a specialized forum for the resolution of environmental disputes. It was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving environmental issues. It has the power to hear appeals against orders passed by the central and state pollution control boards. The tribunal is also empowered to hear cases related to the conservation of forests and other natural resources.

The court's decision to direct the petitioner to resort to the National Green Tribunal is in line with the principle of exhaustion of remedies. This principle requires that a petitioner exhaust all available remedies before approaching a court of law. The principle is based on the idea that administrative bodies and tribunals are better equipped to deal with technical and specialized issues related to environmental law.

The writ petition was disposed of by the court. This means that the court has completed its consideration of the matter and has made a final decision. The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition indicates that it has found no merit in the petitioner's arguments.
