The Sudarsanam Spinning Mills and other textile mills in Rajapalayam, Virudhungar District, filed writ petitions against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for issuing notices that they violated the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, by replacing their old diesel generator sets with furnace oil generators without obtaining fresh consent from the Board. The mills argued that the new generators were more efficient and did not cause air pollution. However, the court ruled that obtaining fresh consent was necessary for any alteration or replacement of control equipment, as per the Act and the General Conditions imposed in the Consent Orders. The court also noted that the new generators were co-generation plants that required environmental clearance from the State Government/Board.

The court order states that the petitioners cannot claim that their consent orders cover any replacement of equipment, and that the Pollution Control Board has the right to issue a show cause notice for alleged violations of the Air (P&CP) Act. The petitioners must make necessary applications and satisfy the Board about the efficient functioning of replaced generator sets using furnace oil. The Board must determine whether the Furnace Oil Generator emits foul smell or air pollutants. The court directs the petitioners to make applications to the Board for replacement of Diesel Generator sets with Furnace Oil Generator, stating the nature of the generator and fuel efficiency. The court dismisses all writ petitions and orders no costs.
