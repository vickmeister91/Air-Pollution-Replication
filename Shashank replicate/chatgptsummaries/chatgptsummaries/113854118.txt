In recent court orders, Manjit Singh Chawla was acquitted of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, due to lack of evidence. The prosecution had accused Chawla and his partner of trading in mongoose hair brushes, which are illegal under the Act. The prosecution presented witnesses who testified to the recovery of 542 brushes from Chawla's shop, but the defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove the brushes were made of mongoose hair. The court found that the witnesses were not entirely sure about the genuineness of the recovered brushes and that expert opinion was necessary to prove the hair's origin.

The court order discusses the inconsistencies and doubts in the prosecution's case against the accused, who were charged with possessing mongoose hair brushes, which is illegal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court notes that the prosecution witnesses' testimony is unreliable and contradictory, and that no independent witnesses were present during the raid or search, which casts doubt on the prosecution's version of events. The court also cites legal precedents that require the investigating agency to join independent witnesses in cases involving secret information and search and seizure operations. Overall, the court finds the prosecution's evidence insufficient to prove the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court order states that there were inconsistencies in the statements of prosecution witnesses regarding the presence of public witnesses during the search and seizure of the accused. The authorized officer did not attempt to associate any independent witnesses during the search, which raises doubts about the credibility of the evidence. The court emphasizes that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and that the acquittal of a guilty person is preferred to the conviction of an innocent person. Due to the contradictions in the testimony and lack of corroboration, the court concludes that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and acquits the accused. The bail bond is cancelled, and any confiscated property is to be returned to the state.

In all three court orders, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, resulting in the acquittal of the accused. The court emphasized the importance of independent witnesses in cases involving secret information and search and seizure operations. The court also highlighted the need for expert opinion to prove the origin of the hair used in the brushes. The court's decision to acquit the accused was based on the lack of credible evidence and inconsistencies in the prosecution's case. The court's emphasis on the importance of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt reflects the fundamental principle of the criminal justice system. The court's decision to cancel the bail bond and return any confiscated property to the state further emphasizes the importance of upholding the law while ensuring justice is served.
