In a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Purushottam Kumar against the State of Bihar and others, the court order pertains to the closure of his unit and the refusal of consent by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner was aggrieved by these orders and sought relief from the court. However, the court dismissed the writ application as nobody appeared to press it.

Despite the dismissal of the writ application, the court ordered the respondents to ensure that the order impugned is implemented forthwith, if not already done. This means that the respondents must comply with the orders that were issued against the petitioner's unit and the refusal of consent by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ application may have been due to the lack of representation by the petitioner or any other interested party. It is important for parties to be present and actively participate in court proceedings to ensure that their interests are protected and their grievances are heard.

The court's order to implement the impugned orders immediately is significant as it ensures that the orders are not ignored or delayed. This is important in cases where the orders are related to environmental protection or public health and safety.

It is unclear from the court order what specific orders were issued against the petitioner's unit and the refusal of consent by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. However, it is likely that these orders were related to environmental regulations and pollution control measures.

Overall, the court's order highlights the importance of compliance with environmental regulations and the need for parties to actively participate in court proceedings to protect their interests. It also emphasizes the role of the court in ensuring that orders related to environmental protection and public health and safety are implemented promptly.
