The High Court of Gujarat recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed regarding the placement of pipelines in a marine park or sanctuary area without proper permission under the Wild Life Protection Act. The petition was filed against Tata Chemicals Limited (TCL), and the Collector of Jamnagar passed an order to consider the rights of TCL to use pipelines laid with permission in 1959, 1974, 1979, and 1986.

The court heard arguments from both sides and did not allow reporters of local papers to see the judgment. However, the court order recognizes the existing rights of TCL for their brine pipelines and open channel for waste water disposal as of July 20, 1982. TCL provided documentary proofs and underwent site inspections to prove the existence of their pipelines before 1982. The court orders the competent authority to delete the recognized area from the declared Marine Sanctuary Area. However, TCL will have to take approval from the Forest & Environment Dept. of the Govt. for any lines laid or system for waste water disposal carried out in Marine Sanctuary after 1982.

The court order also mentions that no rights will be considered as regularized regarding Govt. land or Forest land by this order. The court recognizes the Collector of Jamnagar's determination that certain pipelines existed prior to 1982, and if a new pipeline was laid before the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972, the respondents did not commit any wrongdoing. However, the court notes that no relief was claimed regarding the discharge of chemical waste in the Marine Sanctuary area, and therefore, the question is not considered in this writ petition.

The court order dismisses the writ petition, and there will be no order as to costs. The order recognizes the existing rights of TCL for their brine pipelines and open channel for waste water disposal as of July 20, 1982, but also emphasizes the need for approval from the Forest & Environment Dept. of the Govt. for any lines laid or system for waste water disposal carried out in Marine Sanctuary after 1982.

The court order highlights the importance of obtaining proper permission and following regulations when it comes to the placement of pipelines in sensitive areas such as marine parks or sanctuary areas. It also emphasizes the need for environmental protection and the responsible disposal of waste water. The court's decision to recognize TCL's existing rights while also requiring approval for any future activities in the Marine Sanctuary area strikes a balance between economic development and environmental protection.
