The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed an appeal by Bhag Singh and others against the State of Punjab and others. The appellants had filed a writ petition in 1994, claiming that industries were operating in residential areas and should be closed. The High Court asked for a report from the Punjab Pollution Control Board, which showed that most units had complied with pollution control laws. The High Court disposed of the writ petition, directing that pollution norms and standards be verified periodically. 

The appellants challenged the High Court's judgment, claiming that the properties in question were now in a residential area according to the new Master Plan. The respondents argued that the new Master Plan had not yet been notified. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, stating that the effect of the new Master Plan could not be considered until it was notified. 

The case highlights the issue of industries operating in residential areas and the need for strict adherence to pollution control laws. The High Court's decision to verify pollution norms and standards periodically is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that industries do not harm the environment and the health of residents. 

However, the appellants' claim that the properties in question were now in a residential area according to the new Master Plan raises questions about the effectiveness of urban planning and the need for timely notification of such plans. The respondents' argument that the new Master Plan had not yet been notified suggests a lack of urgency in implementing urban planning measures. 

The Supreme Court's decision to dismiss the appeal highlights the importance of following due process and waiting for the notification of the new Master Plan before considering its effect. This decision also emphasizes the need for timely implementation of urban planning measures to prevent such issues from arising in the future. 

In conclusion, the dismissal of the appeal by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Bhag Singh and others against the State of Punjab and others highlights the need for strict adherence to pollution control laws and timely implementation of urban planning measures. The High Court's decision to verify pollution norms and standards periodically is a positive step towards ensuring the health and safety of residents. However, the case also raises questions about the effectiveness of urban planning and the need for timely notification of such plans. The Supreme Court's decision to dismiss the appeal emphasizes the importance of following due process and waiting for the notification of the new Master Plan before considering its effect.
