In the case of Munshi Singh vs Sadiq, a court order was issued on 4 October, 2013. The order stated that there was no representation on behalf of the appellant, and as a result, the appeal was dismissed for default of appearance and non-prosecution with costs.

The case involved a dispute between Munshi Singh and Sadiq. It is unclear from the court order what the nature of the dispute was, but it is clear that Munshi Singh had filed an appeal against a previous decision. However, Munshi Singh did not appear in court to argue his case, and there was no one present to represent him.

As a result, the court dismissed the appeal. This means that the previous decision, which was presumably in favor of Sadiq, remained in place. Additionally, Munshi Singh was ordered to pay costs associated with the case.

The court's decision to dismiss the appeal for default of appearance and non-prosecution is not uncommon. When a party fails to appear in court or fails to prosecute their case, the court may dismiss the case. This is because the court cannot make a decision without hearing arguments from both sides.

In this case, it is unclear why Munshi Singh did not appear in court or why he did not have representation. It is possible that he simply forgot about the court date or was unable to attend for some reason. Alternatively, he may have chosen not to pursue the case any further.

Regardless of the reason, the court's decision to dismiss the appeal for default of appearance and non-prosecution with costs serves as a reminder of the importance of attending court and presenting a case. Failure to do so can result in a loss of the case and additional costs.
