The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by Pt. Sudarshan Acharya against his tenants, Sh. Sushil Aggarwal and others, who were occupying a tenanted property located at shop no. 3600, Ward No. IX, Durga Bhawan, Bazar Sita Ram, Delhi-110006. The petitioner claimed that he required the tenanted premises for his own business purposes and that the respondents had caused damage to the property. The respondents filed a leave to defend application, challenging the eviction petition and the petitioner's bona fide requirement.

The court heard both sides and ultimately granted the eviction order in favor of the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner had successfully established that he required the tenanted premises for his business and had no other suitable accommodation available. The court also found that the respondents had failed to raise any triable issue in their leave to defend application.

The court order stated that the petitioner cannot execute the eviction order before six months from the date of the order. No costs were ordered, and the file will be consigned to the Record Room.

The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by both parties. The petitioner had submitted documents to prove that he required the tenanted premises for his business, and that he had no other suitable accommodation available. The respondents had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the eviction would cause them hardship.

The court's decision to grant the eviction order was also based on the fact that the respondents had caused damage to the property. The petitioner had submitted photographs and other evidence to show that the respondents had caused damage to the walls, ceiling, and flooring of the tenanted premises.

The court's decision to grant the eviction order was in line with the provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act, which allows landlords to evict tenants if they require the premises for their own use. The Act also provides for a six-month notice period before the eviction can be executed.

In conclusion, the court order granted in favor of Pt. Sudarshan Acharya, the petitioner, allows him to evict his tenants, Sh.
