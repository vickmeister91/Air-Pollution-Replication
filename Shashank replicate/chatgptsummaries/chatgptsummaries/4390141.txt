The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard an intra-court appeal against an order dismissing a writ petition challenging the cancellation of affiliation and election of the M.P. State Taekwondo Association. The respondents argued that the petitioner was not a state within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and therefore the petition was not maintainable. The court considered various precedents and concluded that the petitioner did not satisfy the criteria for being an instrumentality or agency of the state. The appeal was dismissed.

The court order discusses the circumstances under which a writ can be issued for compliance with statutory provisions by private bodies. The court also outlines tests to determine whether a corporation or private body is an instrumentality or agency of the state. The court ultimately concludes that the respondent in the case is not an authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India and dismisses the appeal.
