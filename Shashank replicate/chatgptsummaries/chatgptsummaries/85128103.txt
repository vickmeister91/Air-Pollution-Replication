The case at hand involves a bounced cheque, which is a criminal offence in India. The accused-petitioner had filed two applications, one for the production of certain documents and another to refer the disputed cheques to the Forensic Science Laboratory. The court, however, cited a Supreme Court ruling that stated that the accused can prove the documents while leading defence evidence. This means that the accused can produce the documents during the trial and use them as evidence to support their defence.

The court also noted that the Forensic Science Laboratory is not equipped to handle the examination of cheques. This is an important point to consider, as it highlights the limitations of forensic science in certain areas. While forensic science can be a valuable tool in many criminal investigations, it is not always the best option for every type of evidence.

This expert will be able to provide testimony regarding the authenticity of the disputed cheques.
