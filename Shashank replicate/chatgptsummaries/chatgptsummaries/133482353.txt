The Delhi High Court recently passed a significant order in a case involving M/s Unitech Developers and Projects Private Limited and others against the Regional Officer, Gurgaon Region. The case pertained to a complaint filed under Section 15 of The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and challenged the summoning order passed by the Environment Court. The court allowed the petitions and set aside the complaints, but granted liberty to the respondent to file a fresh complaint.

The case involved multiple petitions filed by M/s Unitech Developers and Projects Private Limited and others against the Regional Officer, Gurgaon Region. The petitioners challenged the summoning order passed by the Environment Court in a complaint under Section 15 of The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court allowed the petitions and set aside the complaints, but granted liberty to the respondent to file a fresh complaint.

The court's decision was significant because it addressed several important issues related to environmental protection and the legal framework governing such cases. The court noted that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, was enacted to provide for the protection and improvement of the environment and for matters connected therewith. The Act empowers the central government to take measures to protect and improve the environment and to prevent and control environmental pollution.

The court also observed that the Act provides for the establishment of various authorities to enforce its provisions, including the Central Pollution Control Board, State Pollution Control Boards, and Pollution Control Committees. These authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with the Act's provisions and taking action against violators.

In the present case, the court found that the summoning order passed by the Environment Court was not sustainable in law. The court noted that the complaint filed by the respondent did not disclose any specific allegations of environmental pollution or violation of the Act's provisions. The court also observed that the complaint was filed after a considerable delay, and there was no explanation for the delay.

The court further noted that the respondent had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act for filing a complaint. The Act requires that a complaint be filed with the appropriate authority, which then conducts an inquiry and takes appropriate action. The court found that the respondent had bypassed this procedure and directly approached the Environment Court.

The court's decision to set aside the complaints was based on these findings. However, the court also granted liberty to the respondent to file a fresh complaint. The court clarified that no plea of limitation or lapse would be raised by the petitioners in case of a fresh complaint.

The court's decision has important implications for environmental protection in India. It underscores the importance of following the legal framework established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, for addressing environmental issues. It also highlights the need for specific and credible allegations of environmental pollution or violation of the Act's provisions to be made in complaints filed under the Act.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a significant step towards strengthening the legal framework for environmental protection in India. It sends a clear message that environmental issues must be addressed in a systematic and credible manner, and that the legal framework established under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, must be followed to ensure effective enforcement of environmental laws.
