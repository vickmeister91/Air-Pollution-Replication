On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, which pertained to multiple cases involving individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The court order listed several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land in Himachal Pradesh. While the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land. The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. Some of the encroachers were proprietors of the village, while others were landless and homeless.

The court refrained from expressing any views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the state government was directed to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and a meeting of all the principal secretaries of such departments was directed to be convened by the Chief Secretary of the government. The final decision must keep in view public interest and cannot give preference to individual hardship. The policy decision, as may be taken by the state government, would be subject to judicial review. Until the final decision was taken, status quo was to be maintained by the parties.

The court order pertained to encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners. The court noted that the issue was a complex one, and it was not possible to arrive at a solution that would satisfy everyone. The court also noted that the issue had been pending for a long time, and it was time for the state government to take a final decision on the matter.

The court order was significant as it recognized the plight of landless and homeless individuals who had been living on government land for a long time. The court recognized that these individuals had no other place to go and that it was not possible to simply evict them from the land. The court also recognized the rights of small and marginalized landowners who had been living on government land for a long time and had no other means of livelihood.
