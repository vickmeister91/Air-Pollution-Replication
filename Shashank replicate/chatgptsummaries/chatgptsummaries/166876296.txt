The court recently issued an order in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Harpal Singh and others. The petitioners had sought a direction from the court to shift the site of the Solid Waste Project from village Dhudhar, District Patiala to any other less inhabited and barren land. The petitioners had alleged that the project would create nuisance and health problems for the residents of the area. The court heard arguments from both sides and found no substance in the allegations made by the petitioners. The court was satisfied with the reply filed by the respondents and dismissed the petition.

The court order states that the petitioners have not provided any statistical data to prove that the Solid Waste Project will cause pollution or nuisance. The Municipal Corporation has provided a methodology for waste collection, segregation, transportation, and disposal that meets the specifications provided in Schedule-III attached with the Rules. The court concludes that there will be no problem of pollution if these steps are taken care of. The court also notes that the land in question was previously in illegal possession and has been taken back by the Gram Panchayat. The court dismisses the writ petition as it sees no merit in it and no interference is called for.

The court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the facts presented by both parties. The petitioners had alleged that the Solid Waste Project would create nuisance and health problems for the residents of the area. However, the court found no evidence to support these claims. The Municipal Corporation had provided a methodology for waste collection, segregation, transportation, and disposal that met the specifications provided in Schedule-III attached with the Rules. The court concluded that if these steps were taken care of, there would be no problem of pollution.

The court also noted that the land in question was previously in illegal possession and had been taken back by the Gram Panchayat. This fact was important in the court's decision as it showed that the land was not being used for any other purpose and was therefore suitable for the Solid Waste Project. The court dismissed the writ petition as it saw no merit in it and no interference was called for.

Overall, the court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the facts presented by both parties. The court found no evidence to support the petitioners' claims that the Solid Waste Project would create nuisance and health problems for the residents of the area. The court also noted that the land in question was previously in illegal possession and had been taken back by the Gram Panchayat. The court dismissed the writ petition as it saw no merit in it and no interference was called for.
