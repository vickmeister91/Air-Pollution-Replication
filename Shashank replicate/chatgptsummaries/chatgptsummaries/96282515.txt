The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Ajay Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a previous writ petition filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme to prevent pollution and remove encroachments. The state was also directed to impose damages or compensation for non-compliance. The court emphasized the importance of fundamental and constitutional rights and the discretionary nature of writ jurisdiction. The court also discussed the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching a writ court and the circumstances in which this principle can be deviated from. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition and allows the petitioner to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court order directs the State to take steps for the construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments on distributories and canals. The State is also directed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. Compliance reports regarding publication of notices and action taken for enforcement of the direction imposing compensation or damages are to be placed before the court. The court also directs the District Collector to be present with all relevant records on the next date of hearing. The State is further directed to remove all encroachments within one month and issue show cause notices to persons causing pollution. The State is to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure.

The court order directs the state to comply with the directions of the Tribunal without failure, and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal that are causing contamination of the canal water. The state is also directed to issue notices to persons who are contributing to pollution and ask them to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/-, and those who resist such claims shall be directed to be present before the Tribunal. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the present proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to environment protection.

The court order states that individuals can file an application or representation by December 31, 2016, and until then, state authorities cannot take any coercive action against them. The court believes that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has the power to condone any delay in the application process and hopes that the NGT will consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. The NGT is requested to sympathetically consider the applications filed by the petitioners. After December 31, 2016, the state can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition is disposed of.
