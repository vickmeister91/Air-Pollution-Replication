The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Nirmendra Singh Rathor under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against Vipendra Singh Baghel and others. The petitioner had filed a private complaint against the respondents under Section 500 of IPC. During the pendency of the criminal case, the petitioner moved an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call the inquiry report which is being conducted by the City Superintendent of Police (Crime), Gwalior in respect of the frivolous complaint which was made by the accused person against the petitioner. The application was rejected by the trial court and the revisional authority.

The court held that since the petitioner had obtained a copy of the inquiry report under the Right to Information Act, he can use it in accordance with the law and there is no need to call the inquiry report from the City Superintendent of Police (Crime), Gwalior who conducted the inquiry. The petition was dismissed.
