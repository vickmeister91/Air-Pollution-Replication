The Calcutta High Court recently heard two criminal revisions seeking to quash two complaint cases pending before the Learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Barrackpore. The petitioners argued that there was no requisite averment in the complaints in terms of Section 74 of The Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 and Section 62 of the Standards of Weights and Measures, (Enforcement) Act, 1985. They also argued that they were not involved in running the day-to-day affairs of the company and that the allegations were patently absurd and inherently improbable.

The court referred to previous decisions and held that it is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. The court order states that merely being a director of a company is not enough to make a person liable under Section 141 of the Act. The person sought to be made liable should be in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time. Managing directors or joint managing directors are liable under Section 141 as they are in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company.

The court also explains who can be considered as persons in charge of and responsible to the company for the business of the company. The court further clarifies that for making a person liable under Section 141 (2), there should be necessary averments in the complaint as to how and in what manner the accused was guilty of consent and connivance or negligence and therefore, responsible under sub-section (2) of section 141 of the Act. Only a Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer can be made liable under sub-section (2) of section 141.

The court order discusses the requirements for making a complaint under section 141 of the Act. It states that for managing directors or joint managing directors, it is sufficient to make an averment that they held the position at the relevant time, as the prefix "managing" implies responsibility to the company. For directors or officers who signed a cheque on behalf of the company, no specific averment of responsibility is necessary, as signing the cheque implies responsibility. For other officers of the company, an averment of responsibility is necessary to bring the case under section 141(1), but they can also be made liable under section 141(2) by making necessary averments relating to consent and connivance or negligence.

The court also cites a previous case to illustrate the importance of making clear averments of responsibility in a complaint. Finally, the court finds that one petitioner's complaint is not tenable due to a lack of necessary averments, but the other petitioner, who is the General Manager of the company, can be held responsible based on the nature of his duties.

The court order states that the General Manager of the accused company is responsible for its day-to-day business and is therefore vicariously liable for any offenses committed by the company. The court dismisses the criminal revisions for the General Manager and quashes the case against the petitioner no. 1. The application for extension of interim order is also disposed of. The Criminal Section is directed to provide certified copies of the judgment to the parties upon request.

In summary, the Calcutta High Court clarified the requirements for making a complaint under section 141 of the Act. The court held that it is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. The court also explained who can be considered as persons in charge of and responsible to the company for the business of the company. The court further clarified that for making a person liable under Section 141 (2), there should be necessary averments in the complaint as to how and in what manner the accused was guilty of consent and connivance or negligence and therefore, responsible under sub-section (2) of section 141 of the Act. The court dismissed the criminal revisions for the General Manager and quashed the case against one of the petitioners.
