The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to four individuals who were apprehending arrest in a case registered for the offences punishable under sections 379 and 420/34 of the IPC and sections 4/40 of Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1972 and Section 15 of Prevention of Pollution Act. The prosecution case was that on 1.4.2018, under the leadership of the District Magistrate, Aurangabad, Kochar sand ghat was raided where 35 tractors were found loaded with sand but on the arrival of police, after unloading the sand the tractor drivers started escaping from the scene with tractors. However, on chase, 29 empty tractors were seized and rest managed to escape. 

The court considered the fact that the empty tractors were seized maliciously and the petitioners had no criminal antecedent, and granted anticipatory bail on the condition of furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned CJM, Aurangabad. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had no prior criminal record and that the seizure of the empty tractors was done maliciously. 

Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of an arrest. This provision is available to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offence. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect the person from unnecessary harassment and detention by the police. 

In this case, the petitioners were apprehending arrest in a case registered for the offences punishable under sections 379 and 420/34 of the IPC and sections 4/40 of Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1972 and Section 15 of Prevention of Pollution Act. Section 379 of the IPC deals with theft, while section 420 deals with cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property. Section 4/40 of Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1972 deals with the transportation of minerals, while Section 15 of Prevention of Pollution Act deals with the penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act. 

The prosecution case was that on 1.4.2018, under the leadership of the District Magistrate, Aurangabad, Kochar sand ghat was raided where 35 tractors were found loaded with sand. However, on the arrival of police, after unloading the sand the tractor drivers started escaping from the scene with tractors. On chase, 29 empty tractors were seized and rest managed to escape. The prosecution alleged that the petitioners were involved in the transportation of sand illegally and were trying to escape when the police arrived. 

The court, however, considered the fact that the empty tractors were seized maliciously and the petitioners had no criminal antecedent. The court also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had appeared before the police whenever required. The court, therefore, granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners on the condition of furnishing bail bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned CJM, Aurangabad. 

The decision of the court is significant as it upholds the principle of innocent until proven guilty. The court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners based on the fact that they had no prior criminal record and that the seizure of the empty tractors was done maliciously. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had appeared before the police whenever required. 

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the four individuals in this case is a significant one. The court has upheld the principle of innocent until proven guilty and has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners based on the fact that they had no prior criminal record and that the seizure of the empty tractors was done maliciously. The decision of the court is a reminder that the legal system is based on the principles of justice and fairness, and that these principles must be upheld at all times.
