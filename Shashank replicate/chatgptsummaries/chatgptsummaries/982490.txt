The Kerala High Court recently dismissed petitions challenging complaints and proceedings against the managing director of a distillery for discharging untreated effluents into the backwaters of Kochi in violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court found that the order passed under Section 33 of the Act was unexceptionable and that the State Board was entitled to delegate its power to grant sanction for prosecution to the Chairman. The court also held that a complaint filed under the sanction granted by the Chairman would not be bad, and a competent court would be justified in taking cognizance of the alleged offense.

The court order discusses the issue of sub-delegation of power by a statutory authority. It states that while the legislature can permit delegation of power, sub-delegation can only be allowed if expressly permitted or implied by necessary implication. The court cites previous cases to support its decision that the complaints in this case, which were laid by the first respondent with the sanction of the Chairman, are valid and the court has no grounds to interfere with the proceedings. The court dismisses the case and orders it to be disposed of within two months.

The case in question involves the managing director of a distillery who was accused of discharging untreated effluents into the backwaters of Kochi in violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The State Board had granted sanction for prosecution to the Chairman, who then granted the necessary sanction for the complaint to be filed. The managing director challenged the validity of the complaint, arguing that the Chairman did not have the power to grant sanction for prosecution.

The court, however, found that the order passed under Section 33 of the Act was unexceptionable and that the State Board was entitled to delegate its power to grant sanction for prosecution to the Chairman. The court also held that a complaint filed under the sanction granted by the Chairman would not be bad, and a competent court would be justified in taking cognizance of the alleged offense.

The court order also discusses the issue of sub-delegation of power by a statutory authority. The court notes that while the legislature can permit delegation of power, sub-delegation can only be allowed if expressly permitted or implied by necessary implication.

The court ultimately dismisses the petitions challenging the complaints and proceedings against the managing director of the distillery and orders the case to be disposed of within two months. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the power of the State Board to delegate its authority to grant sanction for prosecution to the Chairman. It also clarifies the issue of sub-delegation of power by a statutory authority and provides guidance for future cases involving similar issues.
