A series of court orders have been issued in various lawsuits related to illegal construction activities and violations of building regulations. One such lawsuit was filed by Dileep Nevatia against Arkay Holdings Ltd and others for illegally constructing a building on an adjoining plot and violating various regulations. The plaintiff sought damages of Rs. 10 crores and the setting aside of the permission granted to the defendant to construct the building and use dynamite for blasting rocks. The court provided a background of the facts and mentioned that the suit was filed in 1994, with a substantial amendment made in 1997. The court also mentioned a Notice of Motion taken out by the plaintiff in 1995, which resulted in an ad-interim injunction against the defendant.

In another lawsuit, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had constructed a multi-storied building with inadequate open space and had violated DCR 1991. The defendant denied these claims and stated that the building was constructed in accordance with the sanctioned plan and regulations. The court framed issues related to the lawsuit and has not yet made a final decision.

In a third lawsuit, the court ruled that the suit was not required to be maintainable despite non-service of answered in view of statutory notice U/s. 527 of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act. The plaintiff failed to prove that defendant no. 1 committed any illegal construction activity as alleged in the plaint. The court also ruled against the plaintiff's claim for damages against defendant no. 1 to the tune of Rs.10 Crore. The court found that the plaintiff was not entitled to claim any amount from defendant no. 1 on account of interest at the rate of 24% per annum from the date of filing of the suit. The court also ruled that the plaintiff was not entitled to claim exclusively the entire amount of damages prayed in prayer clause (a) of the plaint. The court considered evidence and submissions from both parties before making its final order.

In yet another lawsuit, the court awarded damages to the plaintiff for mental agony and breach of peace suffered by them due to the defendant's alleged illegal construction. The plaintiff presented evidence through witnesses to support their claims, while the defendant chose not to present any evidence. The court relied on various legal precedents to support the plaintiff's case, including the polluter pay principle and the requirement for prior approval for construction in certain areas. The cost of acquisition of the land has also been taken into account. The defendant has been ordered to pay damages and interest, and the alleged illegal construction is required to be demolished.

In a separate lawsuit, the plaintiff claimed damages for violations created by drilling machines and compressors used for excavation. The defendant argued that any violation of the license would fall under the Explosives Act and not within the court's jurisdiction. The defendant also argued that the structure in question is not a multi-storeyed building and meets all criteria for a basement as defined in the DCR regulations. The court found that the building is not a multi-storeyed building and that there is enough open space for fire engines to move around. Therefore, the plaintiff's case regarding the inadequacy of open space fails.

In another lawsuit, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had violated regulations related to open space and FSI, and had caused damages to the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant had not violated any regulations and the plaintiff had failed to prove substantial damages. The court dismissed the lawsuit and the plaintiff's claim for damages.

In a final lawsuit, the court affirmed that the construction of the building was in accordance with the plans and there was no violation of the DCR or CRZ Notification. The plaintiff's claim for damages was dismissed as there was no proof of mental agony or loss caused. The court also stated that the plaintiff had failed to prove any illegal construction activity by the defendant. The suit was dismissed with no order as to costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of adhering to building regulations and obtaining proper permissions before undertaking any construction activities. Failure to do so can result in legal action and significant damages being awarded to affected parties.
