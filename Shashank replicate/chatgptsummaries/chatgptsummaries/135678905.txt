The first court order pertains to an appeal filed by the Government of Tamil Nadu against an order passed by a single judge in a writ petition filed by M. Raghupathy and others. The judge had granted an interim order of status quo with regard to the removal of earth and erection of poles/towers in respect of lands owned by the petitioners alone. The government argued that the writ petition was barred by the principles of constructive res-judicata, as all the issues raised in the present writ petition were raised before the National Green Tribunal, Chennai, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The government also argued that the project had been stalled because of the proceedings initiated by the applicant and that public interest was more important than the private vested interest of certain individuals.

The second court order discusses a case where writ petitions were filed challenging a project in the High Court. The court raised two questions for consideration: whether the agreement between the government and the project was fraudulent, and whether excess land was acquired for the project. The court also discusses the need for approval under the Indian Electricity Act for transmission lines and the importance of obtaining consent from landowners. The court also mentions the principle of Constructive Res-judicata and how it applies to the case. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition.

The third court order discusses a case involving the laying of a transmission line and the application of Section 68 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The court finds that Section 68 only applies to overhead lines and not dedicated transmission lines, as defined in Section 2(16) of the Act. The court also discusses the granting of an interim order and the tests that must be satisfied for such an order to be granted. The court ultimately allows the parties to approach the Learned Single Judge for an early final disposal of the matter.

The principle of constructive res-judicata is a legal principle that prevents a party from raising the same issue in a subsequent proceeding if the issue has already been decided in a previous proceeding. The government argued that the issues raised in the writ petition had already been decided by the National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court, and therefore, the writ petition was barred by the principle of constructive res-judicata.
