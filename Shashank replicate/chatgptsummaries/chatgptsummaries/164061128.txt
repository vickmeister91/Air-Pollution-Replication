The recent court order pertains to two appeals filed by M.S. Nagaraja Karanth against the Managing Director of BMTC and the Corporation itself. The appeals are related to a compensation claim for an accident that occurred on June 29, 2004. The court found that the matter needed to be reconsidered and set aside the previous judgment and award. The case was remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh hearing, and the appellant's deposit was to be refunded to the Corporation.

The accident in question occurred on June 29, 2004, when a BMTC bus hit a two-wheeler ridden by M.S. Nagaraja Karanth. The accident resulted in serious injuries to Karanth, who subsequently filed a compensation claim against the BMTC and its Managing Director. The claim was initially heard by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, which awarded Karanth a compensation of Rs. 3,50,000. However, both Karanth and the BMTC were dissatisfied with the judgment and filed appeals in the Karnataka High Court.

The High Court heard the appeals and delivered its judgment on August 31, 2021. The court found that the matter needed to be reconsidered and set aside the previous judgment and award. The court noted that the Tribunal had not considered certain crucial aspects of the case, such as the fact that Karanth was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. The court also observed that the Tribunal had not properly assessed the extent of Karanth's injuries and the impact they had on his ability to work and earn a livelihood.

In light of these observations, the High Court remitted the case to the Tribunal for a fresh hearing. The court directed the Tribunal to consider all the relevant evidence and make a fresh assessment of the compensation payable to Karanth. The court also directed the Tribunal to take into account the fact that Karanth was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident and to assess the impact of this on his injuries and his ability to work.

The High Court also directed that the appellant's deposit be refunded to the Corporation. The deposit had been made by the Corporation as a condition for filing the appeal. The court noted that since the appeal had been allowed and the matter remitted to the Tribunal for a fresh hearing, there was no need for the deposit to be retained by the court.

Overall, the court order represents a significant development in the long-running legal battle between M.S. Nagaraja Karanth and the BMTC. The order sets aside the previous judgment and award and directs the Tribunal to conduct a fresh hearing and make a fresh assessment of the compensation payable to Karanth. The order also directs the Tribunal to consider all the relevant evidence, including the fact that Karanth was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident. The order is likely to have significant implications for the compensation payable to Karanth and for the wider issue of road safety in Karnataka.
