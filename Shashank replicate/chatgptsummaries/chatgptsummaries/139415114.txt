On October 17, 2019, the Allahabad High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by Ganga Ram Bhola against the State of U.P. and four others. The petition was dismissed on the grounds that an alternative remedy was available under Section 31 of The AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner was given the liberty to approach the concerned authority and file an appeal within three weeks, which would be considered and decided on merits within four weeks.

The writ petition filed by Ganga Ram Bhola was related to the issue of pollution control in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner had sought directions from the court to the State of U.P. and four others to take necessary steps to control pollution in the state. The petitioner had also sought directions to the authorities to take action against the polluting industries in the state.

The court, however, dismissed the petition on the grounds that an alternative remedy was available under Section 31 of The AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted the remedy available under the Act and had directly approached the court. The court further observed that the remedy available under the Act was an effective and efficacious remedy and should be exhausted before approaching the court.

The court, therefore, gave the petitioner the liberty to approach the concerned authority and file an appeal within three weeks. The court directed the concerned authority to consider the appeal on merits within four weeks of its filing. The court also observed that the concerned authority should consider the appeal in accordance with the law and the principles of natural justice.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition and direct the petitioner to approach the concerned authority under Section 31 of The AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is in line with the principle of exhaustion of remedies. The principle of exhaustion of remedies requires that a petitioner should exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court. This principle ensures that the court's time is not wasted on matters that can be resolved through other means.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision to dismiss the writ petition filed by Ganga Ram Bhola and direct the petitioner to approach the concerned authority under Section 31 of The AIR (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a reminder of the importance of the principle of exhaustion of remedies. The court's decision ensures that the petitioner exhausts all available remedies before approaching the court and ensures that the court's time is not wasted on matters that can be resolved through other means.
