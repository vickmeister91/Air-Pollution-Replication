The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to violations of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. In the first case, Raj Kumar Gupta, the sole proprietor of M/s Kanwarji Raj Kumar shop in Delhi, appealed his conviction for violating the Act and was sentenced to three years of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh. Gupta argued that he was not aware of the notice issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and had complied with the directions soon after he became aware of it. He also claimed that the prosecution failed to prove that the alleged material discharged by his unit was poisonous, noxious, or polluting. However, the court ultimately upheld his conviction.

In the second case, the appellant appealed his conviction under Section 26 of the Water Act, arguing that there was no evidence to prove that he discharged any affluent before the Act was implemented in 1974. However, the court found that the appellant did not deny that his shop was in operation on the day of inspection and that no facility for the treatment of affluent was installed at the site. The appellant also admitted that the entire trade affluent generated during the washing process was being discharged into the Municipal Sewer Lines without treatment. The court ultimately upheld his conviction.

In the third case, the accused was found guilty of violating the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by not installing an Affluent Treatment Plant or oil/grease trap in his kitchen where large scale manufacturing processing of namkeens was being carried out. The accused's defense that he did not require consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee was not proven, and the prosecution's witnesses supported their case. The court upheld the guilty verdict and rejected the accused's plea for a lenient sentence.

Finally, in the fourth case, the appellant was accused of violating the Water and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts and requested a lenient view, citing that he is the earner of the family and has already suffered the agony of trial for the last seventeen years. The respondent opposed the grant of a lesser sentence, claiming that the appellant is still continuing to indulge in similar violations. The court set aside the impugned order on sentence and remanded the case back to the Ld. Trial Court to afford an opportunity to the parties to place such material on record and thereafter give an opportunity to the parties to lead their evidence on the aspect of sentence. The appeal was partially allowed, and the parties were to appear before the Ld. Trial Court on 04.09.2017.

In all of these cases, the court upheld the importance of complying with the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and ensuring that proper measures are taken to prevent pollution. The court also emphasized the need for evidence to support any claims made by the accused and the importance of following due process in determining the appropriate sentence.
