The case in question involves a petitioner who filed a revision to challenge the order of the Family Court disallowing the application to call the bank account details of the respondent. The petitioner claimed that the respondent, who owns a construction company, has an income of Rs. 1,50,000 per month but has claimed to be a supervisor. The court rejected the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. as the bank account details would not determine the income of the respondent. The court found no illegality, irregularity or perversity in the order and dismissed the revision.

The petitioner's argument was that the respondent had claimed to be a supervisor, but in reality, he was the owner of a construction company and had an income of Rs. 1,50,000 per month. The petitioner wanted to call for the bank account details of the respondent to prove his claim. However, the court rejected the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court held that the bank account details would not determine the income of the respondent. The court found that the petitioner had not made out a case for calling the bank account details of the respondent.

The court also found that there was no illegality, irregularity or perversity in the order of the Family Court. The court held that the Family Court had considered all the relevant factors and had come to a reasoned decision. The court found that the Family Court had not committed any error of law or fact in disallowing the application to call the bank account details of the respondent.

The court's decision is based on the interpretation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. Section 91 provides that a court may issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing if it is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. However, the court may not issue a summons or order for the production of a document or thing if it would cause unreasonable delay or expense, or if the document or thing is not relevant or necessary for the purposes of the proceeding.

In this case, the court found that the bank account details of the respondent were not relevant or necessary for the purposes of the proceeding. The court held that the bank account details would not determine the income of the respondent. The court found that the petitioner had not made out a case for calling the bank account details of the respondent.

The court's decision is also based on the principle of evidence. Evidence is the means by which a fact is proved or disproved. Evidence can be oral or documentary. Documentary evidence includes any material that is recorded in writing, such as a bank statement. The admissibility of documentary evidence depends on whether it is relevant, authentic and reliable.

In this case, the court found that the bank account details of the respondent were not relevant to the issue at hand. The court held that the bank account details would not determine the income of the respondent. The court found that the petitioner had not made out a case for calling the bank account details of the respondent.

The court's decision is also based on the principle of fairness. Fairness is the quality of being just, impartial and reasonable. Fairness requires that all parties to a proceeding be given an opportunity to present their case and to be heard. Fairness also requires that the decision-maker be impartial and unbiased.

In this case, the court found that the Family Court had considered all the relevant factors and had come to a reasoned decision. The court found that the Family Court had not committed any error of law or fact in disallowing the application to call the bank account details of the respondent. The court held that the Family Court had acted fairly and impartially.

In conclusion, the court rejected the petitioner's revision to challenge the order of the Family Court disallowing the application to call the bank account details of the respondent. The court held that the bank account details would not determine the income of the respondent and that the petitioner had not made out a case for calling the bank account details of the respondent. The court found no illegality, irregularity or perversity in the order of the Family Court and dismissed the revision. The court's decision is based on the interpretation of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., the principle of evidence and the principle of fairness.
