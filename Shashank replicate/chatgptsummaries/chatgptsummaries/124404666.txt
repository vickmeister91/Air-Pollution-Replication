The court order in question pertains to two criminal petitions filed by K N Muralikrishna against Smt Pankaja Pandu. Muralikrishna is currently facing trial for an offense under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (NI Act) and had filed applications before the learned Magistrate seeking permission to produce a document and examine a witness in support of his case. However, the applications were dismissed by the Trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge, and the court found no infirmity in their orders, dismissing the petitions.

Section 138 of the NI Act deals with the dishonor of a cheque for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The section provides for a criminal penalty in the form of imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. The section also provides for a civil liability on the part of the drawer to pay the amount of the cheque along with interest and costs to the payee.

In the present case, Muralikrishna had filed two criminal petitions seeking permission to produce a document and examine a witness in support of his case. The Trial Magistrate dismissed both the petitions, and Muralikrishna filed a revision petition before the Sessions Judge. The Sessions Judge also dismissed the petition, and Muralikrishna approached the High Court challenging the orders of the Trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, observed that the Trial Magistrate had dismissed the first petition on the ground that the document sought to be produced was not relevant to the case. The High Court noted that the document was a letter written by the complainant to the accused, and it was sought to be produced to show that the complainant had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds in the account of the accused at the time of issuing the cheque. The High Court held that the document was relevant to the case, and the Trial Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition.

The High Court further observed that the Trial Magistrate had dismissed the second petition on the ground that the witness sought to be examined was not necessary for the case. The High Court noted that the witness was the manager of the bank where the accused had an account, and he was sought to be examined to prove that the accused had sufficient funds in the account at the time of issuing the cheque. The High Court held that the witness was necessary for the case, and the Trial Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition.

The High Court also considered the order of the Sessions Judge, who had dismissed the revision petition filed by Muralikrishna. The High Court observed that the Sessions Judge had not given any reasons for dismissing the petition, and had merely affirmed the order of the Trial Magistrate. The High Court held that the Sessions Judge had failed to exercise his revisional jurisdiction properly, and had erred in dismissing the petition.

In light of the above observations, the High Court set aside the orders of the Trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge, and allowed the petitions filed by Muralikrishna. The High Court directed the Trial Magistrate to permit Muralikrishna to produce the document and examine the witness in support of his case. The High Court also directed the Sessions Judge to reconsider the revision petition filed by Muralikrishna and pass a reasoned order on the same.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to two criminal petitions filed by K N Muralikrishna against Smt Pankaja Pandu. The petitions sought permission to produce a document and examine a witness in support of Muralikrishna's case, who is facing trial for an offense under Section 138 of the NI Act. The Trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge had dismissed the petitions, and the High Court found no infirmity in their orders. However, the High Court observed that the Trial Magistrate and the Sessions Judge had erred in dismissing the petitions, and set aside their orders. The High Court directed the Trial Magistrate to permit Muralikrishna to produce the document and examine the witness, and directed the Sessions Judge to reconsider the revision petition filed by Muralikrishna and pass a reasoned order on the same.
