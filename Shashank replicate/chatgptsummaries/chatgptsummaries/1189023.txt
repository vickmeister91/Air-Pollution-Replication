The court orders in question relate to cases of unauthorized construction in the Bhiwandi district of Thane, Maharashtra. In the first case, an advocate filed a writ petition for the demolition of a building constructed by the appellants on a plot of land. The High Court directed the appellants to provide certified copies of documents and ordered the demolition of the unauthorized structure. The appellants appealed the decision, arguing that the Municipal Council had the jurisdiction to regularize the construction, but the court rejected their arguments and upheld the demolition order. The court also quashed a resolution passed by the Municipal Council seeking to regularize unauthorized constructions.

In the second case, the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act required individuals intending to construct a building to obtain permission from the Planning Authority. The Act also outlines penalties for unauthorized construction and empowers local authorities to issue notices for demolition. The case in question involves the unauthorized construction of a building by the appellants, who were granted repair permission but proceeded to construct a new building without obtaining the necessary permission. The Municipal Council issued a notice for demolition, but failed to carry out the demolition and instead passed a resolution seeking to impose penalties on unauthorized constructions. The court held that the Municipal Council was obligated to carry out the demolition and did not have the power to regularize unauthorized constructions.

The third court order emphasizes that unauthorized constructions can only be regularized in accordance with rules, and actions should only be taken to regularize and recover development fees in such cases. Municipal councils do not have the jurisdiction to direct regularization of unauthorized constructions beyond the scope of the MRTP Act. The court also emphasizes that discretionary power must be exercised in the larger public interest and that leniency cannot be granted if it affects public safety, convenience, or health. The court dismisses the appeals and directs the Municipal Council to carry out the order of the High Court expeditiously. The appellants are also directed to deposit a sum of Rs. 50,000/- as costs for misleading the court.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of obtaining proper permissions and following regulations when constructing buildings. They also emphasize the responsibility of local authorities to enforce these regulations and carry out demolition orders when necessary. The court's emphasis on public safety, convenience, and health underscores the importance of considering the larger public interest when making decisions about unauthorized constructions. By upholding demolition orders and quashing attempts to regularize unauthorized constructions, the court is sending a clear message that regulations must be followed and public safety must be prioritized.
