The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has been at the center of a recent court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Shrusti Agro and Cold Storage. The petitioner challenged an order passed by KSPCB directing the closure of its industrial operations. However, the court declined to entertain the writ petition, stating that the KSPCB order was appealable under Section 33-B(C) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court noted that the case involved disputed questions of facts that needed adjudication at the hands of the Statutory Tribunal in a regularly constituted appeal. As such, the writ petition was dismissed, leaving it open for the petitioner to take recourse to appropriate remedy in accordance with the law.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and utilizing the appropriate legal channels when challenging government orders. In this instance, the court recognized the need for the Statutory Tribunal to adjudicate the disputed questions of facts, rather than entertaining the writ petition directly.

It is also worth noting that the KSPCB's order to close the industrial operations was likely based on concerns over pollution and environmental impact. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, provides for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of wholesomeness of water. As such, the KSPCB has a duty to ensure that industrial operations do not have a detrimental impact on the environment.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and utilizing the appropriate legal channels when challenging government orders. It also highlights the need for environmental regulations and the role of agencies such as the KSPCB in ensuring that industrial operations do not have a negative impact on the environment.
