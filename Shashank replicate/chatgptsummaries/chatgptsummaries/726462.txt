The Gujarat High Court recently granted a draft amendment and heard a case involving Oswal Agricom Pvt Ltd and the Union of India. The petitioners sought a declaration that officials of respondent no.2 had no authority to take action against them, and that respondent no.3 and respondent no.4 were the competent authorities for regulating imports/exports and transactions concerning units in the Kandla Special Economic Zone. The petitioners' containers were detained, rendering 5,000 workers jobless for five months, and they incurred demurrage and other charges in crores to shipping companies in foreign exchange.

The court examined various reports and affidavits and found that the Customs authorities had no jurisdiction to issue a Show Cause Notice. The court order states that the Customs authorities cannot issue a Show Cause Notice to a unit situated in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) without satisfying the court about their jurisdiction and authority. The court believes that the SEZ Act, 2005 provides specific authorities for such matters, rendering the Customs authorities functus officio.

The court granted ad interim relief to the petitioners subject to compliance with all provisions and further orders by the court. The matter is returnable on February 26, 2009.
