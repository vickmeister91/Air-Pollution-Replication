The court heard three writ petitions involving similar issues related to the grant of a mining lease for Manganese Ore to Maruti Minerals & Metals. The petitioner argued that the impugned notification and order issued by the government were illegal, arbitrary, and irrational. The court was asked to issue a writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus, a writ of certiorari or a writ in the nature of certiorari or any other appropriate writ, order or direction quashing and setting aside the impugned notification and order. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the grant of a mining lease for an area reserved for Manganese Ore mining by the State Government. The petitioner argues that they have legal rights accrued from earlier orders passed by the government granting them the lease, and that subsequent notifications reserving the area for exclusive mining by a government-owned corporation should not affect their rights. The respondent argues that the petitioner has no locus to challenge the government's policy decisions, and that the government's actions were taken in the public interest after due consideration of various factors. The court will need to consider whether the petitioner's legal rights have been affected by subsequent government actions, and whether the government's actions were taken in accordance with the law and in the public interest.

The court order discusses the issue of reserving an area for mining of Manganese Ore by a public sector undertaking, respondent No.5-GMDC, and the petitioner's challenge to it. The respondent argues that the reservation is a legislative function and that the petitioner has no legal right to mine Manganese Ore as it has not applied for a license under the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. The court examines various provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, and the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960, and concludes that Section 17-A(2) empowers the State Government to reserve an area for mining operations through a Government company or Corporation owned or controlled with the approval of the Central Government. The court also considers the petitioner's argument of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel and concludes that the reservation is in the interest of the general public and does not violate any law.
