The Adimali Grama Panchayat and Kavalangad Grama Panchayat have filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, claiming that they have been collecting sand from the banks of the Periyar river going through their respective areas. They argue that Section 218 of the Panchayat Raj Act vests all public water courses, beds, and banks of rivers in the Panchayats, and they have been exercising their rights under the Protection of River Banks Act and regulation of Collection of Sand (Act 18 of 2001).

However, the Forest Range Officer has issued communications stating that the banks of the river passing through the Panchayats' areas are forest land and hence they are reserved forests. The Forest Department has also issued a notice to the Panchayats to stop sand mining activities in the area. The Panchayats have challenged this notice in court, arguing that they have the right to collect sand from the river banks.

The court has ordered the first respondent to constitute a High-Powered Committee consisting of three members to resolve the dispute between the Panchayats and the Forest Department. The committee will be headed by a retired judge of the High Court and will have two other members, one from the Forest Department and one from the Panchayats. The committee will have the power to examine all relevant documents and records and to hear the parties before making its recommendations.

The court has also directed the Panchayats to stop sand mining activities in the area until the committee submits its report. The committee has been given a period of three months to submit its report to the court.

The court has observed that the dispute between the Panchayats and the Forest Department is a complex issue involving legal, environmental, and social aspects. The court has emphasized the need for a balanced approach to resolve the dispute, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders.

The court has also noted that the issue of sand mining from river banks is a matter of concern in many parts of the country. The court has observed that unregulated sand mining can have serious environmental consequences, including erosion of river banks, loss of biodiversity, and damage to aquatic ecosystems. The court has emphasized the need for a comprehensive policy to regulate sand mining activities in the country.

In conclusion, the court has ordered the constitution of a High-Powered Committee to resolve the dispute between the Panchayats and the Forest Department regarding sand mining activities in the area. The committee has been given a period of three months to submit its report to the court. The court has emphasized the need for a balanced approach to resolve the dispute, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. The court has also highlighted the need for a comprehensive policy to regulate sand mining activities in the country.
