Santosh Panika, who was arrested on August 28, 2019, in connection with a case registered at Police Station Forest Range Kotma, District Anuppur (M.P.) for the offence punishable under Sections 9, 39, 50 & 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, filed a bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The prosecution alleged that Panika was found in possession of flash, two bones and some hair of a wild pig during a search of his house.

The bail application was heard by the court, and after hearing arguments from both sides, the court allowed the bail application and directed Panika to furnish a bail bond of Rs.50,000 with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before the trial Court on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which aims to protect wild animals and plants and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, regulation of hunting, and trade in wildlife and their products.

The Act also provides for penalties for offences related to hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable, which means that the accused cannot be released on bail unless the court is satisfied that there are grounds for granting bail.

In the present case, the court considered the arguments of both sides and allowed the bail application filed by Panika. The court directed Panika to furnish a bail bond of Rs.50,000 with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before the trial Court on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The court's decision to grant bail to Panika is significant as it highlights the importance of the principle of presumption of innocence, which is a fundamental principle of criminal law. The principle of presumption of innocence means that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.

The court's decision to grant bail to Panika also highlights the importance of the right to bail, which is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The right to bail means that a person who is arrested or detained has the right to be released on bail unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that he has committed an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Santosh Panika highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the principle of presumption of innocence and the right to bail. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for strict enforcement of the Act to protect wild animals and their habitats.
