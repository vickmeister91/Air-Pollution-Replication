The court order pertains to a dispute over ownership of property in Koheda village, Ranga Reddy district. The case involves five revisions against the orders of the Joint Collector, with the core issue being a rival claim over who are the Protected Tenants (PTs) of the property. The revisions were filed by six petitioners who are sons of late Satti Reddy, who is the brother of Kandada Yadi Reddy. The court also mentions the impleadment of unofficial respondents who claim to have purchased some of the plots in the disputed property. The order lists the plot numbers and extent of land claimed by the implead petitioners.

The court order lists various plots of land with their respective sizes and registration details. It also mentions the agreement of sale cum GPA with possession deed numbers and dates for each plot. The order also includes the names of petitioners who are being impleaded in the case.

The court order involves multiple implead petitions and revisions related to land ownership. The revision petitioners opposed the implead petitions, but ultimately, all the implead petitions were allowed by the court. The revision grounds in the case involve issues related to the validity of certificates and records, and the failure of the quasi-judicial authority to act judicially. The counter-arguments of the respondents state that the Joint Collector's order is based on revenue records and there is no illegality committed. The R.2 initially passed an order granting 38-E certificates after correction of records, and the R.1 relied on these records.

The court order from 03.02.1984 granted 38-E certificates to villagers in Koheda village after correction of tenancy records. The Tahsildar conducted a local enquiry and prepared a corrected tenancy register based on physical possession, which was accepted by those in actual possession. The register showed the names of protected tenants and their extents of land. The names of those not in physical possession were deleted from the survey numbers. The petitioners did not raise any objections and later executed a GPA after receiving 38E certificates for corrected survey numbers.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the correction of a protected tenancy (PT) list and the granting of a 38E certificate. The petitioners had accepted the corrections and even executed sale deeds to third parties based on the corrected survey numbers. The court found that the petitioners cannot claim the wrong survey numbers which were shown in their name earlier and that the provisions of the AP (Telangana area) Tenancy Act are not applicable in view of the change of nature of the land. The court also found that the petitioners had taken advantage of the corrected survey numbers and cannot put forth any claim on the earlier incorrect protected tenancy survey numbers. The court dismissed the revisions and found that the claims made by the petitioners were false and unsubstantiated.

The court order states that the petitioners are legal successors of the PT and any correction or alteration made without notifying them is illegal and violates the Act and principles of natural justice. The alleged enquiry and correction of records did not take place, and assuming it did, it was done without issuing any notice to the PT or his legal heirs. The court also denies the claim that the subject lands were converted into non-agriculture and sold to third parties. The Joint Collector dismissed the appeals by order, dt.11.07.2014, holding that if the appellants have any objection, they ought to have filed the same before the RDO at the time of publication of provisional list and final list of protected tenancy. The court allows the revisions.

The court order pertains to a dispute over protected tenancy rights for certain lands. The court found that the original protected tenants, Kandada Yellaiah and Thatichettu Devaiah, were entitled to the lands in question and that the unofficial respondents had no right to claim them. The court also noted that unless a protected tenancy is terminated in accordance with the law, it continues to subsist. The court set aside the 38-E certificate issued in favor of the unofficial respondents and directed the Joint Collector, RDO, and MRO to grant the Section 38-E certificates to the petitioners and mutate their names in the revenue records. The court considered several relevant principles and propositions in reaching its decision.

The court order pertains to the protection of tenants who have cultivated land personally for a period of at least six years. The landholder cannot terminate the tenancy unless certain conditions are met, such as the landholder being a minor or serving in the military. The order also outlines the process for determining who is a protected tenant and their rights, including the right to purchase the land they are cultivating.

The court order outlines the procedure for a protected tenant to purchase land from a landholder. The Tribunal will determine the reasonable price of the landholder's interests in the land, and the protected tenant must deposit the amount determined by the Tribunal. If the protected tenant fails to pay the entire amount, they forfeit the right to purchase the land. The right of the protected tenant to purchase the land is subject to certain conditions, including the extent of the land remaining with the landholder after the purchase. The court order also includes provisions for when the landholder agrees to sell or relinquish their rights in the land to the protected tenant. Additionally, the order outlines the ownership transfer of lands
