The Gauhati High Court recently heard a case (WP(C) 1083/2013) filed by Anandram Saikia against the State of Assam and six others, including M/S Pashupati Nath Bricks, for operating a brick kiln without proper consent. The case had a complicated history, with previous orders being set aside and show cause notices being issued. The petitioner claimed that the brick kiln had started operating again without proper procedure being followed. The court heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on whether the brick kiln should be allowed to operate.

The court order discusses a case involving a wildlife sanctuary and a brick kiln located less than a kilometer away. The petitioner argues that the kiln is causing pollution and should be shut down, while the respondents argue that the kiln is operating within permissible limits and that the petitioner has filed the case out of business rivalry. The court ultimately dismisses the case, stating that the petitioner has not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims and that there are doubts about their motives for filing the case.
