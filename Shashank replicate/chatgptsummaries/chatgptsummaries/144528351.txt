In a recent court order, Santosh and Akash were granted bail after being in custody since November 11, 2014, for an offense under The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court took into consideration the disability certificate of Santosh and allowed the bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.

The court ordered that the applicants be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.20,000 each with one solvent surety each. Additionally, they are required to appear before the trial court on all hearing dates.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act aims to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats, as well as to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

Santosh and Akash were accused of violating this act, which led to their arrest and subsequent detention. However, the court considered the disability certificate of Santosh and granted them bail.

Section 439 of Cr.P.C. provides for the grant of bail in cases where the accused is in custody during the trial. The section states that a person who is in custody during the trial may be released on bail if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offense.

In this case, the court was satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing that Santosh and Akash were not guilty of the offense. The court also took into consideration the disability certificate of Santosh, which may have influenced the decision to grant bail.

The court ordered that the applicants be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.20,000 each with one solvent surety each. A personal bond is a written promise by the accused to appear in court on all hearing dates and to comply with any other conditions imposed by the court. A solvent surety is a person who guarantees the payment of the bond amount in case the accused fails to appear in court.

The court also ordered that the applicants appear before the trial court on all hearing dates. This is a standard condition imposed by the court when granting bail. The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the accused attends all court hearings and does not abscond.

In conclusion, the court order granted bail to Santosh and Akash, who had been in custody since November 11, 2014, for an offense under The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court considered the disability certificate of Santosh and allowed the bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. The applicants were to be released on furnishing a personal bond of Rs.20,000 each with one solvent surety each and were required to appear before the trial court on all hearing dates.
