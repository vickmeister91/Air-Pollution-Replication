In the first court order, the case pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction where the petitioner's employment was terminated due to invalid certification. The court found no justification to interfere with the order as the principles of natural justice were not applicable in this case. The court cited the "useless formality theory" and quoted a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Canara Bank Vs. V. K. Awasthi to support its decision.

The "useless formality theory" is a legal principle that states that if a decision has already been made, and the outcome would not have been different even if the principles of natural justice had been followed, then there is no point in setting aside the decision. In the present case, the court found that the petitioner's employment was terminated due to invalid certification, and there was no evidence to suggest that the principles of natural justice would have led to a different outcome. Therefore, the court refused to interfere with the order.

In the second court order, the court discusses various opinions and criticisms regarding the discretionary power of courts in granting public law remedies. The court notes that while there is no unanimity on the matter, courts can refuse to grant certiorari, prohibition, mandamus or injunction even if natural justice is not followed. The order also notes that in cases where facts are not admitted or beyond dispute, there is a considerable divergence of opinion on whether the applicant needs to prove a case of substance or a real likelihood of success.

The court ultimately decides not to express an opinion on the "useless formality theory" and leaves the matter for decision in an appropriate case. The order concludes that unless failure of justice is occasioned or it would not be in public interest to do so, the court may refuse to grant relief to the concerned employee.

In the third court order, the court dismissed a writ petition based on previous judgments and found no merit in the petitioner's argument. The court did not provide any further details on the case or the arguments made by the petitioner.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of natural justice in legal proceedings. While the principles of natural justice are not always applicable, they play a crucial role in ensuring fairness and impartiality in decision-making. The court's discretionary power in granting public law remedies is also a topic of debate, with different opinions and criticisms on the matter. Ultimately, the court's decision to grant relief depends on the specific circumstances of each case and whether failure of justice would be occasioned or it would not be in public interest to do so.
