In a recent court order, a petitioner was accused of violating a decree of injunction in O.S.No.79 of 2004. The petitioner argued that he had complied with all the conditions laid down in the decree and had taken all pollution control measures. The Environmental Engineer and the advocate commissioner reported that the flour mill was functioning within the prescribed limits of sound level. However, the learned Munsiff held that the petitioner had violated the decree of injunction and ordered his detention in civil prison and attachment of his property.

The petitioner then appealed to the higher court, arguing that the lower court had erred in its decision. The higher court reviewed the case and found that there was no violation of the decree. The court set aside the order of the lower court and released the petitioner from detention.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had complied with all the conditions laid down in the decree and had taken all necessary pollution control measures. The Environmental Engineer and the advocate commissioner had also reported that the flour mill was functioning within the prescribed limits of sound level. Therefore, there was no basis for the lower court's decision to order the petitioner's detention and attachment of his property.

This court order highlights the importance of complying with court orders and taking necessary measures to ensure that all conditions are met. It also emphasizes the need for courts to carefully review all evidence and information before making a decision that could have serious consequences for the parties involved.

In conclusion, the court's decision to set aside the order of the lower court and release the petitioner from detention was based on a careful review of the evidence and information presented in the case. The court found that there was no violation of the decree and that the petitioner had complied with all necessary conditions and measures. This case serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with court orders and the need for courts to carefully review all evidence before making a decision.
