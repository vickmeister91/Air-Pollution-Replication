The Kerala High Court issued a judgment in a case involving Canon Granites Private Limited and the Pollution Control Board. The industry had applied for consent to install two additional secondary crushers, which the Board rejected. However, the industry proceeded to install the crushers anyway, leading to action by the Board. The case also involved allegations of illegal gratification and false documents created by certain officials to protect an individual facing criminal charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The government imposed a minor penalty of censure on one official, and the affected party filed a writ petition challenging the decision. The allegations against the officials were serious and, if proven, could result in various offenses under the Indian Penal Code.

The court order discusses allegations against Jeyaprasad, who was the Chairman of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The allegations are serious and could result in various offenses under the Indian Penal Code. However, the State of Kerala did not register any crime against Jeyaprasad and only initiated a departmental proceeding of disciplinary action, which resulted in a minor punishment of censure. The court also examines two writ petitions and the competence of the State to reduce the tenure of Jeyaprasad's office as Chairman. The court notes that Jeyaprasad was appointed as Chairman in exercise of the powers conferred on the Government of Kerala and that conviction for an offense involving moral turpitude is a disqualification for being a member of the State Pollution Control Board.

The court order states that if the allegations of fabricating false evidence against Jeyaprasad are proven, he would be guilty of an offense under Section 192 of the Indian Penal Code and may also be guilty of abetment. The court orders the State of Kerala to register a criminal case against Jeyaprasad based on the allegations made in the memo of charges dated 31.10.2008. The court also notes that the State's failure to investigate such allegations is a violation of its constitutional obligations. The court further states that exercising the jurisdiction under Article 226 in favor of a person whose credentials to hold a public office are highly doubtful would not be a sound exercise of discretion. Two petitions, W.P.(C) Nos. 11235 of 2010 and 20211 of 2010, are dismissed.

The court order dismisses several appeals and writ petitions related to a corruption case involving an engineer in the Pollution Control Board Service. The court upholds certain observations made in the original judgment, which criticized the government's handling of the case and called for a departmental inquiry against the engineer. The court finds the state of affairs unsatisfactory and sees no reason to interfere with the judgment's observations.
