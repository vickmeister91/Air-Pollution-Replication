Ayub Raza, the petitioner, filed a petition to quash the criminal proceedings against him, including the FIR, for alleged offenses under various acts. The petitioner claimed that he was not connected to the alleged offense and that the prosecution case was flawed. The Assistant Sub-Inspector who filed the FIR was not authorized to do so for the alleged offense under the Mines and Minerals Act. The State argued that there was no illegality in the FIR and that the offenses were distinct in nature.

The case was heard by the court, and after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court ordered that the case be put on hold until December 10, 2014. The court also ordered that no coercive action be taken against the petitioner until then.

The petitioner's argument was that he was not connected to the alleged offense and that the prosecution case was flawed. The petitioner claimed that the Assistant Sub-Inspector who filed the FIR was not authorized to do so for the alleged offense under the Mines and Minerals Act. The petitioner argued that the FIR was illegal and that the case should be quashed.

The State, on the other hand, argued that there was no illegality in the FIR and that the offenses were distinct in nature. The State argued that the petitioner was connected to the alleged offense and that the case should proceed.

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court ordered that the case be put on hold until December 10, 2014. The court also ordered that no coercive action be taken against the petitioner until then. This means that the petitioner cannot be arrested or detained until the next hearing.

The court's decision to put the case on hold until December 10, 2014, gives both parties time to prepare their arguments and evidence. It also gives the court time to consider the arguments and evidence presented by both parties before making a final decision.

In conclusion, the court has ordered that the case be put on hold until December 10, 2014, and no coercive action be taken against the petitioner until then. The court will hear the arguments and evidence presented by both parties before making a final decision on the case.
