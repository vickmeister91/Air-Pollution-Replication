The Delhi High Court has ordered the shifting of a biomedical waste treatment facility located in Sukhdev Vihar to an alternative site. The court order was issued in response to a case filed by residents of the area against the operation of the facility in their vicinity. The facility was established by the Government of NCT of Delhi in collaboration with M/s Synergy Waste Management Pvt. Ltd. to treat and dispose of biomedical waste generated by hospitals, nursing homes, and pathological labs.

The court noted that the waste generated by hospitals, nursing homes, and pathological labs, termed as biomedical waste, is required to be disposed of in accordance with the Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998. The court also noted that the facility was set up after obtaining consent from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and is meant for the treatment and disposal of biomedical waste collected from different hospitals and health care establishments. However, the court observed that the facility was located too close to residential areas and was likely to cause damage to the environment and adversely affect the health of nearby residents.

The court order emphasized the need to take measures to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the health of citizens. The court noted that the right to live in an environment free from pollution is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The court also acknowledged that any facility that can cause harm to humans, animals, plants, or the environment is liable to be restricted or shut down.

The court further noted that the Central Pollution Control Board guidelines require that a common biomedical waste treatment facility should be located at a place reasonably far away from residential and sensitive areas so that it has minimal impact on these areas. The court ordered the shifting of the facility to an alternative site that does not endanger nearby residents. The government was directed to identify a suitable site within three months and shift the facility within six months. The facility can continue to operate at the present site until it is shifted or six months from the order date, whichever is earlier.

The court order also discussed the use of incinerators for the disposal of biomedical waste and the potential health risks associated with them. The court noted that incinerators emit harmful pollutants such as dioxins and furans, which can cause cancer and other health problems. The court observed that the right to live in a pollution-free environment is a fundamental right and that the use of incinerators for the disposal of biomedical waste should be avoided wherever possible.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court has ordered the shifting of a biomedical waste treatment facility located in Sukhdev Vihar to an alternative site. The court order emphasized the need to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the health of citizens. The court noted that any facility that can cause harm to humans, animals, plants, or the environment is liable to be restricted or shut down. The court also discussed the use of incinerators for the disposal of biomedical waste and the potential health risks associated with them. The court observed that the use of incinerators for the disposal of biomedical waste should be avoided wherever possible.
