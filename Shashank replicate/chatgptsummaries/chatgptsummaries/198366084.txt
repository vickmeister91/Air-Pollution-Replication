The court order pertains to a writ appeal filed by S. Mohammed Yousuf against a show cause notice issued by the fifth respondent under the provisions of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The appellant had possession of an elephant named Rohini under an agreement of maintenance, but the possession was believed to be illegal. The learned Single Judge had directed the appellant to produce the elephant before the Chief Conservator of Forests, Virudhunagar, and dismissed the writ petition, but gave liberty to the respondent to decide which camp would be suitable for accommodating the elephant. The final order did not reference the proposed action on the merits of the contentions raised by the appellant pursuant to the show cause notice.

The court has issued an interim order directing respondents 2 to 6 to allow the appellant to be with the elephant until the interim application is decided on merits and to provide all necessary facilities. The respondents have filed a counter affidavit denying the allegations and questioning the ownership of the elephant. However, the court believes that the appellant's service to the elephant cannot be dispensed with and directs the respondents to allow the appellant to handle the elephant until they pass any orders under the statute. The court also directs the respondents to pass a final order with regard to ownership and the right of the appellant. The appellant is prepared to make an application to sustain his claim of ownership over the elephant. The court is not deciding any issue on merits and orders the respondents to pass further orders keeping in mind the welfare of the elephant. The order of the learned Single Judge in W.P.(MD)No.23608 of 2018 is modified to the extent indicated above and the writ appeal is disposed of.
