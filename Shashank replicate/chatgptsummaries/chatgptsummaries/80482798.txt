The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to environmental violations by M/s. Electrotherm (India) Ltd., a manufacturing company that has expanded its steel plant in Kutch. The petitioners in these cases argue that the company's industrial activities pose a serious threat to public health and the environment, and that the company has violated environmental laws and regulations.

In one case, the petitioner seeks a writ, order, or direction to revoke the environmental clearance granted to Electrotherm for the expansion of its steel plant until environmental norms are strictly complied with. The court is presented with data on the production capacity of the plant before and after expansion. The court order lists the production capacity of various products after the expansion of respondent no.3, including Sponge Iron, Pig Iron, Power Plant, Sinter Plant, TMT Plant, D.I. Pipe, MS Billets/Bars, Stainless Steel Billets, Alloy Nickel, Induction Furnaces, and Electric Cycle and Vehicle. The production capacity of each product is listed in MTPM (metric tons per month) before and after the expansion. The total production capacity after the expansion is also mentioned.

In another case, the court discusses a petition filed against Electrotherm for violating environmental laws by carrying out industrial activities without necessary clearance and consent from authorities. The court cites various laws and regulations related to environmental protection and notes that the company had been operating without necessary clearances and consents. The court also refers to a site visit report that highlights the company's violations, including manufacturing new products without clearance and exceeding consented limits. The court orders the company to stop its expansion plans and comply with environmental laws.

In yet another case, the court states that Electrotherm violated environmental laws by manufacturing ductile iron pipes without obtaining necessary environmental clearance and valid consent. The company also exceeded the consented limit for production and constructed a sinter plant without permission. The petitioner has approached the court to revoke the environmental clearance and other permissions granted to the company. The respondents have opposed the petition, stating that due care was taken while granting the environmental clearance and that the petitioner has an alternative remedy by way of an appeal before the National Environment Appellate Authority. The court has yet to make a decision on the matter.

In one case, the court order states that the petitioner has no right to relief as they have not complied with environmental norms and regulations. The respondent argues that the petitioner is not a fit person to file a public interest litigation and that they are merely a proxy for Electrotherm's business rivals. The respondent also argues that the petitioner has an alternative remedy of appeal before the National Environment Appellate Authority. The court order further discusses the history of Electrotherm's DI Pipe manufacturing business and their compliance with environmental regulations. The respondent denies that Electrotherm's operations emit hazardous pollutants and argues that they have obtained all necessary permits and clearances. The court order concludes that the petitioner's claims are misconceived and that they have filed the petition after a significant delay.

In another case, the court order discusses the legality of environmental clearances granted to Electrotherm for its steel plant, sponge iron, and D.I. pipes. The petitioner argues that the clearances were granted in violation of environmental laws and regulations, while the respondents deny any breaches and claim that the petitioner's allegations are unsubstantiated. The court examines the relevant notifications and regulations and considers the petitioner's contentions, including the lack of public consultation for the expansion of the plant and the violations of environmental laws observed during a site visit.

In one case, the court order discusses a case of severe violation of environmental laws by a manufacturing industry that did not obtain necessary environmental clearance and NOC for its activities. Despite the industry's non-compliance, the authorities did not take any measures to prevent harm to health and the environment. The court also notes that the industry was recommended for the grant of environmental clearance for expansion, despite the severe violations. The order includes arguments from both the petitioner and respondent, including the contention that the petitioner's reliance on certain notifications is without merit and that the industry's violation of environmental norms does not necessarily warrant closure of the factory.

In another case, the court order discusses an environmental clearance granted to Electrotherm and the subsequent inspection of their premises by the Central Pollution Control Board. The report submitted by the Board highlights several violations of environmental norms, including excessive dust and particulate matter in the air, inadequate water sprinkling systems, and lack of proper monitoring facilities. Respondent No.3 (M/s. Electrotherm) clarifies that some of the violations were due to their expansion project and that they have already taken steps to address the issues. The court directs the petitioner to implead the Central Pollution Control Board as a party respondent and orders Electrotherm to comply with the recommendations made by the Board.

In one case, the court order discusses the expansion of Electrotherm's Steel Plant and their application for Consent to Establishment and Consolidated Consent/Authorization. The court rejects the argument that an alternative remedy is available and proceeds to examine the matter on its own merit. The court finds that Electrotherm set up a steel plant in 2005 and received NOC for establishing Sponge Iron unit and Ductile Iron Pipes. They also received environment clearance for expansion of Pig Iron Plant and Captive Power Plant. The court discusses the EIA Notification and a draft Notification suggesting an amendment for public consultation in case of expansion projects
