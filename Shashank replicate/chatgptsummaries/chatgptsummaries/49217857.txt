The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant, Rauf Khan, challenged the dismissal of his application for interim custody of a vehicle seized in connection with a Forest Act case. The court found that the concerned magistrate had no power to pass any order relating to interim or final custody of the vehicle or furniture after an intimation under Section 52-C of the Forest Act was given. 

The applicant had relied on a previous order in a different case, but the court found that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, which were considered in that case, were different from those of the Forest Act. The court dismissed the applicant's petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to first understand the background of the case. The applicant, Rauf Khan, had filed an application for interim custody of a vehicle that was seized in connection with a Forest Act case. The vehicle was seized by the forest department and was in their custody. The applicant had claimed that the vehicle belonged to him and that he needed it for his personal use.

The magistrate, who was handling the case, had dismissed the applicant's application for interim custody of the vehicle. The applicant then challenged this decision in a higher court, citing a previous order in a different case where interim custody of a vehicle was granted to the applicant. However, the court found that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, which were considered in that case, were different from those of the Forest Act.

The court then went on to examine the provisions of the Forest Act and found that Section 52-C of the Act provided for intimation of seizure of forest produce, vehicle or tools to the magistrate. Once such intimation was given, the magistrate had no power to pass any order relating to interim or final custody of the vehicle or furniture. The court found that the concerned magistrate had acted within the provisions of the Forest Act and had correctly dismissed the applicant's application for interim custody of the vehicle.

The court also noted that the applicant had filed his petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. This section provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. However, the court found that the applicant's petition did not fall within the ambit of Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and dismissed it.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where the applicant had challenged the dismissal of his application for interim custody of a vehicle seized in connection with a Forest Act case. The court found that the concerned magistrate had no power to pass any order relating to interim or final custody of the vehicle or furniture after an intimation under Section 52-C of the Forest Act was given. The court also found that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, which were considered in a previous case cited by the applicant, were different from those of the Forest Act. The court dismissed the applicant's petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. as it did not fall within the ambit of the section.
