The court has granted bail to Rakesh, the applicant in a wildlife protection case. Rakesh had filed a bail application stating that he was innocent and had no previous criminal history. The court considered the submissions of both parties and the fact that a similarly situated co-accused had already been granted bail. The court ordered that Rakesh be released on bail subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rakesh was based on several factors. Firstly, Rakesh had no previous criminal history, which indicated that he was not a flight risk or a danger to society. Secondly, the court considered the fact that a similarly situated co-accused had already been granted bail, which suggested that Rakesh should also be granted bail. Finally, the court took into account the submissions of both parties and the evidence presented before it.

The court ordered that Rakesh be released on bail subject to certain conditions. These conditions included not influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence, cooperating in the expeditious disposal of the case, and appearing before the trial court on specific dates. The court made it clear that any violation of these conditions would result in the cancellation of bail.

The condition of not influencing witnesses or tampering with evidence is a standard condition in bail orders. This condition is imposed to ensure that the accused does not interfere with the investigation or the trial.

The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law, which states that an accused is innocent until proven guilty.
