The Supreme Court of India has issued several court orders related to environmental protection and conservation. One of the orders was in response to a writ petition filed by the Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the Union of India to provide clean drinking water to villages affected by pollution in North Arcot District of Tamil Nadu. The court passed an order directing the Central Government to constitute an Authority under Section 3(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The Loss of Ecology Authority (LoEA) was constituted, and for the past 20 years, it has been functioning on and off, entertaining claim petitions from farmers seeking compensation for damage caused to their agricultural fields.

The Union of India sought a modification of the order to transfer all pending matters to the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The Vellore Citizens Welfare Forum filed a writ petition seeking a mandamus to direct the Union of India to make the LoEA a permanent body. The only question before the court was whether the LoEA should be constituted as a permanent body or whether its functions and powers can be transferred to the NGT.

The court order mandates the constitution of the LoEA by the Central Government to implement the "precautionary principle" and the "polluter pays" principle. The LoEA is responsible for assessing the loss to the environment and identifying individuals/families who have suffered due to pollution, determining compensation to be paid, and computing compensation under two heads. The order also imposes a pollution fine on tanneries and directs the closure of industries owned/managed by polluters who refuse to pay compensation. The LoEA is to frame schemes for reversing damage caused by pollution and review industries operating in prohibited areas. The Central Government sought to discontinue the LoEA and transfer its functions to the NGT, but environmentalists argued that the LoEA has unique powers and should not be abolished.

The court order states that expenses towards reversal schemes should be met by the polluter alone. The court also notes that the NGT does not have the power to carry out certain procedures and safeguards for the prevention of environmental pollution, and that its jurisdiction is confined to certain states. The order also provides details of awards and reversal schemes passed by the LoEA. The court discusses the scheme of the NGT Act, 2010, which provides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environment protection and conservation of forest and other natural resources. The court notes that the NGT has both original and appellate jurisdiction and the power to grant relief and compensation to victims of pollution. The court also discusses the precursor acts to the NGT, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the National Environment Tribunal Act, 1995.

The court order discusses the need for the establishment of Environmental Courts in India, as suggested by the Supreme Court in previous cases. The Law Commission of India proposed a comprehensive scheme for the setting up of a judicial body in the form of Environment Court at the State Level, consisting of sitting/retired Judges or members of the Bar with more than 20 years standing assisted by a statutory panel of experts in each State. The proposed court will have original jurisdiction on environmental disputes with all powers of a Civil Court and shall grant all reliefs which a Civil Court can grant under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 or other statutes like the Specific Relief Act. The court will also have appellate jurisdiction under all the three Acts, namely, Water Act, Air Act and Environment Protection Act. The court will have the power to frame schemes and monitor them and also have power to modify the schemes from time to time. The proposed Courts must have similar powers to the Supreme Court and High Courts.

The court order discusses the establishment of environmental courts in India with original and appellate jurisdiction in environmental matters. The court recommends that a law be made by Parliament for the constitution of these courts, which will be manned by three judicial members and a panel of expert commissioners. The court also discusses the creation of the NGT Act, 2010, which was enacted to provide a one-stop-shop solution for environmental issues. The court addresses contentions for the continuance of the LoEA and concludes that it is not necessary to continue the LoEA after the constitution of the NGT. The court also discusses the powers and limitations of the NGT and how it compares to the LoEA.

The court order discusses the amendment of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which made any direction issued by the Central Government under Section 5 appealable to the NGT. The LoEA was constituted as a stop-gap arrangement until a permanent Environmental Tribunal was established. The court concludes that the powers and functions of the LoEA can be effectively discharged by the NGT, subject to certain safeguards. The court orders that all pending claims before the LoEA be transferred to the NGT, and that the Central Government consider rehabilitating the employees of the LoEA by absorbing them into the NGT. The court also grants the office of the LoEA time until June 30, 2016, to wind up and orders the Tribunal to dispose of all transferred claims within six months.

In summary, the court orders issued by the Supreme Court of India relate to environmental protection and conservation. The court ordered the constitution of the LoEA to implement the "precautionary principle" and the "polluter
