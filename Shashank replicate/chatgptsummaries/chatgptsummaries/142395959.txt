The recent court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by M/s. Rao Yogendra Grit Udhyog against the Raj State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Board alone has the power under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the order passed by the Member Secretary, to whom no power has been delegated, is invalid. The court issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a comprehensive legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The Act empowers the central and state pollution control boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. The Act also provides for the delegation of powers by the central and state boards to their officers and employees.

In this case, the petitioner, M/s. Rao Yogendra Grit Udhyog, is a company engaged in the manufacture of grit and sand. The company had applied for consent to operate under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, from the Raj State Pollution Control Board. The Board had granted consent to the company subject to certain conditions.

However, the Member Secretary of the Board had passed an order directing the closure of the company's operations on the ground that the company had violated the conditions of the consent. The petitioner's counsel argued that the Member Secretary had no power to pass such an order as the power to grant or revoke consent had been delegated only to the Board and not to the Member Secretary.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the petitioner's counsel, issued notice to the respondents, which included the Raj State Pollution Control Board and the Member Secretary. The court also stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the principle of delegation of powers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Act provides for the delegation of powers by the central and state pollution control boards to their officers and employees. However, the delegation of powers must be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

In this case, the court found that the Member Secretary had no power to pass the order directing the closure of the company's operations as the power to grant or revoke consent had been delegated only to the Board and not to the Member Secretary. The court's order ensures that the delegation of powers under the Act is done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that the powers of the pollution control boards are not usurped by their officers and employees.

The court's order also has implications for other cases where the delegation of powers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is in question. The order clarifies that the delegation of powers must be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that the powers of the pollution control boards cannot be usurped by their officers and employees.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the civil writ petition filed by M/s. Rao Yogendra Grit Udhyog against the Raj State Pollution Control Board upholds the principle of delegation of powers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's order ensures that the delegation of powers under the Act is done in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that the powers of the pollution control boards are not usurped by their officers and employees. The order has implications for other cases where the delegation of powers under the Act is in question and clarifies that the delegation of powers must be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
