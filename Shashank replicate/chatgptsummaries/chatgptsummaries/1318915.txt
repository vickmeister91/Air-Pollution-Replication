The court recently heard two appeals that were made by the defendants who were challenging the judgment and decree passed by the lower court in two separate civil suits. The plaintiffs had been leased certain lands for mining purposes by the State Government, but the defendants ordered them to stop mining work. The plaintiffs filed civil suits for permanent injunctions, which were granted in their favor. However, the defendants appealed the decision, arguing that the lower court had erred in its judgment.

During the hearing, the court found that the area in question was not reserved for the Forest Department and that the lease granted to the plaintiffs had expired. The court concluded that the appeals did not involve any substantial questions of law and dismissed them both.

The first appeal challenged the judgment and decree passed by the lower court in a civil suit filed by the plaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction against the defendants. The plaintiffs had been granted a lease by the State Government for mining purposes, but the defendants had ordered them to stop mining work. The lower court had granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction, which the defendants appealed.

The second appeal challenged the judgment and decree passed by the lower court in another civil suit filed by the plaintiffs seeking a permanent injunction against the defendants. The plaintiffs had been granted a lease by the State Government for mining purposes, but the defendants had ordered them to stop mining work. The lower court had granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction, which the defendants appealed.

The court found that the appeals did not involve any substantial questions of law. The court noted that the area in question was not reserved for the Forest Department and that the lease granted to the plaintiffs had expired. The court concluded that the lower court had not erred in its judgment and dismissed both appeals.

In summary, the court heard two appeals challenging the judgment and decree passed by the lower court in two separate civil suits.
