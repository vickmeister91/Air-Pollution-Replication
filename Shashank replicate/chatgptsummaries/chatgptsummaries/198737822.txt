The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued a court order in a case filed by Manoj Misra and others against Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. regarding encroachment and dumping of building debris in the riverbed/flood plain and the natural water body of river Yamuna. The NGT has issued several directions, including the imposition of environmental compensation on all households in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi. However, this was challenged by Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd.

The NGT has now directed the implementation of sewerage charges as directed by the Tribunal on 11.09.2019. The direction issued on 08.05.2015 stands modified and need not be implemented. This court order has significant implications for the environment and the people of Delhi.

The NGT has been established under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The NGT has the power to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues and has the authority to issue orders and directions to any person, authority, or government for the protection of the environment.

In this case, the NGT has taken cognizance of the encroachment and dumping of building debris in the riverbed/flood plain and the natural water body of river Yamuna. The NGT has directed Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. to pay environmental compensation for the damage caused to the environment. The NGT has also directed all households in the NCT of Delhi to pay environmental compensation for the damage caused to the environment.

However, Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. challenged the imposition of environmental compensation on them. They argued that they were not responsible for the encroachment and dumping of building debris in the riverbed/flood plain and the natural water body of river Yamuna. They also argued that the imposition of environmental compensation on them was arbitrary and unreasonable.

The NGT has now directed the implementation of sewerage charges as directed by the Tribunal on 11.09.2019. This means that all households in the NCT of Delhi will have to pay sewerage charges for the damage caused to the environment. The direction issued on 08.05.2015 stands modified and need not be implemented. This direction had directed all households in the NCT of Delhi to pay environmental compensation for the damage caused to the environment.

The implementation of sewerage charges is a significant step towards the protection of the environment in Delhi. The NGT has recognized the importance of holding all households accountable for the damage caused to the environment. The implementation of sewerage charges will provide a financial incentive for households to reduce their environmental impact.

In conclusion, the NGT has issued a court order in a case filed by Manoj Misra and others against Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd. regarding encroachment and dumping of building debris in the riverbed/flood plain and the natural water body of river Yamuna. The NGT has directed the implementation of sewerage charges as directed by the Tribunal on 11.09.2019. The direction issued on 08.05.2015 stands modified and need not be implemented.
