The court order pertains to an industrial dispute between M/s Ajudhia Textiles Mills and Sh. Ram Chander. The dispute was referred to the Labour Court to determine whether the termination of Ram Chander's services was illegal and unjustified, and if so, what relief he was entitled to. Ram Chander had been working as a substitute worker in the weaving department and was suffering from T.B. disease due to working in the atmosphere of yarn dust. The management issued him a charge sheet on false allegations of less production and suspended him. The workman was not given a fair opportunity to defend himself, and the principles of natural justice were not adhered to by the enquiry officer. The enquiry officer gave perverse findings, and on the basis of the false and improper enquiry report, the management terminated his services. The workman prayed for passing an award in his favour for his reinstatement in service with full back wages and continuity in service.

The court found that the management conducted the domestic enquiry fairly and properly and considered the evidence and material placed on record. However, the court also noted that the workman had produced evidence of sickness and received sickness benefits, making the dismissal order illegal. The court cited previous cases to support the idea that fair and proper inquiry does not necessarily mean correct findings, and that relief for illegal termination should be decided on a case-by-case basis.

After considering all the evidence and arguments presented, the court awarded the workman Rs. 50,000 in lieu of reinstatement and back wages, with future interest if not paid within 30 days. The order is to be published as per rules.

The court order was issued by an Additional District & Sessions Judge who was also the Presiding Officer of the Labour Court in Karkardooma Courts, Delhi. The order was identified by the ID number 77/10 and was the last page of a 12-page document.
