Thiagarajan against the State represented by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Vigilance and Anti-Corruption, City Special Unit-III, Chennai. The petitioner had requested the production of certain records, including pocket diaries, general diary entries, thapal registers, and telephone registers. The trial court had partly allowed the petition, directing the respondent to produce the general diary but dismissing the other pleas.
