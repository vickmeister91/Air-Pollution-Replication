The case of G. Subramani vs. the first respondent involved a writ petition seeking a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the proceedings of the first respondent and further directing him to permit the petitioner to quarry for a further period of one year, two months, and 12 days, and for further orders. The petitioner was a lessee in respect of survey No.193 Part, Kizhminnal village, Walajah Taluk, Vellore District, for the purpose of quarrying blue metal stones, for a period of five years, from 31.08.1998 to 30.08.2003. The lease was executed on 31.08.1988.

The petitioner claimed that he was prevented from quarrying for the period between 01.04.1998 and 24.06.2003, which he claimed was due to interference by the respondents. However, the court dismissed the writ petition, stating that there is no provision in the rules to extend the period for stone quarrying beyond five years, and the petitioner is not entitled to seek for quarrying the subject lands, which has been notified as forest area.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner's lease had expired, and there was no provision in the rules to extend the period for stone quarrying beyond five years. The court also noted that the subject lands had been notified as forest area, and the petitioner was not entitled to seek for quarrying in that area.

The court's decision was in line with the rules and regulations governing stone quarrying in the area. The rules provide for a lease period of five years, and there is no provision for extending the lease period beyond that. The court's decision was also in line with the government's policy of protecting forest areas and preventing their exploitation for commercial purposes.

The case highlights the importance of following rules and regulations governing natural resources and protecting the environment. It also emphasizes the need for individuals and businesses to respect the government's policies and decisions regarding the use of natural resources.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of G. Subramani vs. the first respondent was based on the rules and regulations governing stone quarrying in the area and the government's policy of protecting forest areas. The petitioner's lease had expired, and there was no provision for extending the lease period beyond five years.
