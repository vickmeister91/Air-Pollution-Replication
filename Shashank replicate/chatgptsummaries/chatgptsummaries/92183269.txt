The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the 3rd Additional Sessions Judge (A.S.J.) in Shivpuri in Sessions Trial No. 258/2014. The applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., seeking to requisition certain documents from the Allahabad Bank Branch in Shivpuri, which he claimed were necessary for his defence and for effective cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. However, the Trial Court had rejected the application.

The court, in its order, allowed the application and remanded the matter back to the Trial Court with a direction to decide the application afresh after considering the necessity and desirability of the documents sought to be summoned by the applicant. This means that the Trial Court will have to reconsider the applicant's request for the documents and determine whether they are indeed necessary for his defence and for effective cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the applicant had approached the High Court under this section, arguing that the Trial Court's order rejecting his application for the documents amounted to an abuse of the process of the court and would result in a failure of justice.

The court, in its order, noted that the documents sought by the applicant were related to the transactions between the accused and the bank, and were therefore relevant to the case. The court also observed that the Trial Court had not considered the necessity and desirability of the documents before rejecting the application. The court, therefore, held that the Trial Court's order was erroneous and needed to be set aside.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of ensuring that all relevant documents are made available to the accused in a criminal trial. The right to a fair trial is a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution of India, and the accused must be given every opportunity to defend themselves effectively. In this case, the court has recognized that the documents sought by the applicant are relevant to the case and could potentially impact the outcome of the trial. By remanding the matter back to the Trial Court, the court has ensured that the applicant's right to a fair trial is protected.

It is also worth noting that the court's order does not automatically mean that the applicant will be granted access to the documents he has requested. The Trial Court will still have to consider the necessity and desirability of the documents before deciding whether to summon them. However, the court's order does make it clear that the Trial Court cannot simply reject the application without considering the relevance of the documents to the case.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that all relevant documents are made available to the accused in a criminal trial. The right to a fair trial is a fundamental right, and the court has taken steps to protect this right by remanding the matter back to the Trial Court with a direction to consider the necessity and desirability of the documents sought by the applicant. This order reaffirms the principle that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done.
