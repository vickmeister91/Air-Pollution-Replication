The State of Rajasthan filed a series of petitions against the Collector of Bundi and another regarding the alteration of boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The issue at hand was whether the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries or if the issue was covered by a previous judgment. 

The State argued that the issue was covered by a previous judgment and that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Collector did have the power to alter the boundaries. 

After hearing both sides, the court ruled in favor of the State. The court stated that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries and ordered the impugned orders to be set aside. The matter was remanded to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents. 

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The court also noted that the issue was covered by a previous judgment, which further supported the State's argument. 

The court's decision has significant implications for the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary and its boundaries. The decision ensures that the boundaries of the sanctuary remain intact and that any changes to the boundaries must be made in accordance with the law. 

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following established legal procedures and ensuring that decisions are made in accordance with the law. The decision also serves as a reminder that the protection of wildlife and their habitats is a crucial issue that must be taken seriously.
