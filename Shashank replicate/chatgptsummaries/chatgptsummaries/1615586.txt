The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various legal challenges to the Infrastructure Corridor Project between Bangalore and Mysore in Karnataka, India. The project involves the construction of an express highway, townships, and other infrastructure developments. The challenges were brought by retired Chief Engineer and public interest litigant, who argued that the agreement between the government and the private contractor, Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprises Limited, was detrimental to the people of the area and against the Constitution of India and laws in force in the country. The petitioner claimed that the real purpose of the project was to develop real estate and not to construct the express highway. The agreement contained illegal terms and conditions binding the Government of Karnataka, including obligations to supply water, power, and facilities for water treatment. The agreement also contained provisions for the construction of townships, tax holidays, and resolution of disputes by way of arbitration to be held at London and governed by the New York Convention Rules of 1956.

In response to these challenges, the court examined the scope of judicial review in contractual transactions of the government and concluded that the court's concern should be limited to legality, such as whether the decision-making authority exceeded its powers or committed an error of law. The court also addressed allegations of arbitrary action, illegality, constitutional violations, mala fides, and illegal infringement of individual rights. Ultimately, the court found that the agreement was legal and transparent and would benefit the public.

The court also discussed the Toll Road as a Corridor Project, which aims to provide water, electricity, and a good environment to people living in small towns along the road. The project requires the acquisition of 20,193 acres of land, and the government has agreed to provide some of the land and acquire the rest. The project is considered a public purpose, and the person for whose benefit the land is acquired is not required to pay conversion charges. The government has the power to develop new townships within the state, and the agreement with the second respondent is not illegal or opposed to public policy. The government has agreed to make its best efforts to accomplish the desired results, but it is not bound to achieve a particular object. The company must receive the required permissions, approvals, sanctions, and/or licenses under various Acts and Rules of the Government of India and Karnataka.

The court also discussed various sections and clauses related to the Infrastructure Corridor Project in Karnataka. It includes exemptions under the Urban Land Act, formation of a greenbelt, stamp duty payable, consent for telecommunication facilities, and the collection of toll taxes. The court rejected arguments that the project would harm the environment, violate public policy, or transfer police powers to the private company. It also addressed concerns about water supply and international arbitration. Overall, the court found no illegality or unconstitutionality in the project and upheld its implementation.

In addition, the court order discussed the need for amendments to the outdated 1940 Act, which contains the general law of arbitration, to make it more responsive to contemporary requirements. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) has adopted the Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration and Conciliation Rules, which have harmonized concepts on arbitration and conciliation of different legal systems of the world. The present Bill seeks to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration, enforcement of foreign arbitral awards, and to define the law relating to conciliation, taking into account the said UNCITRAL Model Law and Rules. The main objectives of the Bill are to comprehensively cover international commercial arbitration and conciliation as well as domestic arbitration and conciliation, to make provision for an arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of the specific arbitration, and to minimize the supervisory role of Courts in the arbitral process. The court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it with no order as to costs.

Overall, the court orders discussed in this summary address various legal challenges to the Infrastructure Corridor Project in Karnataka, India. The court examined the scope of judicial review in contractual transactions of the government and concluded that the court's concern should be limited to legality. The court found no illegality or unconstitutionality in the project and upheld its implementation. The court also discussed the need for amendments to the outdated 1940 Act to make it more responsive to contemporary requirements.
