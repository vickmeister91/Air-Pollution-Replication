The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Citizen Forum against the State of Jharkhand and others. The petitioner sought a direction to restrain M/s. Sun Flower Steel Industries from running its factory in Isri Bazar, Giridih. The petitioner alleged that the factory was illegally established without obtaining a no objection certificate from the Pollution Control Board and was located in a densely populated area.

The Pollution Control Board confirmed that the factory had been started without obtaining a no objection certificate, and ultimately refused to grant one. The respondent no.6, who was the proprietor of the factory, had already preferred an appeal against the rejection of the no objection certificate.

The court noted that the industry was no longer running and the cause of action had become infructuous. As a result, the petition was disposed of.

This court order highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permits and certificates before starting any industrial activity. The Pollution Control Board's refusal to grant a no objection certificate in this case shows that the government is serious about enforcing environmental regulations and protecting the health and safety of citizens.

It is also worth noting that the court's decision to dispose of the petition due to the cause of action becoming infructuous is a common practice in Indian courts. This means that if the issue at hand is no longer relevant or has been resolved, the court will not continue to hear the case.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder to individuals and businesses to comply with environmental regulations and obtain the necessary permits before starting any industrial activity. It also highlights the importance of timely action, as delays can result in the cause of action becoming infructuous and the case being disposed of.
