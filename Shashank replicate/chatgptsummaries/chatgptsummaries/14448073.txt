The case of S. Subramaniam v. State of Tamil Nadu dealt with the petitioner's request for a gun license for his SBBL gun German make. The second respondent, who is the licensing authority, rejected the petitioner's request on the ground that the petitioner's lands were situated within the radius of eight kilometers from the forest land and therefore, the petitioner has to obtain a 'No Objection Certificate' from the Wild Life Warden as required under Section 34(3) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The petitioner filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records relating to the Appeal No. 32/2010 and to quash the same, consequently directing the second respondent to grant a gun license to the petitioner to possess SBBL gun.

The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration. The first respondent shall take a decision on the petitioner's application for grant of license bearing in mind the observations made by the court regarding the applicability of Section 34(3) of the Act.

The court observed that the second respondent had rejected the petitioner's application for a gun license solely on the ground that the petitioner's lands were situated within the radius of eight kilometers from the forest land. The court held that the second respondent had failed to consider the petitioner's case on merits and had not given any reasons for rejecting the petitioner's application.

The court further observed that Section 34(3) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, requires a person to obtain a 'No Objection Certificate' from the Wild Life Warden if the land on which the person intends to use the firearm is situated within the radius of eight kilometers from the forest land. However, the court held that the said provision does not apply to the present case as the petitioner had stated that he intended to use the firearm only for self-defense and not for hunting or any other purpose.

The court also observed that the second respondent had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before rejecting his application for a gun license. The court held that the principles of natural justice require that the petitioner be given an opportunity to be heard before his application is rejected.

In light of the above observations, the court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration. The court directed the first respondent to take a decision on the petitioner's application for grant of license bearing in mind the observations made by the court regarding the applicability of Section 34(3) of the Act. The court also directed the second respondent to afford a personal hearing to the petitioner before taking a decision on his application.

In conclusion, the case of S. Subramaniam v. State of Tamil Nadu highlights the importance of considering a person's case on merits and giving them an opportunity to be heard before rejecting their application for a gun license. The court's decision to set aside the impugned order and remand the matter for fresh consideration ensures that the petitioner's application is considered on its merits and in accordance with the principles of natural justice.
