The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the First Additional Sessions Judge, Vidisha in Criminal Revision No.75/2012. The respondent had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the applicant for issuing a cheque that was returned by the bank. The applicant had requested to examine the Bank Manager in his defense, but failed to pay the process fee. The defense evidence was closed, and an application under Section 311 read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was filed for calling the Branch Manager as a witness in defense, which was rejected by the Trial Court. The applicant had not given any reply to the statutory notice issued by the respondent.

The petitioner had approached the court seeking to set aside the order passed by the Trial Court and to allow the examination of the Branch Manager as a witness in defense. The petitioner had argued that the Trial Court had erred in rejecting the application under Section 311 read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and that the examination of the Branch Manager was necessary for the proper adjudication of the case.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition with a cost of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited by the applicant before the trial court by 27th March 2017. The court also directed the trial court to decide the complaint by the end of April 2017.

The court observed that the petitioner had failed to pay the process fee for examining the Bank Manager as a witness in defense, and that the Trial Court had rightly rejected the application under Section 311 read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court further noted that the petitioner had not given any reply to the statutory notice issued by the respondent, which was a mandatory requirement under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

The court held that the examination of the Branch Manager as a witness in defense was not necessary for the proper adjudication of the case, and that the Trial Court had rightly closed the defense evidence. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to examine any other witness in defense, and that the application under Section 311 read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was filed only as a last resort.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to deposit a cost of Rs. 10,000/- before the trial court by 27th March 2017. The court also directed the trial court to decide the complaint by the end of April 2017.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the First Additional Sessions Judge, Vidisha in Criminal Revision No.75/2012. The court dismissed the petition with a cost of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited by the applicant before the trial court by 27th March 2017 and directed the trial court to decide the complaint by the end of April 2017. The court held that the examination of the Branch Manager as a witness in defense was not necessary for the proper adjudication of the case, and that the Trial Court had rightly closed the defense evidence. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to examine any other witness in defense, and that the application under Section 311 read with Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was filed only as a last resort.
