The court recently granted bail to Suresh Adiwasi, who had been arrested for killing a pig in connection with a wildlife protection act. The applicant's counsel argued that he was a reputable citizen with no criminal past and that the crime was not serious. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount.
