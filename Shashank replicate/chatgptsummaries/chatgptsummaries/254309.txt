The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Biocare Remedies Pvt. Ltd., an industrialist, alleging air pollution caused by a neighboring unit. This was the second writ petition filed by the petitioner on the same issue. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to justify their claims and that no public interest was involved in the matter. The court also imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on the petitioner for filing an adversary litigation to malign the second respondent.

The petitioner had alleged that the neighboring unit was causing air pollution, which was affecting the health of the residents in the area. The petitioner had also claimed that the pollution was causing damage to their property and business. However, the court found that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claims. The court noted that the petitioner had not conducted any scientific study or analysis to prove that the pollution was caused by the neighboring unit.

The court also observed that the petitioner had filed a similar writ petition earlier, which was dismissed by the court. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any new evidence or information in the second petition, and that it was merely an attempt to re-litigate the same issue. The court stated that such actions were a waste of judicial time and resources.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not established any public interest in the matter. The court stated that the petitioner was merely seeking to protect their own interests and that there was no wider public interest involved. The court observed that the petitioner had not shown any concern for the health and well-being of the residents in the area, and that their only concern was their own business interests.

The court also imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on the petitioner for filing an adversary litigation to malign the second respondent. The court observed that the petitioner had made baseless allegations against the second respondent, which had caused harm to their reputation. The court stated that such actions were not acceptable and that the petitioner should be held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Biocare Remedies Pvt. Ltd. alleging air pollution caused by a neighboring unit. The court found that the petitioner had failed to justify their claims and that no public interest was involved in the matter. The court also imposed a cost of Rs. 25,000 on the petitioner for filing an adversary litigation to malign the second respondent. The court's decision sends a strong message that baseless allegations and attempts to re-litigate the same issue will not be tolerated and that those who engage in such actions will be held accountable.
