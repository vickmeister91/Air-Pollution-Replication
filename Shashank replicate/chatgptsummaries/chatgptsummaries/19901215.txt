The National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued an order in response to two applications filed against the Municipal Corporation of Bareilly for operating a municipal solid waste plant without proper authorization and clearance. The Tribunal found that the plant did not meet site specifications and lacked an incinerator for proper waste treatment and volume reduction. The plant was also found to be causing pollution and hazardous waste was affecting neighboring residents and groundwater. The Hon'ble Supreme Court stayed the Tribunal's judgment, but subsequent inspections found that the plant still did not have valid authorization or consent for operation and did not comply with regulations.

The Municipal Corporation argued that the plant was one of the best in India and should be allowed to operate, but the Tribunal ruled that financial gain cannot come at the cost of public welfare. The court cited previous cases where units operating without authorization or in violation of conditions must be closed. The respondent, the waste management plant, had not obtained the necessary consent and authorization from the State Pollution Control Board and had not received approval from the Central Pollution Control Board on the technology used.

Therefore, the court ordered the closure of the waste management plant until all deficiencies were cured and proper authorization was obtained. The court emphasized that the respondent cannot continue to operate without proper authorization and compliance with mandatory requirements under the law. The court's decision was based on the principle that financial gain cannot come at the cost of public welfare.

The NGT's order was a significant step towards ensuring that waste management plants operate in compliance with regulations and do not cause harm to the environment and public health. The NGT's decision was based on the principle of sustainable development, which requires balancing economic development with environmental protection and social welfare.
