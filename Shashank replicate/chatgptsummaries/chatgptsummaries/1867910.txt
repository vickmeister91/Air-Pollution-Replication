The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Vishnu Mor against the Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus declaring the notices issued by the authority as illegal and arbitrary. The petitioner also sought a direction not to interfere with his peaceful possession and enjoyment of the land. The court considered the salient features of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and whether the petitioner was entitled to relief at the stage of notice issued by the authority requiring him to stop construction and obtain approval from the Shore Area Development Authority (SADA). The court also examined when the construction was made and found that there was a dispute on this question.

The court noted that the petitioner did not obtain permission from the concerned Gram Panchayat for construction of the building before the proposed reservation was notified. The court also noted that the petitioner did not construct the house before filing an earlier writ petition, but only partly completed construction after the writ petition was disposed of. The court emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and cited various laws and judgments related to environmental protection. The court advised the petitioner to obtain approval from SADA for the construction and directed that there shall be no development, including any construction, until SADA decides the matter.
