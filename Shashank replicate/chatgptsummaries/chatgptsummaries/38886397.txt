The case of Rajesh Kapoor vs. the respondent police was brought before the court in a Criminal Original Petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The petitioner sought to quash the summons issued by the respondent police under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. The summons directed the petitioner to appear before the police based on a complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra, which the petitioner claimed was civil in nature.

The petitioner argued that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra was civil in nature and therefore, the summons issued by the respondent police under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. were not applicable. The petitioner further argued that the complaint was filed with the intention of harassing him and that there was no merit to the complaint.

The respondent's counsel submitted that the enquiry had been closed and there was no need for the petitioner's appearance. The respondent's counsel also argued that the complaint filed by Shri. Sankalp Malhotra was not civil in nature and that the summons issued by the respondent police under Sections 160 and 91 Cr.P.C. were applicable.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court disposed of the petition and closed the connected miscellaneous petitions. The court did not provide any further explanation for its decision.
