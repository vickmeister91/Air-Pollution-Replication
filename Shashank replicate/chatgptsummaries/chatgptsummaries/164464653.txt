The court order in question relates to a criminal original petition filed by M/s. Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. The petitioner had sought to quash a notice issued by the first respondent in C.No.181/DCB/TVM/2015 dated 20.08.2015 under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. However, when the matter was taken up for admission, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the enquiry in C.No.181/DCB/TVM/2015 is closed. The court recorded the same and closed the petition.

The petitioner, M/s. Kerala State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd., had approached the court seeking to quash a notice issued by the first respondent in C.No.181/DCB/TVM/2015 dated 20.08.2015 under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The notice had been issued in connection with an enquiry being conducted by the first respondent. The petitioner had contended that the notice was illegal and without jurisdiction.

However, when the matter was taken up for admission, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the enquiry in C.No.181/DCB/TVM/2015 is closed. The court recorded the same and closed the petition. This means that the petitioner's request to quash the notice is now moot, as the enquiry in question has already been closed.

It is not clear from the court order what the enquiry in question was about, or why the petitioner had sought to quash the notice. However, it is possible that the enquiry was related to some alleged wrongdoing by the petitioner or its employees, and that the notice was issued in connection with that enquiry.

In any case, the court's decision to close the petition means that the matter is now resolved, and the petitioner will not be able to challenge the notice any further. It is possible that the petitioner may have other legal remedies available to it, but those would need to be pursued separately.

Overall, the court order is relatively straightforward, and simply records the fact that the enquiry in question has been closed, rendering the petitioner's request to quash the notice moot. It is not clear from the order what the underlying dispute was about, or whether there were any broader legal or policy implications to the court's decision.
