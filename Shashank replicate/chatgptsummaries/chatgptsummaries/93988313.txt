The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to four individuals who were apprehending their arrest in a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules, Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, Indian Forest Act, Water (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, Air (Prevention and Control) Pollution Act, and Environment (Protection) Act. The individuals were accused of running a crusher without a valid license, but the seizure lists did not reflect the seizure of any crusher machine, which cast doubt on the validity of the accusation.

The individuals had approached the High Court seeking anticipatory bail, which was granted upon certain conditions. The Court directed the individuals to surrender before the learned Court below within 12 weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount. The Court also directed the individuals to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The individuals were accused of running a crusher without a valid license, which is a violation of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act.

However, the seizure lists did not reflect the seizure of any crusher machine, which raised doubts about the validity of the accusation. The individuals argued that they were falsely implicated in the case and that they had not committed any offence.

The Court observed that the seizure lists did not reflect the seizure of any crusher machine, which cast doubt on the validity of the accusation. The Court also noted that the individuals had no criminal antecedents and were not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence.

The Court directed the individuals to surrender before the learned Court below within 12 weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount.

The Court warned that any violation of the conditions would result in the cancellation of the anticipatory bail.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court granted anticipatory bail to four individuals who were accused of running a crusher without a valid license. The seizure lists did not reflect the seizure of any crusher machine, which raised doubts about the validity of the accusation. The individuals were released on anticipatory bail upon surrendering before the learned Court below within 12 weeks and furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the like amount.
