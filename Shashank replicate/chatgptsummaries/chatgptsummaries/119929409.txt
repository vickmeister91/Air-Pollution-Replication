The court order discusses a case where a petitioner is seeking direction to challenge a demand made by the authorities to obtain an Environment Clearance (EC) from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) for a treatment plant. The petitioner argues that the EC is not necessary as they obtained a building permit before the notification requiring EC came into effect. The court examines the notification and concludes that EC is required before construction of new projects, regardless of the date of the building permit. The court dismisses the petition and upholds the demand for EC.

The petitioner argued that the EC was not necessary as they had obtained a building permit before the notification requiring EC came into effect. The court examined the notification and concluded that EC is required before construction of new projects, regardless of the date of the building permit. The court dismissed the petition and upheld the demand for EC.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the requirement for obtaining an Environmental Clearance (EC) for new construction projects. The court held that EC is required before construction of new projects, regardless of the date of the building permit. This decision has important implications for developers and builders, as it means that they must obtain EC before beginning construction, even if they have already obtained a building permit.

The court's decision is based on the principle of sustainable development, which requires that development be carried out in a manner that is environmentally sustainable. The court noted that the purpose of the notification requiring EC was to ensure that new projects are assessed for their potential environmental impact before construction begins. This assessment is necessary to ensure that the project does not have a negative impact on the environment and that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate any potential impact.

The court's decision is also significant as it upholds the authority of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to require EC for new projects. The petitioner had argued that the MoEF did not have the authority to require EC, but the court rejected this argument and upheld the MoEF's authority.

Overall, the court order clarifies the requirement for obtaining an Environmental Clearance for new construction projects and upholds the authority of the Ministry of Environment and Forests to require EC. This decision has important implications for developers and builders, as it means that they must obtain EC before beginning construction, even if they have already obtained a building permit. The decision is based on the principle of sustainable development, which requires that development be carried out in a manner that is environmentally sustainable.
