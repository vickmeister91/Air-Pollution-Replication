The court order in question pertains to an application filed under section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing a charge-sheet submitted by the Investigating Officer in a wildlife protection case. The applicant's counsel argued that no offence was made out against the applicant and that the prosecution was instituted with a malafide intention for harassment. However, the court found that a prima facie case existed against the applicant and refused to quash the charge-sheet.

The case in question pertains to a wildlife protection case, where the applicant was charged with offences under the Wildlife Protection Act. The applicant's counsel argued that no offence was made out against the applicant and that the prosecution was instituted with a malafide intention for harassment. The counsel further argued that the charge-sheet was filed without any evidence against the applicant and that the prosecution was based on hearsay evidence.

The court, however, found that a prima facie case existed against the applicant and refused to quash the charge-sheet. The court observed that the charge-sheet was filed after a thorough investigation by the Investigating Officer and that there was sufficient evidence to proceed against the applicant. The court also observed that the prosecution was not instituted with a malafide intention for harassment and that the charge-sheet was filed in accordance with the law.

The court directed the applicant to surrender before the court within 30 days and apply for bail. The court also directed that no coercive action would be taken against the applicant during this period. The court observed that the applicant was entitled to bail as a matter of right and that the applicant should be released on bail on the same day of surrender.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the principle that a charge-sheet cannot be quashed merely on the ground that the prosecution was instituted with a malafide intention for harassment. The court's decision also highlights the importance of a thorough investigation by the Investigating Officer before filing a charge-sheet.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a reminder that the law must be followed in letter and spirit, and that the prosecution must be based on evidence and not on hearsay. The court's decision also highlights the importance of a fair and impartial investigation by the Investigating Officer, and the need for the court to ensure that the accused is not harassed or subjected to coercive action during the pendency of the case.
