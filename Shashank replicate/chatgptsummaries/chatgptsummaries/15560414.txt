The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Vakeel Singh Parmar, who had been arrested in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand. The court granted Parmar's bail application, subject to certain conditions.

Parmar was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. In addition, the court imposed several conditions on Parmar, including cooperating in the investigation and trial, refraining from committing a similar offence, and obtaining prior permission from the trial court or Investigating Officer before leaving India.

The case against Parmar involved the illegal transportation of Chambal Sand, which is a type of sand found in the Chambal River basin. This sand is in high demand for construction purposes, and its illegal transportation has become a major issue in the region.

Parmar's arrest was part of a larger crackdown on illegal sand mining and transportation in the area. The authorities have been taking strict action against those involved in these activities, as they have been causing significant damage to the environment and disrupting the local ecosystem.

The court's decision to grant Parmar bail was based on several factors. First, Parmar had no prior criminal record and was not considered a flight risk. Second, he had cooperated with the authorities during the investigation and had provided all necessary information. Finally, the court was satisfied that Parmar would not pose a threat to society if released on bail.

However, the court also recognized the seriousness of the offence and the need to deter others from engaging in similar activities. Therefore, it imposed several conditions on Parmar to ensure that he would not commit a similar offence in the future.

The condition requiring Parmar to cooperate in the investigation and trial was particularly important, as it would help the authorities to gather more evidence and build a stronger case against him. The condition requiring him to obtain prior permission before leaving India was also significant, as it would prevent him from fleeing the country and evading justice.

Overall, the court's decision to grant Parmar bail was a balanced one, taking into account both the seriousness of the offence and the individual circumstances of the accused. The conditions imposed on Parmar were reasonable and necessary to ensure that justice was served and that similar offences were deterred in the future.
