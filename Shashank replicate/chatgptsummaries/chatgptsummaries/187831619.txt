The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board has filed an appeal against the acquittal of M/S Deepak Fertilisers and Petro Chemicals Corporation Ltd. and two of its officers for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The company was accused of discharging polluted water from its factory into the environment, causing environmental hazards. The appeal was filed under Section 378(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The case involves the collection and analysis of effluent samples and the violation of consent conditions.

The court order states that the Appellate Court correctly concluded that the collection of the effluent sample from the accused's factory was doubtful. The effluent treatment plant of the accused was connected to the MIDC's effluent treatment plant, and the charge itself was defective. The complainant had no authority to prosecute the company under Section 24 of the said Act. The prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that they had collected the samples at the extreme end of the drain carrying effluent of the factory. Therefore, the Appellate Court did not commit any error in acquitting the respondent no.1-company.
