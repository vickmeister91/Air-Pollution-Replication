The court order pertains to a case between Smt. Phoolwati and Sh. Ishwar Singh Saini. Phoolwati is the landlady and owner of a property in Delhi, and she has filed a petition seeking eviction of Saini, who is a tenant in one of the shops on the ground floor of the property. Phoolwati claims that the shop is required for her grandson's mobile business. Saini has filed an affidavit for leave to defend, stating that the grounds for eviction are false and frivolous, and that Phoolwati has access to other commercial properties in Delhi. The court has heard both sides and reserved its order.

The court order states that the landlady has sought eviction of the tenant to accommodate her grandson's mobile shop, but the tenant has raised several triable issues and has been regularly paying rent. The court must consider whether the landlady has other reasonably suitable accommodation and whether her bonafide requirement is genuine. The tenant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to counter the landlady's claims, and the court has found that the shop facing the main road is more commercially viable for the mobile shop. The court has allowed the tenant to defend the eviction application.

The court order dismisses the tenant's application for leave to defend and passes an eviction order for the tenanted shop on the ground floor. The court cites previous judgments to establish that the landlord's bonafide requirement for the shop does not need to be dire or compelling, and that the court cannot direct the landlord to do a particular business in a particular area. The court also notes that the landlady is not entitled to possession of the tenanted shop until six months from the date of the order.

The case between Smt. Phoolwati and Sh. Ishwar Singh Saini revolves around the eviction of the latter from a shop he has been renting from the former. The landlady, Phoolwati, has filed a petition seeking eviction of Saini to accommodate her grandson's mobile business. Saini, on the other hand, has filed an affidavit for leave to defend, stating that the grounds for eviction are false and frivolous, and that Phoolwati has access to other commercial properties in Delhi.

The court has heard both sides and reserved its order. In its subsequent order, the court has stated that the landlady has sought eviction of the tenant to accommodate her grandson's mobile shop, but the tenant has raised several triable issues and has been regularly paying rent. The court must consider whether the landlady has other reasonably suitable accommodation and whether her bonafide requirement is genuine.

The tenant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to counter the landlady's claims, and the court has found that the shop facing the main road is more commercially viable for the mobile shop. However, the court has allowed the tenant to defend the eviction application. This means that Saini can continue to occupy the shop until the court makes a final decision on the matter.

In its order, the court has cited previous judgments to establish that the landlord's bonafide requirement for the shop does not need to be dire or compelling. The court has also noted that it cannot direct the landlord to do a particular business in a particular area. This means that the court cannot force Phoolwati to accommodate her grandson's mobile business in the shop in question.

The court has also noted that the landlady is not entitled to possession of the tenanted shop until six months from the date of the order. This is in line with the provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act, which provides for a six-month notice period before a tenant can be evicted.

Overall, the court order in the case between Smt. Phoolwati and Sh. Ishwar Singh Saini has allowed the tenant to defend the eviction application and has cited previous judgments to establish the landlord's bonafide requirement for the shop. The court has also noted that the landlady is not entitled to possession of the tenanted shop until six months from the date of the order.
