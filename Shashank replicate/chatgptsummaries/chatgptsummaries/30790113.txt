The Bihar State Co-operative Milk Producers Federation Limited filed a writ petition against the State of Jharkhand, the Secretary of Industries, the Managing Director of Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority, and M/s Composite Tools Company (India) Limited. The petitioner sought to quash orders cancelling the allotment of unutilized land and forfeiting the value of the land deposited with the Authority. The petitioner also sought a writ in the nature of mandamus commanding the respondents not to give effect to the orders.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately found that the Appellate Authority had made errors in its decision and upheld the order passed by the Managing Director of AIADA. The court order pertains to a writ petition regarding the cancellation of one acre of land allocated to a petitioner for industrial use. The petitioner had planted trees on the land as per the conditions of their 'Consent to Operate' under Pollution Control laws. The appellate authority had upheld the cancellation of the land, citing unutilized land and an error of record. However, the court found that the petitioner had plans for expansion and had already utilized most of the land allocated to them. The court also rejected the argument that developments subsequent to the cancellation order should not be considered. The court allowed the writ petition and set aside the cancellation order.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioner's capacity for processing milk has increased, and there is plantation of trees on the cancelled area of one acre. The court finds that the petitioner is under an obligation to comply with pollution control laws and plant trees as per the terms of the consent order issued by the pollution control board. The court allows the writ petition and quashes the impugned order passed by the Managing Director, Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority, and the appellate order passed by the Secretary, Industries, Government of Jharkhand. The order of allotment of the cancelled portion of land to the Respondent no 4 is also set aside.
