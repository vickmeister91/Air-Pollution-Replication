The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by the Somnath Adivashi Sangathan against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The PIL pertained to the method of disbursal of compensation amount and non-adherence to guidelines for rehabilitation in case of acquisition for the purpose of National Tiger Conservation Authority. The court found that appropriate authorities had taken steps to disburse compensation to affected persons and that those persons had availed of the compensation amount. However, the petitioner's grievance was that compensation was disbursed equally to owners of land and occupants in forest areas, resulting in discrimination.

The court found that the petitioner had not challenged the rehabilitation policy on this count and that the substantive relief claimed in the petition was to give effect to the rehabilitation policy. The court allowed affected persons who claimed to be owners of land in the forest area to pursue their remedy through Legal Services Authority, District Hoshangabad. The court left open the issue of whether the petitioner had approached the court with clean hands and disposed of the petition.
