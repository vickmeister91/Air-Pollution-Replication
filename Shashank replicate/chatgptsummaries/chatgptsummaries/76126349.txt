The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) recently filed a Stay Petition in an attempt to prevent the recovery of outstanding amounts for the assessment years 2009-10 to 2012-13. The petitioner claimed to be a charitable institution and therefore exempt from income tax under Section 10(23C)(iv) of the Income Tax Act. However, the application for approval as a charitable institution was still pending before the Chief Commissioner, and the petitioner was not registered under Section 12AA of the Act.

The TNPCB's Stay Petition was dismissed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which directed the appeals to be posted for final disposal on April 23, 2018. This decision was made due to the fact that the petitioner's claim of being a charitable institution was not yet approved by the Chief Commissioner, and the petitioner was not registered under Section 12AA of the Act.

The Income Tax Act provides for exemptions for charitable institutions, but these exemptions are subject to certain conditions. One of these conditions is that the institution must be registered under Section 12AA of the Act. This registration is necessary to ensure that the institution is actually carrying out charitable activities and is not engaged in any commercial activities.

In this case, the TNPCB claimed to be a charitable institution, but was not registered under Section 12AA of the Act. Additionally, the application for approval as a charitable institution was still pending before the Chief Commissioner. Therefore, the TNPCB was not eligible for the exemption under Section 10(23C)(iv) of the Act.

The TNPCB's attempt to prevent the recovery of outstanding amounts was dismissed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, which directed the appeals to be posted for final disposal on April 23, 2018. This decision was made in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act, which require charitable institutions to be registered under Section 12AA of the Act in order to be eligible for exemptions under Section 10(23C)(iv) of the Act.

In conclusion, the TNPCB's attempt to claim exemption as a charitable institution was dismissed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal due to the fact that the petitioner was not registered under Section 12AA of the Act and the application for approval as a charitable institution was still pending before the Chief Commissioner. The appeals have been directed to be posted for final disposal on April 23, 2018.
