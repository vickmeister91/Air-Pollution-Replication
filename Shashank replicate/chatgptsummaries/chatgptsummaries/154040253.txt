The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the Srinagar Hydro Electric Project and the Alaknanda Hydro Power Project in Uttar Pradesh, India. The Srinagar project had received environmental clearance in 1985, but a challenge was made to the High Court's order to hold a public hearing before the project's completion. The court ultimately set aside the direction for a public hearing, citing the ongoing nature of the project and the fact that environmental clearance had already been granted. However, the court outlined conditions for compliance with environmental clearance and forest clearance, including provisions for preventing indiscriminate falling of trees, undertaking soil conservation programs, afforestation, and establishing fuel wood depots. The court also called for the establishment of a monitoring committee to oversee the project's implementation and compliance with safeguards.

The court order also discussed the construction of the Dhari Devi Temple and the controversy surrounding it. The order rejected the idea of constructing a well to protect the temple and instead recommended raising the temple on a concrete platform. The order also discussed the importance of dam safety and the need for proper surveillance, inspection, operation, and maintenance of dams to ensure their safe functioning. The expert committees endorsed the view that raising the temple to a higher place would not violate the rights guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution.

The Alaknanda Hydro Power Project had initially been approved for 200 MW, but later increased to 330 MW. The Ministry of Environment and Forest granted environmental clearance for the project subject to certain safeguards. The project involved diversion of forest land and construction of a concrete gravity dam. The project was later transferred to Alaknanda Hydro Power Co. Ltd. (AHPCL), who sought transfer of the environmental clearance granted to the project. The court directed AHPCL to approach the Ministry of Environment for a specific decision on clearance for increased capacity and height of the dam. The Ministry clarified that the transfer of environmental clearance to AHPCL was for 330 MW capacity. The court ordered AHPCL to place documents before the Ministry and hold a public hearing. The construction work had progressed to a great extent, and the court did not stop the construction, subject to the decision taken by the Ministry.

The court order also required AHPCL to maintain a minimum environmental flow as decided by the Ministry based on a study by IIT Roorkee. AHPCL must release a minimum of 5 cumecs of water from the dam throughout the year in the river section of water. AHPCL must seek clearances for the Alaknanda River Front Development Scheme and submit a detailed action plan with time targets along with a bank guarantee of Rs.1 crore. The committee recommended restoring muck disposal sites, expediting catchment area treatment and green belt plans, creating an effective monitoring mechanism, and completing ongoing construction activities. The report is being questioned by MoEF due to objections regarding the proposal to shift Dhari Devi temple to a higher place, which could wound the religious feelings of Hindus.

The court received responses from the Principal Secretary and State of Uttarakhand, the Forest Department of Uttarakhand, and the second respondent regarding the non-compliance of various directions given by the MoEF. Dr. B. Jhunjhunwala suggested that the temple could be saved by making a canal instead of a reservoir at the impugned project and by constructing a dry well of sufficient height and diameter around the sacred rock. The State of Uttarakhand accepted the B.P. Das Committee Report and the report submitted by the Joint Team. The court found that the proposal made by INTACH for the restoration of Dhari Devi Temple should be accepted. The court also found that both proposals for protecting the sacred rock in situ were not feasible.

The court emphasized the importance of dam safety and security to prevent environmental disasters and loss of human life and property. The Central Water Commission is responsible for ensuring proper surveillance, inspection, operation, and maintenance of dams. The court also addressed concerns about muck management and disposal, catchment area treatment, and green belt development. The court expressed concern about the impact of hydroelectric projects on the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins and called for further scientific examination of the cumulative impact of all project components. The court allowed the hydroelectric project in question to proceed but urged compliance with all recommendations made by the Joint Team.

Finally, the court order discussed the adverse impact of hydroelectric power projects on the ecology and environment of Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins. The court directed the MoEF and State of Uttarakhand not to grant any further environmental clearance or forest clearance for any hydroelectric power project in the state until further orders. The MoEF is directed to constitute an expert body to make a detailed study on the impact of existing and under-construction hydroelectric power projects on the environment and ecology. The Disaster Management Authority, Uttarakhand, is directed to submit a report on the effectiveness of their disaster management plan in combating the tragedy that occurred in Uttarakhand in June 2013. The reports are to be submitted within three months.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the Srinagar Hydro Electric Project and the Alaknanda Hydro Power Project in Uttar Pradesh, India. The court outlined conditions for compliance with environmental clearance and forest clearance, including provisions for preventing indiscriminate falling of trees, undertaking soil conservation programs,
