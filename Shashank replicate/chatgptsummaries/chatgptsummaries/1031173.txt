In a recent court order, the issue at hand was the production, inspection, or supply of copies of documents seized by the police during an investigation. The accused had demanded access to these documents, which had not been supplied to them under Section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The court held that even at the stage of considering the framing of charges, the accused is entitled to demand the production of a document if it has any bearing on the question of framing of charges, even if the prosecution may not rely on the same.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that both parties have access to all relevant information in a case. The court noted that the accused has a right to a fair trial, and that denying them access to relevant documents could prejudice their defense. The court also observed that the prosecution has a duty to disclose all relevant documents to the accused, and that failure to do so could result in the trial being declared unfair.

In this particular case, the accused had requested access to documents that had been seized by the police during the investigation. The court noted that these documents could have a bearing on the question of framing of charges, and therefore directed the investigating agency to produce the remaining 31 seized cheques for inspection by the accused persons or their lawyers.

The court's decision is significant because it reinforces the principle of natural justice and ensures that both parties have access to all relevant information in a case. It also highlights the importance of the prosecution's duty to disclose all relevant documents to the accused, and the consequences of failing to do so.

Overall, the court's order serves as a reminder that the right to a fair trial is a fundamental right, and that all parties must be given access to all relevant information in a case. The court's decision in this case ensures that the accused have a fair chance to defend themselves and that justice is served.
