A court order has been issued in a case where four accused have been sent for trial for offenses under the Copyright Act and IPC. The prosecution claims that the accused were involved in the infringement of copyright and piracy of music and films. The accused include employees and directors of a company called M/s Sidharth Optical Disc Pvt. Ltd. The court has examined the evidence and found that a prima facie case exists against the accused, and therefore, charges have been framed against them. The court has also clarified the law regarding considerations at the stage of charge.

The court order states that when framing charges, the judge should not weigh the evidence as if conducting a trial, but should accept the materials on record as true. The court should only consider whether there is strong suspicion that the accused has committed an offense. The order also explains that a person can be held liable for an offense committed by a company if they were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business at the time of the offense. The order goes on to discuss the arguments made by each accused and concludes that there is sufficient evidence to frame charges against all three accused under the Copyright Act and IPC.

The court order pertains to charges under the Copyright Act and IPC against accused Devesh Kumar Rathore and Surender Wadhwa. The defense argued that charges against Wadhwa were not made out, but the court rejected these arguments. The court also discussed the vicarious liability of a managing director of a company and held that if material suggests that Wadhwa was a managing director, there would be a presumption that he was in charge of and responsible for the business of the company. The court also noted that the burden of proof is on the accused to show that the offense was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent it. The court found evidence that Wadhwa was actively taking part in the affairs of the company after a certain date, and therefore, he could be held vicariously liable.

The court order discusses the liability of accused Surender Wadhwa for the offenses committed by the company M/s. Sidharth Optical Disc under the Copyright Act, 1957. The court cites various letters and witness statements suggesting Wadhwa's involvement in procuring orders for the company. The court also discusses the legal fiction under Section 69(2) of the Act, which makes Wadhwa liable for the company's actions. The court rejects the accused's argument that only the company can be prosecuted and not its directors. The court also notes that the company needs to be proceeded against for the offenses committed. Finally, the court discusses the issue of mandatory imprisonment for graver offenses and opines that the legislative intent is not to give complete immunity to corporate bodies for serious offenses.

The court order discusses the ability to prosecute companies for offenses involving an amount or value of more than Rs. one lakh. The court cannot impose imprisonment on a company, but can impose fines. The court also discusses the issue of vicarious liability for managing directors or directors of a company. The court orders charges to be framed against the accused and the company for copyright infringement. The court also discusses the definition of forgery and the lack of evidence for charges under IPC sections 468 and 471 against one of the accused. The court concludes that there is sufficient evidence to frame charges against all four accused for copyright infringement.

The court order pertains to the case of Jitender Gulati and others who were charged under FIR No. 243/02/PS Mayapuri/U.S.63 of Copyright Act, 1957. The order was issued on 1.7.2009 and is the final page (23) of the document.
