The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Chayaprakash against M/S Reliaable Lakeshore and others. The petitioner had filed a complaint against the respondents for an offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act). The petitioner had also filed an application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act seeking permission to lead secondary evidence, which was rejected by the court.

The case revolved around a cheque issued by the respondents to the petitioner, which was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The petitioner claimed that he had repeatedly requested the respondents to make the payment, but they had failed to do so. The respondents, on the other hand, claimed that they had already made the payment and that the petitioner was falsely accusing them.

During the course of the trial, the petitioner sought permission to lead secondary evidence in the form of a photocopy of the cheque, as the original cheque was not available. The respondents objected to this, stating that the petitioner had not made sufficient efforts to produce the original cheque and that the photocopy was not admissible as evidence.

The learned Magistrate agreed with the respondents and rejected the petitioner's application for permission to lead secondary evidence. The petitioner then filed a criminal petition before the court, challenging the Magistrate's order.

The court, after hearing both parties, found no illegality committed by the learned Magistrate in rejecting the petitioner's application for permission to lead secondary evidence. The court noted that the petitioner had not made sufficient efforts to produce the original cheque and that the photocopy was not admissible as evidence. The court also observed that the respondents had raised valid objections to the admissibility of the photocopy.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the criminal petition filed by the petitioner. The court's decision was based on the principle that secondary evidence can only be admitted in court if the original document is not available despite reasonable efforts to produce it. The court also emphasized the importance of ensuring that evidence presented in court is reliable and admissible.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following proper procedures and presenting reliable evidence in court. It also serves as a reminder that secondary evidence can only be admitted in exceptional circumstances and that parties must make reasonable efforts to produce the original document before seeking permission to lead secondary evidence.
