The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri R. Shankarappa against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner challenged a notice issued by the third respondent, calling upon him to produce documents to show that he had obtained prior approval of the Central Government for doing non-forest activity in the land stated to be forest land measuring 5 acres at Sy.No.21 (re-numbered as Sy.No.54) of Kenchanahalli Village, Kengeri Hobli, Bangalore South Taluk.

The court quashed the notice on several grounds, including that it was issued without considering the materials placed on the record of the respondent No.3. The court order states that the petitioner has purchased lands and got them converted for non-agricultural purposes. The government cannot de-settle the settled conditions without a prima facie cause. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 cannot be applied to this case as the land was released from the forest area much before the act came into force.

The court also mentions that a statute cannot be given retrospective application unless the legislature has expressly provided for it. The government has not taken any steps to invalidate the sale transactions and has only issued a notice to the petitioner, which is violative of the right to equality. The court quashes the notice and states that it cannot be issued based on the materials placed on the record.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rights of landowners who have purchased land and converted it for non-agricultural purposes. The government cannot arbitrarily issue notices without a prima facie cause and cannot apply laws retrospectively unless the legislature has expressly provided for it.

The court's decision is based on several grounds, including the fact that the land in question was released from the forest area much before the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 came into force.

The court's decision is significant as it protects the rights of landowners who have purchased land and converted it for non-agricultural purposes.

In conclusion, the court order quashing the notice issued by the third respondent is a significant decision that upholds the rights of landowners who have purchased land and converted it for non-agricultural purposes.
