The court order in question pertains to three criminal miscellaneous petitions filed by Jang Bhadur Singh against Ramrati and Saroj Devi. The petitioner had requested the court to take on record an alleged document related to a loan, which was rejected by the lower court. The petitioner argued that the complainant had mentioned the stamp paper of Rs. 100 executed for the loan in their cross-examination, but the petitioner had earlier stated that no such stamp paper was executed.

The court dismissed the petitions, stating that since the petitioner had mentioned that no stamp paper was executed, there was no question of summoning it from the complainant. The court also stated that the trial court had not committed any illegality in rejecting the petitioner's application.

The case at hand revolves around a dispute over a loan, and the admissibility of a document related to it. The petitioner, Jang Bhadur Singh, had requested the court to take on record an alleged document related to the loan, which had been rejected by the lower court. Singh argued that the complainant had mentioned the stamp paper of Rs. 100 executed for the loan in their cross-examination, but Singh had earlier stated that no such stamp paper was executed.

The court dismissed Singh's petitions, stating that since he had mentioned that no stamp paper was executed, there was no question of summoning it from the complainant. The court also stated that the trial court had not committed any illegality in rejecting Singh's application.

This ruling highlights the importance of consistency in legal proceedings. If a party makes a statement that contradicts their earlier statements or evidence, it can weaken their case and lead to their petitions being dismissed. In this case, Singh's earlier statement that no stamp paper was executed undermined his argument that the document in question should be admitted as evidence.

It is also worth noting that the court upheld the lower court's decision to reject Singh's application. This suggests that the lower court's decision was sound and based on legal principles. It is important for courts to follow established legal procedures and principles to ensure fair and just outcomes.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of consistency and adherence to legal principles in legal proceedings. It also highlights the role of the courts in upholding these principles and ensuring fair outcomes for all parties involved.
