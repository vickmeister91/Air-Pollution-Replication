The case in question involves a criminal petition filed by the petitioner to set aside an order passed by the Additional Civil Judge and JMFC Devanahalli on an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. in C.C. No.965/2013. The petitioner is the complainant in a case where criminal proceedings were initiated against the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

The respondent had filed an application seeking a direction to the complainant to produce an unregistered mortgage deed. The learned Magistrate allowed the application, but the High Court found the order to be not judicious and set it aside.

The issue at hand is whether the order passed by the learned Magistrate was correct in allowing the respondent's application for the production of an unregistered mortgage deed. The petitioner argues that the order was not judicious and should be set aside, while the respondent argues that the order was correct and should be upheld.

The High Court, in its decision, noted that the respondent had not made out a case for the production of the unregistered mortgage deed. The Court held that the respondent had not shown how the unregistered mortgage deed was relevant to the case and how it would assist in the just decision of the case.

The Court further noted that the respondent had not made any effort to obtain the unregistered mortgage deed through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the complainant or by filing a civil suit for specific performance. The Court held that the respondent could not seek the production of the unregistered mortgage deed through the criminal proceedings.

The Court also noted that the order passed by the learned Magistrate was not judicious as it did not consider the relevance of the unregistered mortgage deed to the case. The Court held that the order was passed without proper application of mind and was therefore liable to be set aside.

In conclusion, the High Court set aside the order passed by the learned Magistrate allowing the respondent's application for the production of an unregistered mortgage deed. The Court held that the respondent had not made out a case for the production of the unregistered mortgage deed and that the order passed by the learned Magistrate was not judicious. The Court further held that the respondent could not seek the production of the unregistered mortgage deed through the criminal proceedings and that the order was liable to be set aside.
