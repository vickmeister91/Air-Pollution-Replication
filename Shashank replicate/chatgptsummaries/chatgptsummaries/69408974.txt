The Supreme Court of India has issued several court orders related to the impact of mining activities on the environment in various regions of the country. One of the orders examined the impact of mining activity on the environment within a 5km radius of the Delhi-Haryana border on the Haryana side of the ridge and in the Aravalli hills. The court considered compliance with conditions imposed by pollution boards and statutory provisions, as well as obtaining clearances and permissions from authorities before starting mining operations. The court directed the government of Haryana to stop all mining activities and pumping of groundwater in and from an area up to 5km from the Delhi-Haryana border in the Haryana side of the ridge and also in the Aravalli Hills. The Environmental Pollution Central Authority (EPCA) was directed to give a report with regard to the environment in the area. The EPCA found evidence of clear violation of some of the key conditions of the court's order.

Another court order described violations of environmental regulations at mining sites in the Anangpur area and its vicinity, including the continuation of mining after reaching the groundwater level, misuse of precious groundwater, and lack of adherence to environmental management plans. The order also notes the absence of compliance and enforcement by various agencies, including failure to adhere to green belt requirements and obtain necessary clearances. The impact on groundwater reserves is also discussed, with conflicting opinions from the government and the Central Ground Water Board.

The court order discusses the impact of mining on groundwater reserves in the Aravalli hills of NCT Delhi, Faridabad, and Gurgaon Districts of Haryana. The Central Ground Water Board found that mining has led to a depletion of groundwater resources and that the mined water is not being pumped into abandoned pits for recharge, but instead discharged into surrounding nalas, causing wastage of groundwater. The report recommends a ban on mining activities and pumping of groundwater in the area, rejuvenation of the local economy through plantations and local water harvesting, and tighter monitoring of the area by a Central Government agency. The note by the Chairmen of the Central Ground Water Board also highlights the decline in groundwater levels during mining and the rise in levels after stoppage of pumping.

The court order discusses the impact of mining on ground water resources in the Aravalli hills area. The discharge of water from mines is causing enormous losses to ground water resources, and the high silt content of the water makes it difficult to recharge effectively. The decline of ground water levels in the area has been attributed to overdevelopment of ground water for domestic and industrial uses. The Central Ground Water Authority has imposed regulatory measures on ground water development in certain areas. The report also includes observations from inspections of 26 mines, including details on the mineral extracted, status of mining, and environmental clearances.

The court order describes the inspection of various mines in Faridabad and Gurgaon, including their location, area, mineral extraction, groundwater status, environmental clearances, and observed mining activity. The report highlights the impact of mining on the groundwater regime in the region, which is being exploited and destroyed. The report also notes that most of the mining is happening inside the municipal area of Faridabad, and the sensitivity of the region is further accentuated by its close proximity to ecologically sensitive areas. The report concludes that mining is destroying a non-renewable resource and recommends measures to avoid adverse environmental impacts on groundwater regimes.

The court order discusses the environmental impact of mining activities in the Aravalli hills range, which is ecologically sensitive and close to reserved forests and other sensitive areas. The report recommends strict regulatory measures for groundwater use and expresses concern about the serious implications for the groundwater reserve, which is the only source of drinking water in the area. The court reaffirms earlier recommendations to stop mining activities in the area and prohibits all mining activities and pumping of groundwater within 5 km of the Delhi-Haryana border in the Haryana side of the Ridge and also in the Aravalli Hills. The court also discusses notifications regarding mining on the Aravalli Hills and the delegation of powers to state governments. The court also discusses a notification regarding environmental clearance for new projects and the interpretation of the notification's applicability to mining leases granted earlier.

The court order pertains to a notification issued on January 27, 1994, which requires environmental clearance for any new project or expansion of an existing industry listed in Schedule I. The notification also applies to mining leases granted earlier, including at the time of renewal. The order outlines the requirements and procedures for seeking environmental clearance, including the submission of an Environmental Impact Assessment Report. The order also establishes a Committee of Experts to evaluate and assess the reports submitted with the application. The order emphasizes the mandatory nature of the notification and the need for compliance before any mining activity can be permitted. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) was constituted to monitor compliance with the court's orders, including those related to mining activity.

The court order states that no mining activity can be carried out without remedial measures taking place and environmental impact assessment must be done before any mining activity can be permitted. The Central Empowered Committee has suggested various measures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, including obtaining environmental clearances, cancelling mining leases in areas where plantations have been raised with foreign funding, and imposing penalties for non-compliance. The court emphasizes the fundamental right to live in a pollution-free environment and the duty of citizens and the state to protect and improve the
