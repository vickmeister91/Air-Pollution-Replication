The case at hand involves Mohd Asif Iqbal, who is facing charges under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. He has filed a criminal application against the State of Maharashtra, as he is apprehending arrest. The court has ordered both the respondents to submit a report by September 18, 2018. This report will likely contain information regarding the charges against Iqbal and the evidence against him.

In the meantime, the court has granted Iqbal some relief. If he is arrested, he can be released on a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 15,000 with one or two sureties. This means that he will not have to pay any money upfront to secure his release, but he will need to provide one or two people who are willing to vouch for him and ensure that he appears in court when required.

The court has also ordered Iqbal to attend the office of respondent No.1 on September 15, 16, and 17, 2018. It is unclear what the purpose of this attendance is, but it may be related to the investigation into the charges against him.

The matter is listed for further consideration on September 18, 2018. At this time, the court will likely review the report submitted by the respondents and make a decision regarding Iqbal's case. It is possible that he will be granted further relief or that he will be required to face the charges against him in court.

Overall, this court order provides some temporary relief for Mohd Asif Iqbal, who is facing charges under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. While he is still at risk of arrest, he can be released on a personal recognizance bond if he is taken into custody.
