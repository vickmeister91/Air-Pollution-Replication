The case of Ganga Ram vs State of U.P. involved a petitioner who had been in jail since October 2009 in connection with a case related to the Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act. The petitioner's counsel argued for parity with co-accused who had already been granted bail, which was not disputed by the state counsel. The court granted bail to the petitioner and ordered his release upon filing a personal bond and two sureties.

The Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act are two important pieces of legislation in India that aim to protect the country's forests and wildlife. The Forest Act, which was enacted in 1927, provides for the conservation of forests and the regulation of forest produce. The Wildlife Protection Act, which was enacted in 1972, provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and their habitats.

In the case of Ganga Ram, it is not clear what specific charges the petitioner was facing under these Acts. However, it is likely that the charges were related to the illegal felling of trees or the poaching of wildlife. These are serious offenses that can result in significant fines and imprisonment.

The petitioner's counsel argued that his client should be granted bail on the grounds of parity with co-accused who had already been granted bail. This argument is based on the principle of equality before the law, which is enshrined in the Indian Constitution. The state counsel did not dispute this argument, which suggests that there was no compelling reason to keep the petitioner in jail while his co-accused were out on bail.

The court granted bail to the petitioner upon filing a personal bond and two sureties. A personal bond is a written promise to appear in court when required, while a surety is a person who agrees to pay a certain amount of money if the accused fails to appear in court. These conditions are standard for granting bail in India and are designed to ensure that the accused does not flee or tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner is significant because it acknowledges the principle of parity and ensures that the petitioner is not unfairly detained while his co-accused are out on bail. It also highlights the importance of the Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act in protecting India's natural resources and wildlife.

Overall, the case of Ganga Ram vs State of U.P. is an important example of how the Indian legal system works to protect the rights of citizens and ensure that justice is served. The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner is a positive step towards ensuring that the principles of equality and fairness are upheld in all legal proceedings.
