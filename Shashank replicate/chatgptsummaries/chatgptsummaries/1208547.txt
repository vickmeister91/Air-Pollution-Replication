The court order pertains to two separate cases related to mining leases granted by the government. The first case involves a writ appeal filed by Sri B. Kumar Gouda against M/S Sathavahana Ispat Limited. The appeal challenges an interim order passed by a single judge in 2007, which stayed the mining lease executed by the government in favor of the third respondent. The court found that the application filed by the writ petitioner seeking a mining lease was pending cancellation, and the lease granted to the third respondent overlapped with the petitioner's claim. The court rejected the third respondent's contention that their application was rejected by operation of law and found no evidence of fraud or collusion in the events leading to the dismissal of the petitioner's application.

The court noted that the petitioner had filed an application for a mining lease, which was pending cancellation at the time the government granted the lease to the third respondent. The court found that the lease granted to the third respondent overlapped with the petitioner's claim and therefore, the interim order staying the mining lease was justified. The court also rejected the third respondent's argument that their application was rejected by operation of law, finding no evidence to support this claim.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a case filed by Shivakumar in connection with a mining lease granted by the government. The court notes that the petitioner did not respond to the hearing and failed to pursue the case after remand. The court finds no prima facie case for granting interim relief and allows the appeal filed by the respondent. The court also notes that the observations made in the order are limited to the consideration of the interim relief sought by the petitioner.

The court found that the petitioner had failed to respond to the hearing and had not pursued the case after remand. The court therefore found no prima facie case for granting interim relief and allowed the appeal filed by the respondent. The court also noted that its observations were limited to the consideration of the interim relief sought by the petitioner.

In both cases, the court was tasked with determining the validity of mining leases granted by the government. In the first case, the court found that the lease granted to the third respondent overlapped with the petitioner's claim and therefore, the interim order staying the mining lease was justified. In the second case, the court found that the petitioner had failed to pursue the case and therefore, no interim relief could be granted.

Overall, the court's orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures when applying for mining leases and pursuing legal cases. The court's decisions also underscore the need for transparency and fairness in the allocation of mining leases by the government.
