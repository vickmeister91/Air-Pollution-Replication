The Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the Sabarimala shrine in Kerala, filed an application in court seeking directions to the Ministry of Environmental and Forest, Union of India, to consider and pass orders on their application to raise the height of Kunnar weir. The purpose of this is to augment water supply to the Sabarimala shrine. The court had previously found the necessity for increasing the height of the weir and that nearly 250 Sq.mts of forest land is likely to be submerged.

The court directed the Ministry to take up the application and pass appropriate orders within three months. The Devaswom Board was also directed to provide all clarifications sought by the Ministry without delay. The court's decision was based on the fact that the Sabarimala shrine is a major pilgrimage site, and the increase in water supply is necessary to ensure the comfort and safety of the pilgrims.

The Kunnar weir is a small dam located in the Periyar river, which is the main source of water for the Sabarimala shrine. The weir was constructed in the 1970s to regulate the flow of water to the shrine. However, due to the increase in the number of pilgrims visiting the shrine, the water supply has become inadequate. The Devaswom Board had proposed to raise the height of the weir by 3 meters to increase the water storage capacity.

The court's decision was welcomed by the Devaswom Board, which had been struggling to get the Ministry to consider their application. The Board had argued that the increase in water supply was necessary to ensure the comfort and safety of the pilgrims. The court's decision is expected to expedite the process of getting the necessary approvals from the Ministry.

The court's decision was also criticized by environmentalists, who argued that the increase in the height of the weir would lead to the submergence of nearly 250 Sq.mts of forest land. They argued that this would have a negative impact on the ecology of the area and would also affect the livelihoods of the local communities.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the increase in water supply was necessary to ensure the comfort and safety of the pilgrims. However, the court also directed the Devaswom Board to provide all clarifications sought by the Ministry without delay. This indicates that the court is aware of the environmental concerns and is taking steps to ensure that the necessary precautions are taken.

In conclusion, the court's decision to direct the Ministry of Environmental and Forest, Union of India, to consider and pass orders on the Devaswom Board's application to raise the height of Kunnar weir is a significant development. The decision is expected to expedite the process of getting the necessary approvals from the Ministry and ensure that the water supply to the Sabarimala shrine is increased. However, the decision has also raised concerns among environmentalists, who argue that the increase in the height of the weir would have a negative impact on the ecology of the area. The court's direction to the Devaswom Board to provide all clarifications sought by the Ministry without delay indicates that the court is aware of these concerns and is taking steps to ensure that the necessary precautions are taken.
