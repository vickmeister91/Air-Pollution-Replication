The court order pertains to the rights of forest dwellers in Kerala and their resettlement. The order is a result of two separate writ petitions filed by Kuttan Gopalan and Shaji Payyanikkal against the Union of India, the State of Kerala, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, and various forest and tribal development departments. The court heard the petitions on March 6, 2019, and delivered a ruling on the same day.

The content of the petitions and the ruling are not provided in the summary. However, it is clear that the court heard two writ petitions involving the Mannan Community, a Scheduled Tribe Community in Kerala, who were occupying an area in the Malayattoor Division of the reserved forest. The State Government assured them that, on surrender of the 938 acres where they were settled, they would be rehabilitated at Pooyamkutty and Kandanpara.

The court declared that forest rights were to be conferred on the forest dwellers, free of the requirement of paying the Net Present Value and cost of Compensatory afforestation. The State Government submitted a working plan for the Malayattoor Division for the period from 2015-16 to 2024-25, which obtained the approval of the Central Government in the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The Central Government insisted on a further permission for giving effect to the rehabilitation proposals that were already included in the working plan that was approved by the Central Government, pursuant to the directions in Ext.P2 judgment.

The court recognizes the proposal for resettlement of forest dwellers and directs the State Government to proceed with the proposals indicated in Ext.P8 proposal. The court also quashes the directions in Ext.P9 communication of the Central Government dated 15.3.2018 as they were unwarranted. The court permits the State Government to carry out felling of trees in the 15 cent plots already identified by them for construction of houses and allied structures for the families to be resettled.

The court also directs the State Government to consider the felling of balance trees only after first ascertaining the nature of activities proposed to be carried out by the resettled forest dwellers in the areas allocated to each of them. The court order includes exhibits and copies of letters related to a proposed modification of a working plan and the living conditions of petitioners and members of a colony. It also includes a copy of a government order and a letter related to the case. There are no exhibits from the respondents.

In summary, the court order pertains to the rights of forest dwellers in Kerala and their resettlement. The court recognizes the proposal for resettlement of forest dwellers and directs the State Government to proceed with the proposals indicated in Ext.P8 proposal. The court also quashes the directions in Ext.P9 communication of the Central Government dated 15.3.2018 as they were unwarranted.
