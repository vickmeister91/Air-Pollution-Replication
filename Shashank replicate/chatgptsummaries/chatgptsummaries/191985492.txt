The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner's land was damaged due to the construction of a highway by the respondent No. 5. The petitioner sought compensation for the loss suffered due to the damage caused to his land. The court observed that the respondent No. 5 was liable to compensate the petitioner for the damage caused due to negligence and the doctrine of strict liability would also be applicable in this case. The court cited the case of Rylands vs. Fletcher and the concept of 'No fault liability' or strict liability was enunciated. The court also noted that compensation can be awarded in Article 226 proceedings.

The court order states that proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India allow courts to make appropriate orders, including directions to pay damages or compensation. The court cites a previous case where the liability of an electricity board to compensate for injuries suffered cannot be denied on the basis of safety measures taken, as the liability is strict. The court orders the constitution of a special committee to assess and quantify the damage caused by the dumping of earth and debris into the land of the petitioner, and directs the committee to submit a report by February 4, 2020. The court also orders a copy of the order to be supplied to the respondent for compliance and necessary action.

The concept of strict liability was first enunciated in the case of Rylands vs. Fletcher. In this case, the defendant had constructed a reservoir on his land, which was adjacent to the plaintiff's land. The reservoir was constructed in a negligent manner, and as a result, water from the reservoir flooded the plaintiff's mine, causing damage. The court held that the defendant was liable for the damage caused, even though he had not acted intentionally or negligently. The court held that the defendant had brought something onto his land which was likely to do mischief if it escaped, and he was therefore liable for the damage caused.

The respondent No. 5 had constructed a highway in a negligent manner, which had caused damage to the petitioner's land. The court held that the respondent No. 5 was liable to compensate the petitioner for the damage caused due to negligence.

The court also noted that compensation can be awarded in Article 226 proceedings.

The court can make appropriate orders, including directions to pay damages or compensation, in proceedings under Article 226.

The electricity board argued that it had taken all necessary safety measures, and therefore, it was not liable to compensate the plaintiff. The court held that the liability of the electricity board was strict, and it was liable to compensate the plaintiff for the injuries suffered.
