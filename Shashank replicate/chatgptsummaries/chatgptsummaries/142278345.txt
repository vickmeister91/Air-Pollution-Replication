The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Sri Betta Jayaram Bhat against Pramod Shetty. Bhat had sought to quash an order passed by the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangalore, in Crl.Rp.No.2/13 at Annexure-A, which had confirmed the order passed by the Civil Judge and JMFC, Sullia in C.C.No.967/11 dated 10.12.2012 at Annexure-B, on application filed by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C.

The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking production of certain documents from the respondent. The respondent had objected to the application, stating that the documents were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner was seeking to harass him. The lower court had dismissed the application, stating that the documents were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner had not made out a case for their production.

The petitioner had then filed a revision petition before the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangalore, challenging the order of the lower court. The II Additional District and Sessions Judge had confirmed the order of the lower court, stating that the documents were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner had not made out a case for their production.

The petitioner had then filed a criminal petition before the High Court of Karnataka, seeking to quash the order of the II Additional District and Sessions Judge. The High Court had heard the arguments of both parties and had dismissed the petition as withdrawn.

The court order is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is subject to the condition that the documents are relevant to the case. The court has also reiterated that the power to order the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is discretionary and that the court may refuse to order the production of documents if it is satisfied that the application is made for the purpose of vexation or harassment.

In this case, the court found that the documents sought by the petitioner were not relevant to the case and that the petitioner had not made out a case for their production. The court also noted that the respondent had objected to the application, stating that the petitioner was seeking to harass him. The court therefore upheld the order of the lower court and the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, stating that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the documents.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder that the power to order the production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. is discretionary and that the court will only order the production of documents if it is satisfied that the documents are relevant to the case and that the application is not made for the purpose of vexation or harassment.
