The first condition imposed by the court is that the petitioner must furnish cash security of Rs.25,000/- and a bail bond of Rs. 25,000/- with two sureties of the same amount each. This is a standard requirement for granting bail in criminal cases, and is intended to ensure that the accused appears before the court for trial.

The second condition imposed by the court is that the petitioner must cooperate with the investigation. This means that he must provide any information or evidence that may be required by the Investigating Officer, and must appear before the officer when required. Failure to comply with this condition may result in the cancellation of the petitioner's bail.

Anticipatory bail is a provision in Indian law that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of being arrested. This is typically done when the person believes that he or she may be arrested on false or frivolous charges. Anticipatory bail is granted by the court on the condition that the person cooperates with the investigation and appears before the Investigating Officer when required.

The petitioner has denied any involvement in the illegal activity and has expressed his willingness to cooperate with the investigation.

It is important to note that anticipatory bail is not a guarantee that the person will not be arrested. It simply means that the person can seek bail in advance, and that the court may grant bail if it is satisfied that the person is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner, Shivam Kumar, in connection with a case of illegal mining.
