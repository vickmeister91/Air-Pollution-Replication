To understand the court order, it is important to first understand the background of the case. Shravan Patel had filed a criminal complaint against Siddharth Patel, Himmat Lal Shah, Dr. N.K. Bansal, and Dinesh Kumar Tiwari alleging the offence of cheating and creation of forged/false/fake/fabricated codicils. The trial court had dismissed the complaint, but the complainant filed a criminal revision before the 8th Additional Sessions Judge, who remanded the complaint back to the trial court.

In this context, Shravan Patel filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to produce the original codicils. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The applicant argued that the original codicils were necessary to prove the allegations of cheating and creation of forged/false/fake/fabricated codicils.

However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the applicant had ample opportunity to file the application before the trial court. The court noted that the applicant had not produced any evidence to show that the original codicils were not available at the time of the trial. The court also observed that the applicant had not explained why he had not filed the application earlier.

The court order raises several important legal issues. Firstly, it highlights the importance of timely filing of applications under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that the applicant had ample opportunity to file the application before the trial court, but had failed to do so. This underscores the need for litigants to be diligent in pursuing their cases and filing necessary applications in a timely manner.

Secondly, the court order raises questions about the admissibility of secondary evidence in criminal cases. The applicant had argued that the original codicils were necessary to prove the allegations of cheating and creation of forged/false/fake/fabricated codicils. However, the court dismissed the application, indicating that the applicant had not produced any evidence to show that the original codicils were not available at the time of the trial. This suggests that the court may have been willing to consider secondary evidence if the applicant had been able to demonstrate that the original codicils were not available.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application filed by Shravan Patel under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the application, stating that the applicant had ample opportunity to file the application before the trial court. The court order raises important legal issues related to the timely filing of applications and the admissibility of secondary evidence in criminal cases.
