The court order in question pertains to a revision petition against the dismissal of an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner had requested the summoning and production of certain documents, which the trial court found to be irrelevant and unnecessary at that stage. The court examined the legal position of Sections 227 and 228 of the Code, which deal with the power of the court to frame charges against the accused. The court held that the test is whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction.

The court also examined Section 91 of the Code, which allows for the production of documents or things if necessary or desirable for an inquiry or trial. The court held that the discretion to order production must be exercised judicially and only after the court is satisfied that the thing or document is relevant to the inquiry. The jurisdiction to order production of a document comes into play after the court decides that it is necessary or desirable for the inquiry.

The court rejected the petitioner's application to produce certain documents, stating that they were not relevant at this stage of the trial and that the application was merely an attempt to delay proceedings. The court held that the guilt or innocence of the accused would be determined during the trial, and not at the time of framing the charge. The court also stated that whether a particular document should be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of the trial court.

The revision petition was dismissed.
