The court order in question concerns a dispute over a mortgage deed that was executed on January 8, 1909. The defendant in the case had applied for attachment of the property before judgment, which was granted. While the attachment was in force, the property was mortgaged to the plaintiff. Ultimately, the defendant's suit was decreed, and a share of the property was sold to the defendant in execution of the decree. However, the plaintiff's claim was dismissed on the grounds that the mortgage deed was executed while the attachment was subsisting and was therefore void.

The court's decision was based on several key factors. First, the court held that the attachment before judgment continued until the defendant's remedy was absolutely barred. This means that the attachment remained in force until the defendant's right to seek a remedy had expired. Second, the court found that Order XXI Rule 57 did not apply to attachments before judgment. This rule governs the sale of attached property, but it only applies to attachments that are made after a judgment has been entered.

Based on these findings, the court upheld the lower court's decision and dismissed the plaintiff's appeal with costs. In essence, the court found that the plaintiff's claim was invalid because the mortgage deed was executed while the attachment was still in force. This meant that the plaintiff did not have a valid claim to the property, and the defendant's right to the property was upheld.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of attachments before judgment. In this case, the plaintiff's claim was dismissed because they did not follow the proper procedures for executing a mortgage deed while an attachment was in force. As such, it is crucial for individuals and businesses to seek legal advice before taking any actions that could impact their legal rights and obligations. By doing so, they can avoid costly mistakes and ensure that their interests are protected in any legal disputes that may arise.
