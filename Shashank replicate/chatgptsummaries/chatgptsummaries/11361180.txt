The court order discussed in this article pertains to a petition filed by Gurmeet Ram Rahim seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Special Judicial Magistrate, CBI Haryana at Panchkula. The order dismissed his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for supplying the material documents collected by the Central Bureau of Investigation during the course of investigation, including statements of the witnesses under Section 161 Cr.P.C, which are not part of the charge sheet/final report/challan. The petitioner had sought the copies of statements of a total of 122 witnesses, which were not relied upon by the Investigating Agency while filing the final report.

The court examined the applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C and held that in case any court or any officer in-charge of the police station considers that the production of any document is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the code by or before such Court or officer, such Court may issue summons to the person in whose possession or power such documents are there and thinks that the same is required to be produced.

The court order discusses the power of a court to issue summons for the production of necessary or desirable documents during an investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings. The court must examine the necessity and desirability of the document and mention the reasons for its decision. The order also explains the relevant provisions of Sections 173 and 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which outline the obligations of the investigating officer and the Magistrate to provide necessary documents to the accused for proper conduct of their defense.

The court order states that it is the duty of the police officer to forward all statements mentioned in sub-section (5)(b) of Section 173 of Cr.P.C to the Magistrate without exception. If the police officer withholds any statement or part thereof, they must provide reasons for doing so. The Magistrate has the discretion to allow or deny such requests. The accused has the right to access all evidence collected by the investigating officer during the investigation. The purpose of the relevant provisions incorporated under Section 173(5) and 173(6) and Section 207 of the Code is to ensure fair and just investigation and trial. The accused has the right to access evidence that is in their favor but which the prosecution is unwilling to produce in court and whose disclosure does not harm public interest.

The court order emphasizes that the investigating agency and prosecution must be fair, just, and reasonable in their actions towards the accused. Withholding evidence in favor of the accused is a violation of the Constitution of India. The court has the duty to discover the truth of the case and must not leave any stone unturned. If the accused is denied access to evidence in their favor, it weakens the faith of the people in the judiciary.

The court allows the accused-petitioner to inspect the whole record, including statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code, and to supply the same if there is relevancy and admissibility on moving such application by him. The right of inspection will not affect the validity of any part of the trial, including the examination of the accused.

In conclusion, the court order discussed in this article highlights the importance of fair and just investigation and trial. The accused has the right to access all evidence collected by the investigating officer during the investigation, and withholding evidence in favor of the accused is a violation of the Constitution of India. The court has the duty to discover the truth of the case and must not leave any stone unturned. The accused-petitioner is allowed to inspect the whole record, including statements recorded under Section 161 of the Code, and to supply the same if there is relevancy and admissibility on moving such application by him.
