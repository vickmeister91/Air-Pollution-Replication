The Supreme Court of India recently issued two court orders related to the protection and preservation of the Victoria Memorial Hall, a historic monument located in Kolkata, West Bengal, and the surrounding environment. The first order pertains to a bus terminus located near the monument, while the second order pertains to a bus terminus located in the Esplanade area of Agra.

In the first case, the State of West Bengal appealed against an order by the Calcutta High Court to shift a bus terminus located near the Victoria Memorial Hall to a distant place within six months. The High Court had made this order to protect and preserve the historic monument and its green surroundings. The State argued that the bus terminus had been in existence for over six decades and shifting it would cause immense inconvenience to the traveling public.

The Supreme Court found that while the bus terminus was located 2 kms away from the Victoria Memorial Hall, the auto-exhaust from a large number of buses at the terminus would pollute the atmospheric environment around the monument. The Court upheld the recommendation of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) that the bus terminus should be shifted from the existing location as a long-term measure to protect and preserve the Victoria Memorial.

However, the Court found that the High Court was not justified in directing the immediate shifting of the bus terminus within six months and set aside this direction. The Court directed the State to take appropriate measures to shift the bus terminus to a suitable location as recommended by NEERI, but did not specify a timeline for this action.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a recommendation by NEERI to shift a bus terminus from the Esplanade area in Agra to protect and preserve the Victoria Memorial Hall. The Court directed the state government to consider and take appropriate action on the NEERI report recommending relocation of the bus terminus away from the Esplanade.

The Court also dismissed Special Leave Petitions with no order as to costs. This means that the Court did not find any merit in the petitions and did not impose any costs on the parties involved.

These court orders highlight the importance of protecting and preserving historic monuments and their surrounding environments. The Supreme Court has recognized the need to balance the interests of the traveling public with the need to protect and preserve these monuments. The Court has also recognized the importance of expert recommendations in making decisions related to the protection and preservation of the environment.

It is now up to the State governments to take appropriate action to implement the recommendations of NEERI and ensure the long-term protection and preservation of these historic monuments. This may involve the relocation of bus terminuses or other measures to reduce pollution and protect the environment.
