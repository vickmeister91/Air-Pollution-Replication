The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Klen and Marshalls, seeking to quash an order issued by the police directing the Deputy Manager-Credits of I.C.I.C.I. Banking Corporation to produce certain documents for investigation into a complaint alleging forgery of signatures by the directors of the company. The petitioner contends that the order is without jurisdiction and that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.) have no application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir where the cause has arisen.

The court, however, dismisses the writ petition on the grounds that the cause of action has not arisen within the jurisdiction of the court, and that the petition was not filed by a competent person. The court also holds that the challenge made on technical points will not be helpful to the petitioner, and that the investigating agency should be allowed to conduct a free and fair investigation into the matter.
