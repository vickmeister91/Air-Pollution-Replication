The Bombay High Court recently heard a criminal application brought by Pratap Lal Teli against the State of Maharashtra and others. Teli sought to quash an order passed by the Sessions Court and to direct the Worli Police Station to register a First Information Report (FIR) and investigate the case in accordance with Chapter XII of the Criminal Procedure Code. Teli alleged that several accused persons had commenced construction of a commercial and IT building without adhering to the norms contained in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court considered whether the offence contained under Section 15 of the Act was cognizable or non-cognizable and whether the learned Sessions Judge had erred in rejecting the relief sought by Teli. The court reserved its judgment on 25th September 2019 and pronounced it on 22nd October 2019.

The court order discusses a revision application related to the construction of a building in Mumbai. The applicant had filed a complaint under Section 156(3) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, alleging violations of the Act. The court examines the issue of whether the complaint can be entertained at the pre-cognizance stage and directs the police to register an FIR. The court notes that the Act is a special enactment for environmental protection and empowers the Central Government to take measures to protect and improve the quality of the environment. The court reproduces Section 15 of the Act, which prescribes penalties for contravention of its provisions, and Section 19, which provides for cognizance of offences. The court also refers to various judgments in support of its findings.

The court order discusses the restrictions on taking cognizance of offences under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the procedure for initiating proceedings. The court compares Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure with Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act and concludes that the special provision contained in the latter continues to govern the field. The court also cites the principle of criminal jurisprudence that anyone can set the criminal law into motion except where the statute indicates to the contrary.

The court order discusses the principle that anyone can set the criminal law in motion by filing a complaint of facts of an offense constituting an offense before a Magistrate entitled to take cognizance under Section 190. However, certain statutes contain restrictions and qualifications for filing a complaint, and in such cases, Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have to make way for the special provision containing special stipulation in the statute. The court also cites various statutory provisions that support this legal position. The order also discusses the importance of special statutes specifying the eligibility of a complainant and how such eligibility criteria prescribed by a statute would constrict the operation of Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order discusses the requirement of previous sanction for prosecution under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966. The court cites previous cases to support the position that the police cannot register an FIR for an offense punishable under the Act without the previous sanction of the specified authority. The court also refers to Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, which imposes a restriction on the court taking cognizance of an offense except on a complaint prescribed in sub-sections (a) and (b) of Section 19. The court concludes that the order passed by the learned Magistrate does not suffer from any legal infirmity.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 43 of the Act and the procedure for prosecuting offenses under it. The learned Single Judge concluded that in the absence of any provision in the Act relating to institution, investigation, inquiry or trial, the Code of Criminal Procedure would apply and, therefore, the FIR was a permissible mode. However, the court disagrees with this reasoning and states that the provisions contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure get displaced by the provisions of the special enactment, which includes the manner in which the cognizance of offenses to be taken is contemplated. The court ultimately dismisses the Criminal Application with no order as to costs.

In summary, the Bombay High Court heard a criminal application brought by Pratap Lal Teli against the State of Maharashtra and others regarding the construction of a commercial and IT building without adhering to the norms contained in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court examined the issue of whether the offence contained under Section 15 of the Act was cognizable or non-cognizable and whether the learned Sessions Judge had erred in rejecting the relief sought by Teli. The court also discussed the restrictions on taking cognizance of offences under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the procedure for initiating proceedings. The court ultimately dismissed the Criminal Application with no order as to costs.
