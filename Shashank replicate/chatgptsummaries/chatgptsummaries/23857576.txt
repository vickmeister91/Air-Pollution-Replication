The case in question involves a petition filed by Lajjaram under Section 482Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside an order passed by the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, which had refused to release his tractor and trolley. The vehicle had been seized as case property in FIR No.116/2017, registered at Police Station Mandrayal District Karauli, for an offense under Section 379 IPC and under Sections 29, 50, 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the alleged offense and that their continued detention was causing him undue hardship. The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions imposed by the court included a requirement that the petitioner keep the vehicle intact and produce it when required by the trial court. Additionally, the petitioner was required to execute a Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court.

The decision to release the tractor and trolley was based on the fact that they were not directly involved in the alleged offense and that their continued detention was causing undue hardship to the petitioner. The court recognized that the seizure of property as case property is a necessary step in the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses, but also noted that such seizures must be balanced against the rights of the property owner.

In this case, the court found that the continued detention of the tractor and trolley was not necessary for the investigation or prosecution of the alleged offense and that their release would not prejudice the case in any way. The conditions imposed by the court were intended to ensure that the petitioner would comply with any future orders of the trial court and that the vehicle would be available for any further investigation or prosecution.

Overall, the court's decision in this case reflects a careful balancing of the interests of the state in investigating and prosecuting criminal offenses with the rights of property owners to be free from undue hardship and deprivation of their property. The court recognized that seizures of property as case property are an important tool in the fight against crime, but also emphasized the need to ensure that such seizures are proportionate and do not unduly burden innocent parties.
