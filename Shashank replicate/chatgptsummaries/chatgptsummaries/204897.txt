In the first court order, Ghatge Patil Transport Limited challenged the constitutional validity of Sections 52 and 52(1-A) of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, as applicable to the State of Maharashtra. The company argued that the provisions were violative of Article 19(1)(g) and Article 300A of the Constitution of India. The court examined the definition of "forest produce" and found that it included any product manufactured out of a forest produce with the aid of human skill. The court also found that the provisions of Section 52 and 52(1-A) of the said Act were not unreasonable and were in keeping with the object and purpose behind the enactment of the said Act.

The second court order discussed the constitutional validity of provisions in the Forest (Conservation) Act related to the seizure, confiscation, and forfeiture of forest produce and the tools and vehicles used in transporting them. The court found that the provisions were not unreasonable and were necessary to regulate the movement of forest produce and prevent destruction of forests. The court also noted that there are elaborate procedures in place to safeguard the rights of citizens in relation to forest produce and that the provisions do not violate Article 19(1)(g) or Article 300A of the Constitution. The court also addressed the issue of non-compliance with Section 58H of the Wild Life Act, which relates to the notice of forfeiture of property.

In the third court order, the provisions of Section 58A and 58H of the Wild Life Act were discussed, and their applicability in the case at hand was examined. The petitioners argued that they were not aware of the contents of the parcel they were transporting and that Mappia Foetida is a medicinal plant and not covered by the Wild Life Act. However, the court rejected these arguments and noted that the decision in Janu Chandra Waghmare's case and Sujit Kumar Rana's case were not applicable to the present case. The court dismissed the petition and ruled in favor of the competent authority.

Overall, these court orders deal with the constitutional validity of various provisions related to forest produce and wildlife protection. The courts have examined the definitions of forest produce and the purpose behind the enactment of these laws. They have also considered the rights of citizens and the need to regulate the movement of forest produce to prevent destruction of forests. In each case, the courts have ruled in favor of the provisions and dismissed the petitions.
