The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to land transfers and ownership in the state of Meghalaya, India. The first court order pertains to a writ appeal filed by Seven City Developers Pvt Ltd against the State of Meghalaya and others. The appellant had submitted an application seeking prior sanction for the transfer of land from a tribal to the company, which was owned by non-tribals. The competent authority failed to take a decision within the stipulated time, and the appellant claimed to have acquired deemed sanction. The court dismissed the writ petition, but directed the authority to consider the application for condonation of delay in filing the appeal. The order also provides details of the appellant's correspondence with the authorities and the cancellation of the land document granted to the tribals.

The second court order, VII/Gen/91/2011-12 from the Deputy Secretary to the Executive Committee, Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council, Shillong, directed the checking of sale deeds given to non-Khasis and the possibility of taking back land wrongly given against administration and customs. The petitioners argued that there was no transfer of land and no violation of any law or custom. However, the land documents were cancelled, and the petitioners were deprived of their property rights without being heard, which goes against natural justice. The court set aside the communication dated 07.03.2012 and ordered the respondents to inquire into the matter as per law after giving the petitioners an opportunity to explain/establish their claim. The appellant filed a writ petition, which was dismissed by the learned single judge of the court. The court found that the land belonged to tribal natives of the State of Meghalaya, and there were no terms and conditions in the articles of agreement that allowed either party to transfer the land in question.

The third court order requires the second party to provide assistance to the residents of certain villages in Meghalaya, India, in improving their income and quality of life through various employment schemes and livelihood programs. The second party is also required to provide education and knowledge about agriculture and other income-generating methods, and to buy back produce from the first party. The order also covers health and sanitation, educational empowerment, infrastructure and communication development, and cultural and sports activities. The agreement between the parties is not registered, and there are customary restrictions on the alienation of the land.

The fourth court order discusses the transfer of land in Meghalaya and the appointment of a competent authority by the government to approve such transfers. Section 3 of the Act of 1971 prohibits the transfer of land from a tribal to a non-tribal or from a non-tribal to another non-tribal without the previous sanction of the competent authority. The court also refers to a report by the Divisional Forest Officer, which states that 60% of the land in question has forest coverage and would require prior approval from the Central Government for non-forestry activities.

The fifth court order states that a portion of land in Meghalaya has evidence of felling of large trees and clearing of bamboo for growing turmeric. However, since 60% of the land area is forest land, any transfer of the land for non-forest activities would require prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Meghalaya Forest Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2012 also requires approval of Forest and Environment Department to ensure no contravention of Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court dismisses the writ appeal as non-forest activities by a non-tribal in the forest area of Meghalaya are not permitted under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and Meghalaya Forest Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2012. The court also notes the denudation of forest coverage in Meghalaya and dismisses any attempt to start non-forest activities in forest land belonging to local tribes.

In summary, these court orders highlight the complexities and challenges of land ownership and transfer in Meghalaya, India. The court orders emphasize the importance of following legal procedures and obtaining proper approvals before transferring land, especially in cases where the land has forest coverage or is owned by tribal natives. The court also stresses the need to protect the rights of all parties involved and to ensure that natural justice is upheld. The court orders also highlight the importance of providing assistance and support to local communities to improve their livelihoods and quality of life.
