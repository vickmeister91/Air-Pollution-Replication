In the first case, the petitioner sought to quash the allotment of work of advertisements worth Rs. 18 crores to respondent No. 5 for 11 years on the grounds of lack of transparency and creating a monopoly in the field of publicity. The petitioner argued that the contract prohibits private building owners from displaying advertisements on their own buildings on payment of advertisement tax and while complying with all other regulatory legal requirements. The court found that the clause creating a monopoly violates the fundamental right to advertise and is not permissible in law. The court also noted that the right to advertise is a part of the fundamental right of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India.

The court concluded that the issue raised ought to be gone into on merits, particularly when petitioners have undertaken to abandon the remedy of suit and injunction was declined, inter-alia, on account of pendency of a connected petition. This means that the court will further investigate the matter and make a decision based on the merits of the case. The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the fundamental right to advertise and prevents the creation of monopolies in the field of publicity.

In the second case, the court order stated that Section 326J is not arbitrary and must be observed with natural justice and supported by reasons. Any action taken under this section can be appealed to the State Government under Section 326H. The court also ruled that a clause in an agreement transferring the monopoly of advertisement to a private party on a principal-to-principal basis is against the law and cannot be sustained. However, the petitioner's right is subject to regulatory provisions under Sections 122 and 123 of the Act.

The case is to be referred to the Reporter, which means that the court will further investigate the matter and make a decision based on the merits of the case. The court's decision in this case is significant as it upholds the importance of natural justice and the right to appeal any action taken under Section 326J. It also prevents the creation of monopolies in the field of advertisement and ensures that the petitioner's right is subject to regulatory provisions under Sections 122 and 123 of the Act.

Overall, both court orders uphold the fundamental right to advertise and prevent the creation of monopolies in the field of publicity. They also emphasize the importance of natural justice and the right to appeal any action taken under Section 326J. The cases will be further investigated and decided based on their merits.
