The issue of unauthorized industrial activity in residential areas of Delhi has been a matter of concern for the court for some time. Despite previous orders, the government has failed to relocate industries and stop new ones from being set up in residential areas. The court has ordered the government to take action against industries operating in non-conforming areas in violation of the Master Plan and Zonal Plan. The court has also noted the Ministry of Urban Development's opposition to regularization and the environmental impact of industrial waste on the Yamuna river.

The court notes that 50 million gallons per day of industrial waste is going into the Yamuna river, and that if the present attitudes and practices persist, Delhi would become an ugly, unhealthy, unworkable, and unlivable city. The court also criticizes the government's proposal for INSITU regularization in areas with 70% concentration of industries, stating that it has not considered the relevant infrastructure and the rights of the residents. The court further notes that the government has been shifting its stand on the issue and has failed to perform its functions and obligations under the Delhi Development Act.

The National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985 was enacted to provide for the development of the National Capital Region and to avoid haphazard development. The court notes that there are plots available in the National Capital Region for industries to shift to, but lack of action and initiative by the authorities is the main reason for the industry continuing illegal activity. The court also dismisses the argument that the industries were working with the consent of the government and emphasizes that an illegality cannot become a legality on inaction or connivance of the government authorities.

The court cites various legal principles and cases to support the argument that the authorities have a duty to ensure compliance with the law and protect the right to life and a healthy environment. The court also questions the proposal for INSITU regularization, which would allow for the continued use of such premises for industrial activity, and notes opposition from various parties.

The court has opposed the proposal of INSITU regularization and has stated that such industries should be immediately closed down/shifted. The court has also noted that the regularization of such industries would result in further congestion and pollution in the already highly congested city. The court has directed that all industrial units, except household industries, which have come up in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi after 1st August 1990, have to stop functioning. The court has criticized the governmental authorities for not taking action against the blatant breach of legal provisions.

The court order states that all industrial units in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi that were established after August 1, 1990, must close down and stop operating within a specific time schedule. The order also directs the Central Government to finalize the list of permissible household industries falling in category 'A' within three months and allot industrial plots to 6,000 industrial units on the waiting list within one year. The order appoints a Monitoring Committee responsible for stopping illegal industrial activity and requires progress reports to be filed regularly.

In conclusion, the court has taken a strong stance against unauthorized industrial activity in residential areas of Delhi. The court has ordered the government to take action against industries operating in non-conforming areas in violation of the Master Plan and Zonal Plan. The court has also opposed the proposal of INSITU regularization and has stated that such industries should be immediately closed down/shifted. The court has directed that all industrial units, except household industries, which have come up in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi after 1st August 1990, have to stop functioning.
