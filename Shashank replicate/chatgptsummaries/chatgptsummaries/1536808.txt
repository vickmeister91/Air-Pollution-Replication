The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to two writ petitions filed in public interest regarding air pollution caused by the plying of a large number of motor vehicles using unauthorized kerosene oil and diesel in the city of Gwalior. The court examined the record and found that the policy of pollution control adopted by the government of Madhya Pradesh is inadequate. As a result, the court issued several directions to the state government to address the issue of air pollution in the city.

One of the key directions issued by the court was for the state government to provide necessary equipment for checking emissions. This is a crucial step in ensuring that vehicles on the road are not emitting harmful pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The court also directed the state government to issue instructions to authorities in charge of vehicle registration to comply with legislative mandates. This is important because it ensures that only vehicles that meet the required emission standards are allowed on the road.

Another important direction issued by the court was for the state government to identify roads to be declared one way for public vehicles to reduce traffic load. This is a common strategy used in cities around the world to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. By designating certain roads as one way, the flow of traffic can be better managed, reducing the number of vehicles on the road and, in turn, reducing air pollution.

The court ordered compliance with these directions within three months, which is a relatively short timeframe. This shows the urgency with which the court views the issue of air pollution in the city of Gwalior. The court also disposed of the writ petitions, indicating that it considers the matter to be resolved as long as the state government complies with the directions issued.

Overall, this court order is an important step in addressing the issue of air pollution in the city of Gwalior. By issuing specific directions to the state government, the court is taking a proactive approach to addressing the issue and ensuring that action is taken to improve air quality in the city. It remains to be seen how effective these directions will be in practice, but the court's order is a positive development in the ongoing fight against air pollution in India.
