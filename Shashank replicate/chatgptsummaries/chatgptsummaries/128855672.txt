The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity heard an appeal by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd against the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's order in a case regarding Reliance Infrastructure's generation business. The Commission assessed the annual revenue requirement and fixed the tariff under sections 61 and 62 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Reliance Infrastructure was aggrieved on several counts, including the Commission's treatment of efficiency gains and interest on working capital. The Commission disallowed expenses under the sub-head of "Contributions and Donations" under A&G expenses for the FY 2007.

The court order discusses various issues related to the tariff determination for a power generating company. The appellant has challenged the Commission's decision on various grounds, including the sharing of efficiency gains, treatment of interest on internal sources, and disallowance of certain expenses. The court has examined each of these issues and provided its decision with reasons. It has found merit in the appeal regarding the sharing of efficiency gains and has directed the Commission to reconsider its decision. The court has also directed the Commission to reconsider its decision on the treatment of interest on internal sources and the disallowance of certain expenses.

The court order discusses the revised interest on working capital estimated for a company called REL-G, which was higher than what was approved by the Commission. The reason for the deviation was due to some elements of working capital that were not considered by the Commission. The Commission estimated the normative working capital interest based on approved expenses, but since REL-G had not actually incurred any expenditure towards interest on working capital during FY 2006-07, the entire normative interest on working capital was treated as efficiency gains. The court also discusses expenses incurred by REL-G towards community development, social welfare, and environmental activities, which were disallowed by the Commission for recoverable from consumers. The appellant argues that such expenses were allowed in earlier years and should be allowed for the year in question as well.

The court order pertains to an appeal by a power company regarding certain expenses that were disallowed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) in their tariff order. The expenses in question were related to efficiency gains, interest on internal sources, contributions and donations, and income tax liabilities on incentives. The court allowed the appeal in part and directed the MERC to allow the claim of the appellant towards efficiency gain, interest on working capital, income tax payable on the PLF incentive, and expenses incurred to meet statutory obligations. The court rejected the appellant's claims towards employees' expenses and R&M on fuel de-sulphurization plant as they were not pressed.
