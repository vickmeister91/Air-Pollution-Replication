The court order in question pertains to a reference application filed under Section 35G(3) of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The question of law raised was whether electric cables used by the assessee for its foundry were capital goods as defined under Rule 57-Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The court held that the question was no longer relevant as it had already been answered by the Supreme Court in a previous case.

The court stated that electric cables used by the assessee were certainly meant for carrying on its business and were sufficiently durable, and therefore, were considered a 'plant' within the meaning of Rule 57-Q of the Rules. The reference application was rejected.

The case in question involved a dispute over whether electric cables used by the assessee for its foundry were capital goods as defined under Rule 57-Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The assessee had filed a reference application under Section 35G(3) of the Central Excise Act, 1944, seeking clarification on this issue.

The court noted that the question of law raised in the reference application had already been answered by the Supreme Court in a previous case. The court held that the electric cables used by the assessee were certainly meant for carrying on its business and were sufficiently durable, and therefore, were considered a 'plant' within the meaning of Rule 57-Q of the Rules.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the electric cables were an essential part of the assessee's foundry and were used for carrying out its manufacturing process. The court noted that the electric cables were not only used for carrying electricity but also for carrying molten metal, which was an integral part of the manufacturing process.

The court also noted that the electric cables were sufficiently durable and were expected to last for a considerable period of time. The court held that the electric cables were therefore a 'plant' within the meaning of Rule 57-Q of the Rules.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the definition of 'plant' under Rule 57-Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The court's decision also highlights the importance of electric cables in the manufacturing process and their status as a capital good.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case clarifies the definition of 'plant' under Rule 57-Q of the Central Excise Rules, 1944. The court held that electric cables used by the assessee for its foundry were certainly meant for carrying on its business and were sufficiently durable, and therefore, were considered a 'plant' within the meaning of Rule 57-Q of the Rules.
