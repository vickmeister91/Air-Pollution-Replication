The Patna High Court recently dismissed a civil writ petition filed by Shambhu Sharan Singh, director of Vivekanand Mission School, against the State of Bihar, the Agriculture Department, the Collector of Aurangabad, and others. Singh had challenged the consent granted by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board to Laxman Prasad for operating a cold storage unit. The court held that Singh had an alternative statutory remedy available under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and therefore, it was not appropriate to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court directed that if Singh files an appeal within four weeks, the Member, Board of Revenue, shall proceed to consider it without raising the issue of delay. This decision by the Patna High Court highlights the importance of understanding the legal remedies available to individuals and entities when challenging government decisions.

Singh's petition was based on the argument that the cold storage unit operated by Laxman Prasad would cause pollution and adversely affect the health of the students at Vivekanand Mission School. Singh had also argued that the consent granted by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board was illegal and arbitrary.

However, the court held that Singh had an alternative statutory remedy available under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This section provides for the filing of an appeal before the Appellate Authority against any order made by the State Pollution Control Board. The court noted that Singh had not exhausted this remedy before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court also observed that the remedy under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was an effective and efficacious remedy, and therefore, it was not appropriate to exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court cited several previous decisions of the Supreme Court of India, which had held that the availability of an alternative remedy was a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court's decision is significant because it emphasizes the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. This principle is based on the doctrine of exhaustion of remedies, which requires individuals and entities to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court for relief.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, in regulating pollution in India. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and establishes the State Pollution Control Boards to implement its provisions. The Act also provides for the filing of appeals against any order made by the State Pollution Control Board, thereby ensuring that individuals and entities have an effective remedy against pollution.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's decision in Shambhu Sharan Singh v. State of Bihar emphasizes the importance of understanding the legal remedies available to individuals and entities when challenging government decisions. The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The decision also underscores the importance of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, in regulating pollution in India and providing an effective remedy against pollution.
