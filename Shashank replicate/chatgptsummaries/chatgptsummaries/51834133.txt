The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between the Kerala State Coastal Management Authority and DLF Universal Limited regarding a housing project on the eastern bank of Chilavannurkayal. The developer claimed to have obtained all necessary permissions, while the coastal management authority and environment authority disputed this. The project was approved by the Central Expert Appraisal Committee as a "Silver Grading" project, but the CRZ Committee of the Ministry required a separate clearance under the Coastal Regulation Zone. DLF began construction without waiting for environmental clearance, and the KCZMA issued a letter seeking explanation. The KCZMA later recommended the project proposal to the MoEF, and a sub-committee appointed by KCZMA made certain recommendations. The project was nearing completion by the time of these developments.

The court found that there were violations of environmental regulations, including land reclamation and lack of prior approval. The court ordered a fine of Rs. 1 crore to be paid by DLF and deposited in a separate account for environmental purposes. The court also dismissed writ petitions filed by prospective buyers of the apartments and upheld the findings of the learned single judge. The KCZMA/appellant, an environmental authority, appealed the decision, arguing that the building should be demolished or the fine substantially increased. The Cochin Municipal Corporation raised concerns about the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 1.99 granted to the project, which exceeded the maximum FAR of 1.5 allowed by the Kerala Building Rules.

The court order largely focuses on the issue of FAR sanction and the contradictory stands taken by different authorities, including the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental regulations and the need for strict compliance. The case involves a building permit issued in 2007, when the maximum FAR for central city of Kochi was reduced to 2, and the FAR of 1.99 was made available. The court also notes the obligation of regulatory authorities to facilitate informed decisions and compliance by entrepreneurs. The court concludes that authorities have not performed their task with promptitude and emphasizes the importance of compliances.

The court order discusses a case involving alleged violations by DLF in the construction of a resort in a CRZ area. The court finds fault with the authorities for their lackadaisical attitude and contradictions in their approach. The court sets aside the findings of the impugned order while sustaining the fine of Rs.1 crore and directs strict adherence to norms in the future. The court also suggests simplifying the methodology of processing applications for single window clearance to avoid uncertainty and better enforcement. The same should be done within three months from the receipt of the copy of the order.

The court order states that the processing of applications for single window clearance should be simplified to avoid contradictions and ensure better enforcement. The authorities have been given three months to implement this. The appeals in the case have been disposed of and the parties will bear their own costs. The signed reportable judgment has been placed on the file.

In summary, the court order discusses a case involving DLF, a construction company, and their project in a coastal area in India. The court found that there were violations of environmental regulations, including land reclamation and lack of prior approval. The court ordered a fine of Rs. 1 crore to be paid by DLF and deposited in a separate account for environmental purposes. The court also dismissed writ petitions filed by prospective buyers of the apartments and upheld the findings of the learned single judge.
