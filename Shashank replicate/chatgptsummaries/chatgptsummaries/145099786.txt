The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India and others regarding the sealing issue. The court heard various applications seeking directions and exemptions from filing O.T. by different parties. The court ordered that the SDMC file a report before the Monitoring Committee by 18.04.2019 regarding a structure that has been in existence since 2012-13. The Monitoring Committee is to take a decision within seven days and the matter is listed for the next hearing on 26.04.2019.

The sealing issue in Delhi has been a contentious one for several years now. The issue pertains to the sealing of illegal commercial establishments in residential areas of the city. The Supreme Court had ordered the sealing of such establishments in 2006, but the issue has remained unresolved since then. The sealing drive has been opposed by traders and businessmen, who argue that it has adversely affected their livelihoods.

In this context, the recent court order is significant as it pertains to a specific structure that has been in existence since 2012-13. The court has ordered the SDMC to file a report before the Monitoring Committee regarding this structure by 18.04.2019. The Monitoring Committee is a body appointed by the Supreme Court to oversee the sealing drive in Delhi. The Committee comprises of three members, including a former bureaucrat, a retired judge, and a senior advocate.

The court has directed the Monitoring Committee to take a decision on the matter within seven days of receiving the report from the SDMC. This indicates that the court is keen on resolving the issue in a timely manner. The matter has been listed for the next hearing on 26.04.2019, which suggests that the court is closely monitoring the progress of the case.

It is important to note that the court has heard various applications seeking directions and exemptions from filing O.T. by different parties. O.T. refers to an undertaking that is filed by parties before the court. The undertaking is a promise to abide by the court's orders and directions. The court's decision to hear these applications indicates that it is taking a comprehensive approach to the sealing issue.

The sealing issue has been a major source of controversy in Delhi for several years now. The issue has been politicized by various parties, including the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The AAP has been critical of the sealing drive, arguing that it has adversely affected small traders and businessmen. The BJP, on the other hand, has accused the AAP of not doing enough to resolve the issue.

In this context, the court's recent order is significant as it indicates that the judiciary is taking a proactive approach to resolving the issue. The court's decision to direct the SDMC to file a report before the Monitoring Committee and to set a deadline for the Committee to take a decision on the matter suggests that the court is keen on resolving the issue in a timely manner.

Overall, the court's recent order pertaining to the sealing issue in Delhi is significant as it indicates that the judiciary is taking a proactive approach to resolving the issue. The court's decision to direct the SDMC to file a report before the Monitoring Committee and to set a deadline for the Committee to take a decision on the matter suggests that the court is keen on resolving the issue in a timely manner.
