In the first court order, the petitioner, M. Balachandra Menon, sought a writ of mandamus to direct the first respondent to issue a certificate of ownership of the tusks of two elephants that he owned, which had died in 2009 and 2010. The petitioner contended that declarations under Section 40 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 had been submitted, and orders were liable to be passed under Section 42 of the Act, after hearing the petitioner.

The court considered the petitioner's arguments and ordered that if the petitioner is in possession of the tusks and if he prefers declarations as required in Section 40 within two weeks from the date of receipt of the judgment, the competent among the respondents shall make due enquiries under Section 41 and take a decision in terms of Section 42 within a period of one month thereafter. This means that the competent authorities will investigate the matter and make a decision on the ownership of the tusks within a month of receiving the petitioner's declarations.

In the second court order, it is stated that the court order is dated 7.4.2010 and was submitted by the petitioner before the 1st respondent. A true copy was given to the PS to Judge. This order seems to be a record of the submission of the court order by the petitioner to the first respondent, with a copy given to the PS to Judge for record-keeping purposes.

Overall, these court orders relate to a dispute over the ownership of tusks from two elephants that had died in 2009 and 2010. The petitioner is seeking a certificate of ownership and has submitted declarations under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has ordered that the competent authorities investigate the matter and make a decision within a month of receiving the petitioner's declarations. The second court order is simply a record of the submission of the first court order.
