The case in question involves a Criminal Misc. Petition filed by the accused-petitioner against an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate No.17, Jaipur Metropolitan, Jaipur in Criminal Case No.66/2010. The petitioner requested that documents Ex.P1 to P9 filed by the respondent-complainant on 3.8.2009 be taken off the record. The trial court dismissed the application, and the accused-petitioner subsequently filed a petition to set aside the same. The court dismissed the petition, stating that additional evidence, oral or documentary, can be produced during the course of trial if in the opinion of the Court production of it is essential for the proper disposal of the case.

The accused-petitioner's argument was that the documents in question were not relevant to the case and were being used to prejudice the court against him. However, the trial court found that the documents were relevant and admissible, and therefore refused to remove them from the record.

The accused-petitioner then filed a petition to set aside the trial court's decision, arguing that the court had erred in its interpretation of the law. Specifically, the accused-petitioner argued that the trial court had failed to consider the provisions of Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice.

The High Court, however, found no merit in the accused-petitioner's argument. The court noted that the trial court had considered the relevance and admissibility of the documents in question, and had found them to be both relevant and admissible. The High Court further noted that the accused-petitioner had not provided any evidence to suggest that the trial court had acted improperly or had failed to consider relevant factors in making its decision.

The High Court also rejected the accused-petitioner's argument that the trial court had erred in its interpretation of Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court noted that the section provides for the exercise of inherent powers by the High Court, but only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of any court or where the ends of justice require intervention. In this case, the High Court found that there was no such abuse of process or need for intervention, and therefore declined to exercise its inherent powers.

In conclusion, the High Court upheld the trial court's decision to refuse the accused-petitioner's request to remove documents Ex.P1 to P9 from the record. The court found that the documents were relevant and admissible, and that the trial court had not erred in its interpretation of the law. The accused-petitioner's petition was therefore dismissed.
