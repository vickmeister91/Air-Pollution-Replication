The Patna High Court recently issued a ruling in a case involving two individuals who were accused of transporting illegally mined sand. The court denied anticipatory bail to one of the petitioners, who was driving the tractor that was carrying the sand. However, the court granted bail to the other petitioner, who was the owner of the tractor.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that the owner of the tractor had any knowledge of the illegal activity that was taking place. As a result, the court determined that it would be unfair to deny him bail.

The bail that was granted to the owner of the tractor was conditional. He was required to present himself before the police or the court whenever he was required to do so. Additionally, his bail bonds would be cancelled if he failed to appear on two consecutive occasions.

This ruling highlights the importance of ensuring that individuals are not unfairly punished for crimes that they did not commit. In this case, the court recognized that the owner of the tractor was not aware of the illegal activity that was taking place and therefore should not be held responsible for it.

At the same time, the court also recognized the seriousness of the crime that was committed. Transporting illegally mined sand is a serious offense that can have significant environmental and social consequences. As a result, the court denied anticipatory bail to the driver of the tractor, who was directly involved in the illegal activity.

Overall, this ruling demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the evidence in criminal cases and ensuring that individuals are not unfairly punished. By granting bail to the owner of the tractor, the court was able to ensure that justice was served while also protecting the rights of an innocent individual.
