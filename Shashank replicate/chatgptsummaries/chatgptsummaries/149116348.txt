The court order pertains to a second appeal filed by the legal representatives of defendants 3 to 5 in a suit filed for declaration, partition, and injunction. The suit property in question was purchased by the second wife of Oor Ranga Naikkar, and the case revolves around whether the property was purchased from joint family income or the first defendant's own income. The courts below rejected the defendants' version and held that the property was the personal property of the first defendant. The court also dismissed the plea of res judicata and lis pendenti. The burden to prove that the first defendant was only a name lender for the joint family was on the plaintiff, which they failed to establish.

The court order states that a plea can only be considered barred by res judicata if it has been heard and determined by a court. Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act restricts the transfer of immovable property by one party during litigation, but does not prevent the vesting of title on a transferee in a sale pending litigation. The court finds no reason to interfere with the judgments of the lower courts in the case and dismisses the second appeal. No costs are ordered.

The case in question revolves around a property purchased by the second wife of Oor Ranga Naikkar. The legal representatives of defendants 3 to 5 filed a second appeal in a suit filed for declaration, partition, and injunction. The defendants claimed that the property was purchased from joint family income, while the courts below held that it was the personal property of the first defendant. The plaintiff failed to establish that the first defendant was only a name lender for the joint family, and the court dismissed the plea of res judicata and lis pendenti.

The court order clarifies that a plea can only be considered barred by res judicata if it has been heard and determined by a court. In this case, the plea was not heard or determined by a court, and therefore cannot be considered barred by res judicata. The court also notes that Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act restricts the transfer of immovable property by one party during litigation, but does not prevent the vesting of title on a transferee in a sale pending litigation.

The court finds no reason to interfere with the judgments of the lower courts in the case and dismisses the second appeal. No costs are ordered. This means that the lower court's decision that the property was the personal property of the first defendant stands, and the defendants' claim that it was purchased from joint family income is rejected.

Overall, the court order provides a clear and concise summary of the case and the court's decision. It highlights the key issues at stake, including the question of whether the property was purchased from joint family income or the first defendant's own income, and the application of res judicata and Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. The court's decision to dismiss the second appeal and uphold the lower court's decision provides clarity and finality to the case.
