The court order pertains to a long-standing dispute between Dirk India Private Limited and Maharashtra State Power Generation Company Limited (Mahgenco) over the handling and disposal of Pulverized Fly Ash (PFA) generated at the Nashik Thermal Power Station (NTPS). Dirk India specializes in recycling by-products generated by thermal power stations to manufacture cement replacement material. The dispute arose over the termination of an agreement between the parties and the specific performance of the agreement. Dirk India had entered into an agreement with Mahgenco to manufacture Pozzocrete from PFA, but disputes arose over the land allotted to Dirk India for installing their ash and processing plant and machinery, the construction and maintenance of the direct approach road, and shifting of high tension wires. Mahgenco terminated the agreement in 2006, and Dirk India filed a petition in court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for interim protection. The court allowed Dirk India to collect the PFA in the same manner before the termination notice was issued and restrained Mahgenco from dispossessing the plant and machinery of Dirk India. An Arbitral Tribunal was constituted, and both sides presented their version before the arbitrators.

The court order discusses the grounds for challenging an arbitration award, including perversity in evidence, lack of dispute or difference, and internal contradictions. The case of ONGC Limited vs. Garware Shipping Corporation Limited is cited as an example of an award being set aside due to perverse conclusions and findings. The order also outlines the narrow compass within which the court must consider challenges to an award. The specific dispute in this case involves the interpretation of clauses in a contract regarding the erection and operation of a PFA handling plant. The petitioner argues that the arbitrators did not decide the real dispute in question and decided something which is not in dispute between the parties. The respondent argues that the petitioner's contentions are contrary to the contract and the award discloses no error of law.

The court emphasized that the scope of scrutiny under Section 34 of the Act is narrow and that the petitioner must bring its case within the available grounds to succeed. An arbitrator's award is final and cannot be appealed unless there is an apparent error of law on the face of the award. The court can only set aside an arbitral award if there is proof of incapacity, invalidity of the arbitration agreement, improper notice, or if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by the submission to arbitration. The award can also be set aside if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties or the law. The award can be challenged if it is against the public policy of India or if there is a violation of the Indian Contract Act. The court can consider whether the award is contrary to the terms of the contract, violative of public policy, or if there was no dispute or difference in the claim adjudication.

The court order also discusses the responsibility for the collection and transportation of PFA from ESP to hoppers. Dirk India claims that Mahgenco did not provide the necessary facilities for collecting PFA, leading to a breach of contract. The court order clarifies that the dispute is regarding the responsibility for the collection and transportation of PFA from ESP to hoppers, while the transportation of PFA from hoppers to the PFA plant is Dirk India's responsibility. The court found that the responsibility of transporting PFA was solely on Dirk India, and that Mahgenco was not under any legal obligation to provide a delivery system without hoppers.

The court order discusses various expenses incurred by the claimant for the disposal of non-lifted PFA, including expenses for supervising the ash disposal system, disposing of un-lifted PFA, and water charges for disposal in slurry form. The order also raises questions about interest on monetary damages, specific performance of a contract, and the responsibility for losses caused after termination of the contract. The court notes that the arbitrators narrowed down the issues to four, but this may have resulted in a lack of focus and direction in the proceedings. The court also considers a meeting where the parties discussed their contractual obligations and finds that the arbitrator's finding on this issue may be perverse.

The court order states that parties in arbitration have the right to choose an arbitrator with a technical or judicial background, and their choice reflects how they want the arbitration to be conducted. The depth and quality of reasoning in the award will differ depending on the background of the arbitrator chosen. The court also finds that the award in question is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a complete omission to decide core issues, rendering the arbitration a futile exercise. Additionally, the court notes that both parties involved in the arbitration are dissatisfied with the award.

The court order states that Mahgenco, a statutory body, cannot be deprived of claiming damages even if they complied with the orders of the High Court without challenging them. The Arbitrators were wrong in dismissing the claim of damages without looking into it. The correspondence produced by Mahgenco was official and should have been considered. The court allows the challenge to the award by both parties and sets aside the award under Section 34 of the Act.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a long-standing dispute between Dirk India and Mahgenco over the handling and disposal of PFA generated at the Nashik Thermal Power Station. The court
