The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently received a petition to quash a complaint and summoning order under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint was filed against a construction company and its directors for carrying out illegal construction without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The petitioners argued that they had obtained clearance and a no objection certificate before starting construction. The court heard arguments from both sides and made a decision on the matter.

The case in question pertains to a construction company that was accused of starting a construction project without obtaining the necessary environmental clearance certificate. The company had obtained the certificate later, but the complaint was still filed against them. The court, after hearing both sides, allowed the petition and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings, stating that the continuation of criminal proceedings against the company would be an abuse of process of law.

The court cited the State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal case and listed the categories of cases where the extraordinary power under Article 226 or the inherent powers under Section 482, Cr.P.C. can be exercised by the High Court to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The court also noted that the company had obtained the necessary clearance and no objection certificate before starting construction, which meant that they had not violated any environmental laws.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the company had obtained the necessary clearance and no objection certificate before starting construction. The court also noted that the complaint was filed after the company had obtained the certificate, which meant that the complaint was not valid. The court further stated that the continuation of criminal proceedings against the company would be an abuse of process of law.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary environmental clearance and no objection certificate before starting any construction project. It also emphasizes the need for the courts to prevent the abuse of the process of law and to secure the ends of justice.

In conclusion, the Punjab-Haryana High Court's decision to quash the complaint and all subsequent proceedings against the construction company and its directors is a significant step towards ensuring that environmental laws are followed and that the courts prevent the abuse of the process of law. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to all construction companies to obtain the necessary clearance and no objection certificate before starting any construction project.
