The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Utsav Singh, who sought interim custody of a vehicle that had been seized by the police for carrying sand in excess of the permitted amount. The court granted the petition and ordered that the vehicle be released to the petitioner, subject to certain conditions.

One of the conditions imposed by the court was that the petitioner must produce the original registration and insurance certificates for the vehicle. Additionally, the petitioner was required to furnish a bank guarantee and supurdnama, which is a document that acknowledges the receipt of goods and authorizes their delivery to a specified person.

Furthermore, the court prohibited the petitioner from transferring or using the vehicle for any similar offence. This condition was likely imposed to prevent the petitioner from engaging in any further illegal activities related to the transportation of sand.

Finally, the court ordered that the petitioner must produce the vehicle as and when directed by the trial court. This condition ensures that the vehicle remains available for any further legal proceedings related to the case.

The court also directed that a copy of the order be sent to the trial court for compliance. This step was taken to ensure that the trial court is aware of the conditions imposed by the higher court and can enforce them accordingly.

Overall, the court order in this case demonstrates the importance of following legal procedures and complying with court orders. The conditions imposed by the court serve to protect the interests of all parties involved and ensure that justice is served.
