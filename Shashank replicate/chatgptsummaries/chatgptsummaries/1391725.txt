The case in question revolves around a dispute over Mulanki service lands. The plaintiffs, who are the owners of the land, filed a lawsuit against the defendants seeking an injunction to prevent them from obstructing the plaintiffs' enjoyment of the property. The lower court awarded the plaintiffs' claim, and this decision was upheld on appeal. However, the defendants appealed again, arguing that the suit was barred under Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act and that it was barred by res judicata.

The defendants' first argument was that the suit was barred under Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act. This section states that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which the Collector or any other revenue officer is empowered by law to determine. The defendants argued that the dispute over the Mulanki service lands was a matter that fell within the jurisdiction of the revenue authorities and therefore the civil court had no jurisdiction to hear the case.

The court, however, rejected this argument. The court held that the suit was not barred under Section 4 of the Act because the dispute was not one that fell within the jurisdiction of the revenue authorities. The court noted that the plaintiffs were seeking an injunction to prevent the defendants from obstructing their enjoyment of the property, and this was not a matter that the revenue authorities were empowered to determine. Therefore, the civil court had jurisdiction to hear the case.

The defendants' second argument was that the suit was barred by res judicata. Res judicata is a legal principle that prevents a party from relitigating an issue that has already been decided by a court. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs were litigating under the same title as they held in 1911, and therefore the suit was barred by res judicata.

The court, however, rejected this argument as well. The court held that the plaintiff was not litigating under the same title as he held in 1911. The court noted that the plaintiffs had acquired the land in question through a sale deed executed in their favor in 1920. Therefore, the plaintiffs were litigating under a different title than they held in 1911, and the suit was not barred by res judicata.

In conclusion, the court confirmed the lower court's decision and dismissed the defendants' appeal with costs. The court held that the suit was not barred under Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act and that it was not barred by res judicata. The plaintiffs were entitled to an injunction restraining the defendants from obstructing their enjoyment of the Mulanki service lands. This case serves as an example of the importance of understanding legal principles such as jurisdiction and res judicata when litigating a dispute in court.
