The court order pertains to a case where a member of a backward class approached the court after Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) cancelled the LPG distributorship awarded to him. The petitioner had applied for the distributorship and offered land in Village Kalepur, which was rejected by IOCL. He then offered land in Village Sarwaniya Maharaj, which was accepted by IOCL, and he was declared the winner in the draw. However, IOCL later cancelled the distributorship based on a vigilance report, which claimed that the petitioner was not eligible to participate in the draw. 

The court found that the petitioner was not at fault and had followed IOCL's directions. The court also found that IOCL had not followed the principles of natural justice and fair play while cancelling the distributorship. Therefore, the court ruled in favor of the petitioner and directed IOCL to execute an agreement with the petitioner within 10 days.

The court order also discusses the importance of natural justice in ensuring fair procedures are followed in judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative processes. The two basic principles of natural justice are "nemo judex in causa sua" (no one should be a judge in their own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The court notes that the concept of natural justice has evolved over time and that rules may be implied from the duty to be performed under a statute. 

The court also discusses the "useless formality theory" and the varying opinions on whether relief can be refused even if natural justice is not followed. Overall, natural justice is seen as essential to fair adjudication and the prevention of miscarriage of justice. The court emphasizes that following audi alteram partem (the right to be heard) is not a useless formality, especially when there is a lack of fair play and natural justice. 

The court cites Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and the right to life and liberty, respectively. The court quashes an impugned order and directs the Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. to execute an agreement with the petitioner within 10 days. No costs are awarded.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of natural justice in ensuring fair procedures are followed in judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative processes. The court emphasizes that following audi alteram partem (the right to be heard) is not a useless formality, especially when there is a lack of fair play and natural justice. The court also cites Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee equality before the law and the right to life and liberty, respectively. The court ruled in favor of the petitioner and directed IOCL to execute an agreement with the petitioner within 10 days. No costs were awarded.
