The three court orders discussed in this summary all relate to disputes over land ownership in India. In the first case, Tukaram Maruti Chavan had purchased land from a tenant who had initiated proceedings under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act. However, Chavan did not give notice to the owner of the land, as required under Section 32 F of the Act. The High Court held that Section 32 F is mandatory and the tenant had lost the right to purchase the land due to failure to give notice. Chavan's appeal was dismissed.

In the second case, the tenant did not give notice to the landlord before purchasing the land. The appellant argued that since the landlord did not give notice under Section 31 of the Act, the tenant was not required to give notice under Section 32 F. However, the court found that Section 32 F is independent and separate from Section 31, and the tenant was legally obligated to give notice under Section 32 F. The court cited previous cases to support the mandatory nature of the notice requirement. The court ultimately dismissed the appeal.

The third case also involved a dispute over land ownership and the obligation of tenants to send an intimation under section 32 F (1-A) when the landlord under disability has not sought possession for personal cultivation under section 31 (1). The court concluded that the appellant had a complete knowledge about the title of the disputed land and failed to serve a notice under Section 32F, resulting in the loss of their right to claim the disputed land. The appeal was dismissed.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following the legal requirements for land ownership disputes in India. In each case, failure to comply with specific sections of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act resulted in the loss of rights for the appellant. The courts consistently upheld the mandatory nature of the notice requirements under Section 32 F, emphasizing the importance of notifying all parties involved in land transactions. These cases serve as a reminder to individuals involved in land ownership disputes to carefully follow all legal procedures to avoid losing their rights to the land in question.
