The first court order pertains to a petition filed by Rashpal @ Pala seeking regular bail in a case registered against him under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and nothing had been recovered from him. The state counsel opposed the bail plea, citing delay in receiving the FSL report. The court referred to a previous case and held that the investigating officer's job is complete once he has collected all evidence and facts, and that the report of experts is not necessary for the completion of the investigation. The court did not grant bail to the petitioner.

The second court order discusses the provisions of section 91 and 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allow for the production of documents and additional evidence in court proceedings. The court must balance the interests of the accused in not being incarcerated for an unduly long period with the interest of justice in ensuring that all relevant evidence is considered. The court also notes that the investigation of an offense cannot be considered inconclusive simply because the investigating officer has not yet received reports from experts or has failed to include certain documents in their report to the magistrate. The order cites a recent Supreme Court case to support its reasoning.

The third court order pertains to a case where the petitioners had filed for statutory bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, claiming that the investigating agency had failed to file the final report within 180 days. The learned Special Court had denied the petitioners' claim, which was upheld by the High Court of Kerala. The Hon'ble Supreme Court also found that the charge-sheet filed before the learned Special Court was complete in all respects, and the petitioners were not entitled to statutory bail. The court also clarified that the pendency of a reference to a larger bench does not mean that all other proceedings involving the same issue would remain stayed till a decision was rendered in the reference.

The fourth court order states that the prosecution failed to present a challan due to the absence of reports from the chemical examiner. However, the court notes that the filing of a challan without the report of the forensic science/chemical examiner is not incomplete and that the investigating agency can submit other evidence by way of supplementary challan. The court also notes that the investigating agency has failed to perform its duty by not following the mandatory provisions of law and that there is a shortage of forensic science laboratories in the state. The court orders the petitioners to be released on interim bail until the filing of the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C, on their furnishing adequate bail bonds and surety bonds to the satisfaction of the learned trial Courts. The court also directs that as and when the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or report of chemical examiner is presented to the trial Court, the same shall be taken into consideration, in accordance with law.
