The case in question involves a Criminal Original Petition filed by the petitioner to call for records relating to an order passed by the Court of Principal Special Judge for CBI Cases cum VIII Additional City Civil Judge at Chennai. The petitioner sought to direct the court to issue summons to the General Manager, Board Department, Corporate Office, Indian Bank, Chennai, and Chief Vigilance Officer, Vigilance Department, Corporate Office, Indian Bank, to produce certain documents.

However, the trial court dismissed the petition as the petitioner did not state any specific reason for summoning the documents and filed the petition after 15 years to protract the case. The High Court found no illegality or impropriety in the order passed by the trial court but allowed the petitioner to file a fresh petition showing the purpose for which he requests the court to summon the documents.

The High Court also directed that the cross-examination should go on a day-to-day basis without stopping for any reason. This is an important directive as it ensures that the trial proceeds smoothly and without any unnecessary delays.

The petitioner's failure to state a specific reason for summoning the documents was a major factor in the dismissal of the petition by the trial court. This highlights the importance of providing clear and concise reasons for any legal action taken. It also emphasizes the need for timely action, as the petitioner filed the petition after 15 years, which was seen as an attempt to protract the case.

The High Court's decision to allow the petitioner to file a fresh petition with a clear purpose for summoning the documents is a fair and just decision. It provides the petitioner with an opportunity to present their case in a more organized and effective manner. It also ensures that the trial proceeds in a timely and efficient manner.

The directive to conduct cross-examination on a day-to-day basis is also an important decision. It ensures that the trial proceeds without any unnecessary delays and helps to expedite the process. This is particularly important in criminal cases, where justice delayed is justice denied.

In conclusion, the case highlights the importance of providing clear and concise reasons for any legal action taken. It also emphasizes the need for timely action and the importance of conducting trials in a timely and efficient manner. The High Court's decision to allow the petitioner to file a fresh petition with a clear purpose for summoning the documents and the directive to conduct cross-examination on a day-to-day basis are both fair and just decisions that will help to ensure that justice is served in a timely and efficient manner.
