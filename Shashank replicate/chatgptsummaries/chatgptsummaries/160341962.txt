The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Rajendra Kumar Tamrakar challenging an order passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, General Forest Division-Damoh. The order had prohibited mining operations and directed the petitioner to stop mining operations. The court found that the order was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice as proper opportunity of hearing was not granted to the petitioner. The court quashed the order and remanded the matter back to the competent authority to proceed afresh in accordance with the law.

The petitioner, Rajendra Kumar Tamrakar, had challenged the order passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, General Forest Division-Damoh, which had prohibited mining operations and directed the petitioner to stop mining operations. The petitioner had contended that the order was passed without giving him a proper opportunity of hearing and without following the principles of natural justice.

The court found that the order was indeed passed in violation of the principles of natural justice as proper opportunity of hearing was not granted to the petitioner. The court observed that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to present his case before the competent authority before the order was passed. The court also noted that the order did not specify the reasons for prohibiting mining operations and directing the petitioner to stop mining operations.

The court held that the order was arbitrary and violative of the principles of natural justice. The court quashed the order and remanded the matter back to the competent authority to proceed afresh in accordance with the law. The court directed the competent authority to give the petitioner a proper opportunity of hearing and to pass a reasoned order after considering all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case.

The court did not address the question of dispute pertaining to the jurisdiction of the Divisional Forest Officer. The court only considered the question of violation of principles of natural justice and the arbitrary nature of the order passed by the Divisional Forest Officer.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court has set aside an order passed by the Divisional Forest Officer, General Forest Division-Damoh, which had prohibited mining operations and directed the petitioner to stop mining operations. The court found that the order was passed in violation of the principles of natural justice as proper opportunity of hearing was not granted to the petitioner. The court quashed the order and remanded the matter back to the competent authority to proceed afresh in accordance with the law. The court has directed the competent authority to give the petitioner a proper opportunity of hearing and to pass a reasoned order after considering all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case.
