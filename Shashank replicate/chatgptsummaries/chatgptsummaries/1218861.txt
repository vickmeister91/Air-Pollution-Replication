The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by M/S Shriram Transport Finance against Sanjay Nagesh Savanth under section 482 Cr.F.C. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Additional District and Sessions Judge, Dharwad, which allowed the respondent's application under section 91 Cr.P.C. for the production of relevant books of accounts of Shriram Investments Limited.

The petitioner argued that the order passed by the learned sessions judge was erroneous and that the respondent had no right to seek the production of the books of accounts. The petitioner further contended that the respondent had not made out a case for the production of the books of accounts and that the order passed by the learned sessions judge was therefore illegal and without jurisdiction.

The court, however, refused to entertain the petition, stating that the order made in Company Petitions Nos. 191 and 192/2005 cannot be a ground to reverse the order of the learned sessions judge. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference with the order passed by the learned sessions judge and that the petition was therefore liable to be dismissed.

The court further directed the petitioner to take appropriate steps to cause production of documents before the trial court. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to avoid production of documents merely on the ground that the respondent had not made out a case for the production of the documents.

The court observed that the production of documents was necessary for the proper adjudication of the case and that the petitioner could not be allowed to avoid production of documents merely on the ground that the respondent had not made out a case for the production of the documents.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for quashing the order passed by the learned sessions judge and that the petition was therefore liable to be dismissed.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by M/S Shriram Transport Finance against Sanjay Nagesh Savanth under section 482 Cr.F.C.
