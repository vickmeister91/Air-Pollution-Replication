The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Ramghad Minerals and Mining against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner sought to quash a first information report (FIR) filed against them for alleged illegal mining operations in a forest area. The court considered various issues, including the power of the investigating officer to register the FIR, the power of the respondent to seize machinery and equipment, and the legality of mining operations in forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government.

The court held that the FIR could not be quashed at this stage, and that no non-forest activity could be carried out in forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government. The court also stated that the petitioner's request for relief was rejected, and the impugned order of the Deputy Conservator of Forests was quashed. The Deputy Conservator of Forests was directed to inspect and survey the impugned area and report any violations. The petitioner was given two weeks to rectify any violations found.

If the petitioner had encroached, the lease granting authority was at liberty to order for stopping of mining activity and cancel the lease. Any seized machinery or vehicles must be released subject to the petitioner's undertaking. The writ petition was disposed of.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the power of the investigating officer to register the FIR. The petitioner had argued that the investigating officer did not have the power to register the FIR, as the alleged offence was not cognizable. However, the court held that the investigating officer had the power to register the FIR, as the alleged offence was cognizable.

Secondly, the court considered the power of the respondent to seize machinery and equipment. The petitioner had argued that the respondent did not have the power to seize machinery and equipment, as the alleged offence was not cognizable. However, the court held that the respondent had the power to seize machinery and equipment, as the alleged offence was cognizable.

Thirdly, the court considered the legality of mining operations in forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government. The petitioner had argued that they had obtained all necessary approvals from the State Government, and that they did not require prior approval from the Central Government. However, the court held that no non-forest activity could be carried out in forest areas without prior approval from the Central Government.

In light of these factors, the court held that the FIR could not be quashed at this stage, and that the impugned order of the Deputy Conservator of Forests was quashed. The Deputy Conservator of Forests was directed to inspect and survey the impugned area and report any violations. The petitioner was given two weeks to rectify any violations found. If the petitioner had encroached, the lease granting authority was at liberty to order for stopping of mining activity and cancel the lease. Any seized machinery or vehicles must be released subject to the petitioner's undertaking. The writ petition was disposed of.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before carrying out any non-forest activity in forest areas. The court's decision also emphasizes the power of investigating officers and respondents to register FIRs and seize machinery and equipment in cases of alleged illegal activity. The court's decision serves as a reminder to individuals and companies to ensure that they comply with all necessary regulations and obtain all necessary approvals before carrying out any activity in forest areas.
