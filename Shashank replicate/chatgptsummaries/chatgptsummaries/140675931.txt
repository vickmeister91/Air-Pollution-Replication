Two court orders have been issued in relation to cases involving the possession of ivory articles in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first order pertains to a revision petition filed by Smt. Sushila Jain and others challenging an order passed by the trial court imposing a penalty of Rs. 50 lakhs for failure to deposit case property in court. The complaint was filed against the petitioners under Section 55 of the Act, alleging that ivory articles were recovered from their house and illegally returned to them by the Presiding Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal. The court rejected the petitioners' contention that they were not in possession of the ivory articles and upheld the penalty imposed by the trial court.

The second court order pertains to a complaint filed against the petitioners for violating Section 49 of the Act by possessing ivory articles. The court notes that the petitioners had previously claimed to have inherited the articles from ancestors, friends, and relatives, and therefore, cannot deny possession now. The court also upholds the penalty/fine of Rs.50 Lacs imposed by the trial court and allows the complainant to adduce evidence estimating the market price of the property during the trial. The revision petition filed by the petitioners is dismissed, and a copy of the order is sent to the trial court.

In the first case, Smt. Sushila Jain and others had filed a revision petition challenging the order passed by the trial court imposing a penalty of Rs. 50 lakhs for failure to deposit case property in court. The complaint was filed against the petitioners under Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, alleging that ivory articles were recovered from their house and illegally returned to them by the Presiding Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal. The petitioners had contended that they were not in possession of the ivory articles and had no knowledge of their existence. However, the court rejected their contention and upheld the penalty imposed by the trial court.

The court observed that the petitioners had failed to deposit the case property in court, as required under Section 55 of the Act. The court noted that the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that they were not in possession of the ivory articles. The court also observed that the Presiding Officer of the Debt Recovery Tribunal had returned the ivory articles to the petitioners without any authority to do so. The court held that the petitioners were liable to pay the penalty imposed by the trial court for their failure to deposit the case property in court.

In the second case, a complaint was filed against the petitioners for violating Section 49 of the Act by possessing ivory articles. The court noted that the petitioners had previously claimed to have inherited the articles from ancestors, friends, and relatives, and therefore, cannot deny possession now. The court also upheld the penalty/fine of Rs.50 Lacs imposed by the trial court and allowed the complainant to adduce evidence estimating the market price of the property during the trial. The revision petition filed by the petitioners was dismissed, and a copy of the order was sent to the trial court.

The court observed that possession of ivory articles is prohibited under Section 49 of the Act, and the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that they had inherited the articles from their ancestors, friends, and relatives. The court held that the petitioners were in possession of the ivory articles and were therefore liable to be penalized under the Act.

In both cases, the court has upheld the penalty imposed by the trial court and dismissed the revision petitions filed by the petitioners. The court has also sent a copy of the order to the trial court. The court has observed that possession of ivory articles is prohibited under the Act, and any violation of the Act will be penalized. The court has also allowed the complainant in the second case to adduce evidence estimating the market price of the property during the trial. These court orders serve as a reminder that possession of ivory articles is illegal and will be penalized under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
