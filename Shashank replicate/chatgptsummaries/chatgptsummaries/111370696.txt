In a recent court order, two accused individuals, Ashkar and Mohd. Yunus, were acquitted of charges filed against them by the Wildlife Inspector under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The complaint was filed against them for violating sections 40, 49, and 49(B)(1) of the Act, as they were found with ivory articles weighing 18.950 kgs and 7.450 kgs, respectively, without any legal source of procurement or license to deal in them. The prosecution examined several witnesses, but the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. However, the court found that the prosecution failed to prove the allegations against the accused and acquitted them.

The court order further states that no person can purchase or acquire any captive or wild animal, animal article, trophy, uncured trophy, or meat derived from them unless they are authorized to do so. The case in question involves the alleged possession of ivory articles by the accused, but the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the recovered articles were made of Indian ivory or imported ivory. The court found material contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses and acquitted the accused of charges leveled against them. The bail bonds of accused already on record were extended for six months, and the case property was confiscated to the state.

The court order was announced by ACMM (Special Acts) Devendra Kumar Sharma at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi on September 5th, 2013. The order pertains to a case between WLI and Ashkar and consists of 10 pages with a spare copy attached. However, no further information is provided.
