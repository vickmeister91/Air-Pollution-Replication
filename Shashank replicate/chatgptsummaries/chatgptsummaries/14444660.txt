In a recent case, Ms Umadevi and others filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash an order passed by the Civil Judge and JMFC, Kanakapura, in C.C.No.161/2007, which ordered to take cognizance of the offences. The petitioners argued that the alleged offences were non-cognizable offences, and the police did not obtain permission from the concerned Magistrate as mandated under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C.

The court considered the arguments of the petitioners and observed that the offences alleged were indeed non-cognizable offences. The court also noted that the police did not obtain permission from the concerned Magistrate as mandated under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C. The court further observed that the order passed by the Civil Judge and JMFC, Kanakapura, was therefore illegal and unsustainable.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the order, but reserved the liberty to the prosecution to file an appropriate complaint after complying with the provisions. This means that the prosecution can file a fresh complaint after obtaining permission from the concerned Magistrate as mandated under Section 155(2) of Cr.P.C.

This case highlights the importance of obtaining permission from the concerned Magistrate before taking cognizance of non-cognizable offences. Failure to do so can result in the order being quashed by the court. It also emphasizes the need for compliance with the provisions of Cr.P.C. to ensure that the legal process is followed correctly.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors to follow the legal process correctly and obtain permission from the concerned Magistrate before taking cognizance of non-cognizable offences. It also highlights the importance of compliance with the provisions of Cr.P.C. to ensure that justice is served.
