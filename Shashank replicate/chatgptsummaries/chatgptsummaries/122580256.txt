The first court order pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Sushil Kumar Singh against the State of Bihar and others. The petitioner sought a direction to close a brick-kiln being run by one of the respondents as it was in conflict with a statutory notification issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The court heard both parties and noted that the Emission Consent Order granted to the respondent was cancelled by the Board after it was found to be in violation of the notification.

The court observed that the respondent had not challenged the cancellation order before any appropriate forum and therefore, the order had attained finality. The court further noted that the respondent had not obtained any stay order against the cancellation order and therefore, the order was binding on the respondent.

The court held that the operation of the brick-kiln by the respondent was in violation of the notification issued by the Board and therefore, the petitioner was entitled to the relief sought. The court directed the respondent to close the brick-kiln and to comply with the notification issued by the Board.

However, the court also noted that the respondent was given the liberty to question the legality of the cancellation order before an appropriate forum. The court clarified that its order was without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the respondent in any such proceedings.

In the second court order, it is not possible to summarize it as it appears to be incomplete and lacks context.
