The Orissa High Court recently heard two writ petitions, W.P.(C). NO. 23228 OF 2012 and W.P. (C) NO. 1066 OF 2013, together and disposed of them by a common order. The petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 23228 of 2012 filed a public interest litigation against the State Pollution Control Board, Odisha, and others to implement an order under Annexure-3 and to direct the Collector and District Magistrate, Angul, to stop the operation of a plant. The court passed an interim order on 13.12.2012, and a Misc. Case was filed to vacate the interim order. The petitioner in W.P. (C) No. 1066 of 2013 filed a separate writ petition to declare a joint verification report and consent order as illegal and to quash them. The main objection of the petitioners was that the unit was causing heavy pollution in the area. The court heard the writ petition on merits despite objections raised by the opp. party no. 4.

The court order states that the opp. party no. 4 failed to comply with most of the conditions imposed in the trial run order and gave false information to the Board. The Regional Officer of the State Pollution Control Board directed the opp. party no. 4 to stop operation of the plant until compliance of all the conditions is made. The court orders a fresh inspection of the unit within two weeks to determine if the opp. party no. 4 has fulfilled the conditions and if there is no pollution caused by the unit, a fresh consent letter will be granted. However, if the unit causes pollution beyond the limits prescribed, permission to run the unit will not be granted until the conditions are fulfilled.

The court order states that the unit cannot be granted to the opposing party until they fulfill the conditions mentioned in the consent letter. The order passed by the Regional Office of the State Pollution Control Board is appealable before the Appellate Authority. The opposing party is allowed to operate the unit during inspection. The writ petitions are disposed of with the given directions.
