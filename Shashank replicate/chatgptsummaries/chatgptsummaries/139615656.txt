The Madras High Court recently heard a criminal revision petition filed by Mr. Anand Chikkaya Kunder and Mrs. Vichitra Kumari Nair, directors of Lax Bio Feeds Pvt. Ltd., against an order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate and Sub Collector, Cheranmahadevi District, directing the closure of their factory. The petitioners argued that they had obtained all necessary permissions and approvals for their factory, which processed bio-feed for poultry and fish feed. The court heard both sides and perused the available materials before issuing an order.

The court granted an interim stay on the closure of the factory, stating that it caused irreparable loss to the petitioners. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board later granted consent to establish the industry. However, the first respondent passed an impugned order stating that the court directed them to pass fresh orders. The petitioners argued that the first respondent did not follow the prescribed procedure and that the impugned order was passed without giving reasonable opportunity, violating the principles of natural justice. The respondents argued that the factory caused environmental hazards and pollution, and that the first respondent had the power to prevent parties causing disturbance to the public. The court is yet to make a decision.

The court order is an interim order regarding a conditional order for the removal of a nuisance. The court determines that the order passed by the first respondent is a conditional order and therefore, the revision petition filed by the revision petitioners is maintainable. The court also finds that no reasonable opportunity was given to the petitioners to put forth their case with relevant records before passing the impugned order. The court refers to Section 135 of Cr.P.C, which states that the person to whom the show cause notice was made is liable to respond, but in this case, the first respondent passed the order for closure of the factory belonging to the petitioners without giving them an opportunity to respond.

The court order refers to Section 135 of the Cr.P.C, which states that a person against whom an order is made must perform the act directed or appear and show cause against it. The court found that the first respondent had misunderstood the provisions and had not given the petitioners a reasonable opportunity before passing the impugned order. The court set aside the order and closed the connected CMP.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard a criminal revision petition filed by the directors of Lax Bio Feeds Pvt. Ltd. against an order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate and Sub Collector, Cheranmahadevi District, directing the closure of their factory. The court granted an interim stay on the closure of the factory, stating that it caused irreparable loss to the petitioners.

The court found that the first respondent had not given the petitioners a reasonable opportunity before passing the impugned order and set aside the order.
