The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition that was filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). The petitioner had requested to mark three documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C., which was rejected by the learned Judicial Magistrate at Alandhur. However, the court found that the documents were relevant and the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to mark them. As a result, the order dated 09.01.2018 passed in Crl.M.P.No.6165 of 2017 in C.C.No.144 of 2016 was set aside, and the petitioner was permitted to mark the documents. The petitioner was directed to make a fresh application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, seeking for a direction to mark these documents.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the relevant sections of the Cr.P.C. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. This section is often used by the prosecution to obtain documents that are in the possession of the accused or any other person. On the other hand, Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, the petitioner had requested to mark three documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The High Court found that the documents were relevant and that the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to mark them. As a result, the court set aside the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate and permitted the petitioner to mark the documents.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to mark the documents is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant evidence is presented before the court. The court found that the documents were relevant to the case and that the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to mark them. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties to a case be given a fair opportunity to present their case and evidence.

Furthermore, the court's decision to set aside the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate and permit the petitioner to mark the documents also highlights the importance of the High Court's inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. These powers are often used by the High Court to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the High Court exercised its inherent powers to ensure that all relevant evidence was presented before the court.
