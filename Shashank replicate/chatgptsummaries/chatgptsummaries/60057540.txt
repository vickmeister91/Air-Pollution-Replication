The court has issued two separate orders regarding non-compliance of court orders by the School Education Department and the respondents in a separate case. In the first order, the court has directed the Incharge Principal Secretary of the School Education Department to personally appear before the court to explain the non-compliance of an order and to point out the criteria for fixing the cut off date. The State Government had requested an extension of time to complete the exercise, which the court found to be a lackadaisical approach. The court reduced the cut off date to 20.9.2007 and emphasized the importance of obeying court orders in a timely manner. The court cited the doctrine of Contempt of Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court's observations on disobedience of court orders.

The court has taken a serious view of the non-compliance of court orders by the School Education Department. The court has directed the Incharge Principal Secretary of the department to personally appear before the court to explain the non-compliance of an order and to point out the criteria for fixing the cut off date. The court has also reduced the cut off date to 20.9.2007, which means that the department has to complete the exercise by this date. The court has emphasized the importance of obeying court orders in a timely manner and has cited the doctrine of Contempt of Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court's observations on disobedience of court orders.

In the second order, the court has found the non-compliance of directed stipulations within the prescribed time to be contempt of court, which undermines the dignity of the court. The respondents have been granted an additional period of one and a half months to comply with the court order, and failure to comply may result in consequences under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The matter will be reviewed on March 22, 2017.
