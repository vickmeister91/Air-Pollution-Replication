Going back to the first court order, the petitioner, Karnail Singh, had sought anticipatory bail in a case registered against him under Sections 66-E, 67, 67-A of the Information Technology Act 2000. These sections deal with the punishment for violation of privacy and publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form. The petitioner was accused of being involved in the trade of flesh with his wife and other girls, which is a serious offense.

However, the court declined his anticipatory bail on August 2, 2013, which means that he could be arrested at any time. The court must have found the evidence against him to be strong enough to deny him bail. Later, the court granted him interim bail until the presentation of challan as the investigation was at its final stage. This means that he was allowed to remain out of custody until the police filed the charge sheet in court.

The court also mentioned the details of the investigation conducted by the police, including the raid at the petitioner's house and the CFSL report. The CFSL report is a forensic report that is prepared by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory. It is a crucial piece of evidence in any criminal case, as it can provide scientific evidence to support or refute the prosecution's case.

Finally, the petition was disposed of on November 6, 2013. This means that the court had completed its proceedings in this case and had given its final decision. It is not clear from the given information what the final decision was, but it is likely that the case went to trial and the court gave its verdict.

The court found the evidence against the petitioner to be strong enough to deny him anticipatory bail, but later granted him interim bail until the presentation of challan. The court also mentioned the details of the investigation conducted by the police, including the raid at the petitioner's house and the CFSL report.
