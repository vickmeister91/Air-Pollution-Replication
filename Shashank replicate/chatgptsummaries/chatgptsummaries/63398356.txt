The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by Perfect Knit Process against the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board's rejection of their application to shift their dyeing unit to a new location. The appellant argued that their unit was an existing operating unit and that the government order prohibiting new industries within a certain distance from water bodies did not apply to them. The respondents argued that the order did apply and that the first respondent's earlier order granting permission to shift to other appellants did not apply to this case. The Tribunal considered the arguments and materials and formulated points for decision.

The court order sets aside the decision of the third respondent to reject the appellant's application to shift their dyeing unit to a new location. The appellant had been running their unit with necessary consent and had achieved zero liquid discharge. The court found it unreasonable to deny the appellant's request to shift their existing unit to a new location and set aside the decision. The court directed the third respondent to issue consent for the shift subject to certain conditions. There was no order as to costs.

The case revolves around the issue of whether the government order prohibiting new industries within a certain distance from water bodies applies to existing operating units. The appellant, Perfect Knit Process, argued that their unit was an existing operating unit and that the order did not apply to them. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the order did apply and that the first respondent's earlier order granting permission to shift to other appellants did not apply to this case.

The Tribunal considered the arguments and materials presented by both parties and formulated points for decision. After careful consideration, the Tribunal found that the government order did not apply to existing operating units. The Tribunal also found that the first respondent's earlier order granting permission to shift to other appellants did apply to this case.

The court order sets aside the decision of the third respondent to reject the appellant's application to shift their dyeing unit to a new location. The court found that the appellant had been running their unit with necessary consent and had achieved zero liquid discharge. The court also found it unreasonable to deny the appellant's request to shift their existing unit to a new location. The court directed the third respondent to issue consent for the shift subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision is a victory for the appellant, Perfect Knit Process, and for existing operating units in general. The court's ruling clarifies that the government order prohibiting new industries within a certain distance from water bodies does not apply to existing operating units. This ruling will provide relief to many existing operating units that were previously uncertain about the applicability of the government order.

The court's decision also recognizes the efforts of the appellant, Perfect Knit Process, in achieving zero liquid discharge. This recognition is important as it encourages other industries to adopt similar measures to reduce their environmental impact.

Overall, the court's decision is a positive development for the environment and for existing operating units. The ruling clarifies the applicability of the government order and recognizes the efforts of industries that are taking steps to reduce their environmental impact.
