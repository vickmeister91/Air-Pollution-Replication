The Orissa High Court recently received a writ petition from Sri Bhramarabar Das, who was seeking to declare Rules 35 and 36 of the Orissa Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2004 as violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner had been operating a stone quarry on lease basis from the Government of Orissa since 1993 and had filed an application for renewal of the lease, which was rejected by the government. The petitioner argued that the auctioning of mineral sources every year would lead to the closure of micro-level crusher units due to a lack of raw materials. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

In its order, the court stated that the sources of minor minerals specified in Item I(i) of Schedule III shall be sold or disposed of by public auction on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the auction sale notice by the competent authority. The court also ruled that Rules 35 and 36 of the OMMC Rules, 2004 are not violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution being arbitrary, discriminatory in nature and therefore, they are valid. The court also determined that the writ petition is maintainable.

The court emphasized the importance of transparency and fair competition in public auctions for the disposal of public property. The court noted that auction is the best method for leasing out state property to ensure fairness and transparency. The court further stated that no one has a right to renewal of government property and that public interest is the paramount consideration when disposing of public property. The court also discussed the procedure for granting leases of minor minerals and emphasized the importance of holding public auctions.

The petitioner in this case had leased a stone quarry, but their application for renewal was rejected as the lease had expired. The court referred to a report on the environmental impact of mining of minor minerals and recommended stricter regulatory parameters for such mining. The report suggested a cluster approach to mining, mandatory mine plans, and a separate corpus for reclamation and rehabilitation of mined-out areas. The court emphasized the need to give weightage to these recommendations for the conservation and development of minor minerals.

The court ordered State Governments and Union Territories to consider the recommendations made by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) regarding quarrying or mining leases. The Ministry of Mines' Model Rules of 2010 are also important from an environmental perspective. The court directed the States and Union Territories, MoEF, and the Ministry of Mines to comply with the recommendations within six months and submit their reports. The State Government is required to reframe the Minor Minerals Concession Rules in light of the model guidelines.

The court also provided a solution for the petitioner's case. The lessee may be permitted to quarry the mineral from the sairat source for at least five years. The petitioner's application may be considered by putting the sairat source to public auction, and if the petitioner agrees to match the highest bid, preference shall be given to him. The writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated above.

In conclusion, the Orissa High Court's order emphasizes the importance of transparency and fair competition in public auctions for the disposal of public property. The court also highlights the need for stricter regulatory parameters for mining of minor minerals and recommends a cluster approach to mining, mandatory mine plans, and a separate corpus for reclamation and rehabilitation of mined-out areas. The court's order directs State Governments and Union Territories to comply with the recommendations made by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the Ministry of Mines within six months and reframe the Minor Minerals Concession Rules in light of the model guidelines. The court's order also provides a solution for the petitioner's case, allowing the lessee to quarry the mineral from the sairat source for at least five years and considering the petitioner's application by putting the sairat source to public auction.
