In a recent court order, Bhuwani Deen was granted bail in connection with a wildlife protection case. Deen had been in jail since February 28, 2015, and the court found it to be a fit case for bail. The court directed Deen to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety in the same amount to ensure his presence in court during the trial.

It is important to note that the court did not express any view on the merits of the case. This means that the court did not make any judgment on whether Deen was guilty or innocent of the charges against him. The court simply granted him bail, which means that he will be released from jail while the trial is ongoing.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested and charged with a crime to be released from jail while they await trial. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person will appear in court when required and will not flee or commit any further crimes while they are out on bail.

In this case, the court found that Deen was not a flight risk and was unlikely to commit any further crimes while he was out on bail. The court also found that Deen had a strong incentive to appear in court, as his freedom was at stake.

To ensure that Deen appears in court when required, the court directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety in the same amount. This means that Deen will have to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he will appear in court when required. If he fails to appear in court, the money will be forfeited.

The court's decision to grant bail to Deen is significant because it means that he will be able to leave jail and return to his normal life while the trial is ongoing. However, it is important to note that the court did not make any judgment on the merits of the case. Deen will still have to face trial and prove his innocence in court.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Bhuwani Deen in connection with a wildlife protection case is an important development in the case. While the court did not express any view on the merits of the case, it found that Deen was not a flight risk and was unlikely to commit any further crimes while he was out on bail. The court directed Deen to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety in the same amount to ensure his presence in court during the trial.
