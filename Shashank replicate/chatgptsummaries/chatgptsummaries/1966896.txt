The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a revision petition filed by P. Jayaram against the State of Kerala and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The Board had initiated prosecution against Jayaram and others for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Jayaram had filed a petition claiming protection under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but the court rejected his contentions and dismissed the petition.

The court held that since the first accused, M/s.FACT Ltd., is not a government undertaking, Jayaram, who was on deputation with the company, did not require sanction under Section 197 for prosecution. The court also rejected Jayaram's contention that since the occupier of the premises was made an accused, its employees need not be arrayed as accused.

The case pertains to the violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, by M/s.FACT Ltd. and its employees. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board had initiated prosecution against the company and its employees, including Jayaram, for discharging untreated effluents into the environment. The Board had also issued a show-cause notice to the company, asking why its consent to operate should not be revoked.

Jayaram had filed a petition claiming protection under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides for the sanction of the government or its authorized officer for the prosecution of a public servant for any act done in the discharge of his official duties. Jayaram had claimed that since he was on deputation with M/s.FACT Ltd., which is a government undertaking, he was entitled to protection under Section 197.

However, the court rejected Jayaram's contentions and held that since M/s.FACT Ltd. is not a government undertaking, Jayaram did not require sanction under Section 197 for prosecution. The court also observed that the fact that Jayaram was on deputation with the company did not make him a public servant.

The court also rejected Jayaram's contention that since the occupier of the premises was made an accused, its employees need not be arrayed as accused. The court held that the employees of the company were responsible for the discharge of untreated effluents into the environment and therefore, they were liable to be prosecuted.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and its applicability to public servants on deputation with private companies. The court's decision also reinforces the principle of corporate liability and holds the employees of a company responsible for the company's actions.

The court's decision is also a reminder of the importance of environmental laws and the need to enforce them strictly. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution. The act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels and lays down the standards for the discharge of pollutants into the environment.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's decision in the case of P. Jayaram v. State of Kerala and Kerala State Pollution Control Board is a significant one that clarifies the scope of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and reinforces the principle of corporate liability. The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental laws and the need to enforce them strictly to protect the environment and public health.
