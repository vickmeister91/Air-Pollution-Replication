The court order pertains to a case where DSM Anti-Infectives India Limited challenged an order passed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner was accused of failing to install adequate and appropriate effluent treatment plants to contain pollutants in its trade effluent within the standards prescribed by the Board. The order required the petitioner to take several steps, including providing arrangements for segregation of different waste streams, providing a full-fledged incinerator for disposal of high COD wastes, toxic waste, aqueous waste, and solid hazardous waste, and taking adequate steps for installation of R.O. plant for treatment of effluents of effluent treatment plant and operationalisation of spray drier. The court granted time to the petitioner to dismantle all the Solar Evaporation Ponds (SEPs) on or before April 15, 2009.

The petitioner claimed that the RO plant was a condition for expanding its manufacturing capacity, but the Ministry of Environment and Forests did not impose any such condition in its permission dated 16.1.2007. The court set aside the order directing the closure of the petitioner's unit, but the petitioner must keep COD waste within permissible limits. The court also ordered the removal of 200 drums of hazardous waste within three months and directed the Chairman of the Board to ensure that the incineration facility is made operational at the earliest.
