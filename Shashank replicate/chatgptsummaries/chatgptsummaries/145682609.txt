The Rajasthan High Court in Jodhpur has issued three court orders that deal with the imposition of various cesses in the state. The first order, dated October 14, 2010, pertains to a case challenging the imposition of an urban cess under the Rajasthan Finance Bill, 2010. The petitioners argued that the levy was unconstitutional, while the respondents argued that the bill had already been enacted into law and that a similar levy known as 'Water Cess' had been upheld by the court in a previous case. The court ultimately upheld the imposition of the urban cess.

The second court order, dated August 1, 2013, discusses the imposition of a water conservation cess on electricity consumption in Rajasthan. The court determines that the cess is a tax on energy consumption and not a tariff on electricity, and therefore does not encroach on the power of the Commission. The court also finds that the Cess Act of 1977, which provides for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by certain industries and local authorities, is not encroached upon by the water conservation cess. The court upholds the validity of the levy of the water conservation cess and dismisses the writ petitions challenging it. The court also allows the petitioners to challenge the levy of an urban cess on appropriate grounds.

The third court order, dated November 8, 2011, lists 18 connected writ petitions filed by various companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The order does not provide details on the specific issues raised in the petitions.

The first court order, dated October 14, 2010, is significant as it deals with the constitutionality of the imposition of an urban cess under the Rajasthan Finance Bill, 2010. The petitioners argued that the levy was unconstitutional as it violated the principles of equality and non-arbitrariness enshrined in the Constitution. They also argued that the levy was not a fee for any specific service rendered by the government, but a tax on the citizens of the state. The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the bill had already been enacted into law and that a similar levy known as 'Water Cess' had been upheld by the court in a previous case.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, upheld the imposition of the urban cess. The court held that the levy was not arbitrary or discriminatory, and that it was a valid exercise of the state's power to levy taxes. The court also noted that the levy was not a fee for any specific service rendered by the government, but a tax on the citizens of the state. However, the court did not provide any further reasoning or analysis to support its decision.

The second court order, dated August 1, 2013, deals with the imposition of a water conservation cess on electricity consumption in Rajasthan. The petitioners in this case argued that the cess was a tariff on electricity and therefore encroached on the power of the Commission. They also argued that the Cess Act of 1977, which provides for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by certain industries and local authorities, was being encroached upon by the water conservation cess.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, held that the water conservation cess was a tax on energy consumption and not a tariff on electricity. The court noted that the cess was not linked to the amount of electricity consumed, but to the purpose for which the electricity was being used. The court also held that the Cess Act of 1977 was not being encroached upon by the water conservation cess, as the two cesses served different purposes.

The court upheld the validity of the levy of the water conservation cess and dismissed the writ petitions challenging it. However, the court also allowed the petitioners to challenge the levy of an urban cess on appropriate grounds. The court did not provide any further reasoning or analysis to support its decision.

The third court order, dated November 8, 2011, lists 18 connected writ petitions filed by various companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The order does not provide details on the specific issues raised in the petitions. It is unclear what the outcome of these petitions was, as the court order does not provide any further information.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court has issued three court orders that deal with the imposition of various cesses in the state. The court has upheld the imposition of an urban cess and a water conservation cess, while also allowing petitioners to challenge the levy of an urban cess on appropriate grounds. The court has provided limited reasoning and analysis in its orders, making it difficult to fully understand the basis for its decisions.
