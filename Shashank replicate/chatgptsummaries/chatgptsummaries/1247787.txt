Shankuntala Mehta filed a writ petition in the nature of public interest litigation to prevent the grant of mining leases in Langrapara and Domchanch Protected Forest and to declare the existing leases as illegal. The petitioner claimed that there had been indiscriminate diversion of forest land for non-forest use and large-scale deforestation and felling of trees due to mining activities. The respondent authorities countered that only eight leases had been granted in the entire Koderma District Forest Area, and all had been granted after following the norms and rules prescribed by the Forest Conservation Act. The court dismissed the writ petition, stating that there was no blanket bar on the grant of mining leases in forest areas, provided the mandatory rules were observed, and that the respondent authorities had followed the mandatory provisions of the Act and the rules.

The case of Shankuntala Mehta vs. the respondent authorities is a classic example of the conflict between economic development and environmental conservation. The petitioner, Shankuntala Mehta, had filed a writ petition in the nature of public interest litigation to prevent the grant of mining leases in Langrapara and Domchanch Protected Forest and to declare the existing leases as illegal. The petitioner claimed that there had been indiscriminate diversion of forest land for non-forest use and large-scale deforestation and felling of trees due to mining activities. The respondent authorities countered that only eight leases had been granted in the entire Koderma District Forest Area, and all had been granted after following the norms and rules prescribed by the Forest Conservation Act.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act provides for the establishment of a Central and State Forest Advisory Committee to advise the Central and State Governments on matters relating to the conservation of forests and the utilization of forest produce. The Act also provides for the constitution of a National Board for Wildlife to advise the Central Government on the selection of areas to be declared as national parks, sanctuaries, or closed areas and on the conservation of wildlife.

The court, in its judgment, observed that the Forest Conservation Act did not provide for a blanket bar on the grant of mining leases in forest areas. The Act only provided for the mandatory rules to be followed while granting such leases. The court further observed that the respondent authorities had followed the mandatory provisions of the Act and the rules while granting the mining leases in question. The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition filed by Shankuntala Mehta.

The judgment of the court raises several important questions regarding the conflict between economic development and environmental conservation. On the one hand, economic development is necessary for the growth and progress of a country. On the other hand, environmental conservation is necessary for the preservation of the natural resources and the protection of the ecosystem. The challenge, therefore, is to strike a balance between the two.

The Forest Conservation Act provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act recognizes the importance of forests in maintaining the ecological balance and provides for the sustainable use of forest resources. The Act also provides for the establishment of a Central and State Forest Advisory Committee to advise the Central and State Governments on matters relating to the conservation of forests and the utilization of forest produce.

The court, in its judgment, recognized the importance of the Forest Conservation Act in protecting the forests and the environment. The court observed that the Act provided for the mandatory rules to be followed while granting mining leases in forest areas. The court also observed that the respondent authorities had followed the mandatory provisions of the Act and the rules while granting the mining leases in question. The court, therefore, dismissed the writ petition filed by Shankuntala Mehta.

The judgment of the court, however, raises several questions regarding the implementation of the Forest Conservation Act. The Act provides for the sustainable use of forest resources, but the indiscriminate diversion of forest land for non-forest use and large-scale deforestation and felling of trees due to mining activities are still prevalent in many parts of the country. The challenge, therefore, is to ensure that the mandatory rules prescribed by the Act are followed in letter and spirit.

In conclusion, the case of Shankuntala Mehta vs. the respondent authorities highlights the conflict between economic development and environmental conservation. The Forest Conservation Act provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act recognizes the importance of forests in maintaining the ecological balance and provides for the sustainable use of forest resources.
