The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by the legal heirs of V. Krishnasamy Mudaliar, seeking renewal of lease of land measuring about 28.83.5 hectares equivalent to 71.22 acres in Minjur and Vallur villages in Thiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu. The lease was granted for a period of 99 years, which expired on 14.06.2004. The petitioners argued that they had a vested right to claim renewal of the lease and that the State Government cannot resume the land for public purposes. However, the court held that the petitioners do not have a vested right to claim renewal of the lease and that the State Government can resume the land for public purposes. The court also rejected the argument that the impugned order was a colourable exercise of power.

The court order states that the petitioner's claim for lease of government land cannot be accepted as no person has a vested right to get any lease of government land. The lands were resumed for public purpose and the state government had taken the decision to resume the lands for such public purpose. The petitioner's submission is negatived as there is no arbitrariness nor is it a colourable exercise of power. The writ petitions stand dismissed.
