The case in question involves a criminal petition filed by Sri B.M. Anand, who sought to set aside an order passed by the XLVII Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge and Spl. Judge for CBI cases in Bangalore. Anand's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. sought the production of an enquiry report dated 25-05-2010 submitted by Sri. Sameer Sahi CDI and Inquiry Officer. Anand is facing charges for the offences punishable under Sections 13(2) r/w 13(1) (e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and under Section 109 of IPC.

The court found no justifiable ground to entertain Anand's petition and rejected it. This means that Anand's request for the production of the enquiry report was denied, and he will have to proceed with his case without it.

It is important to note that Section 91 of Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court has the discretion to reject such an application if it finds no justifiable ground for it.

In this case, the court found that Anand had not provided sufficient grounds for the production of the enquiry report. It is unclear from the available information what specific arguments Anand made in support of his application, but it is likely that the court found them to be lacking in merit.

The fact that Anand is facing charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act and IPC suggests that the enquiry report may have contained information that could have been useful to his defence. However, without access to the report, Anand will have to rely on other evidence to support his case.

Overall, the court's decision to reject Anand's petition highlights the importance of providing strong and compelling arguments when seeking the production of documents or other evidence in a criminal case. Without such arguments, a court may be reluctant to grant such requests, even if the evidence in question could be crucial to the outcome of the case.
