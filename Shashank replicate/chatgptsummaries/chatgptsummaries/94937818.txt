The recent court order pertains to a case involving Idea Cellular Ltd, a telecommunication company, and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The company was served notices by the Pollution Control Board stating that their diesel generators fell under the category of "industrial plant" and required prior authorization under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the company objected to this classification and challenged the notices in court.

The court directed the Pollution Board to decide on the company's objection before taking any action under the Act and Rules. This means that the Pollution Board cannot take any action against Idea Cellular Ltd until they have considered the company's objections and made a decision on whether or not the diesel generators require prior authorization.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. It provides for the establishment of Pollution Control Boards at the central and state levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control air pollution.
