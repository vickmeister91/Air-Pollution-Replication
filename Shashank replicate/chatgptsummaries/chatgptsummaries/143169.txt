The court order in question pertains to a fundamental point regarding the procedure to be followed on the original side of a court. The case in question involves a suit under Order 37 of the Civil Procedure Code, which is based on a cheque given by the defendant. The defendant did not move an application for leave to defend the suit, and the plaintiff prayed for a decree to be passed forthwith. The question that arises is whether the Original Side Rules or the Civil Procedure Code should govern the original side of the court in the event of inconsistency.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, concludes that the Original Side Rules prevail on the original side of the court and not the Civil Procedure Code. The court notes that the Original Side Rules are a set of rules that have been specifically formulated for the original side of the court, and they are intended to govern the procedure to be followed in such cases. On the other hand, the Civil Procedure Code is a general law that applies to all courts in India, and it does not make any specific provisions for the original side of the court.

The court further notes that the Original Side Rules have been in existence for a long time, and they have been consistently followed by the courts. The court observes that the Original Side Rules have been formulated by the High Court in exercise of its powers under Article 225 of the Constitution of India, which empowers the High Court to make rules for the administration of justice in the court. The court notes that the Original Side Rules have been framed after due consultation with the Bar and after taking into account the peculiarities of the original side of the court.

The court also takes note of the fact that the Civil Procedure Code has been amended several times over the years, and some of these amendments have been made with a view to harmonizing the provisions of the Code with the Original Side Rules. The court observes that the amending Act of 1976, which is the latest amendment to the Code, has made no difference in this respect. The court notes that the amending Act of 1976 has not made any specific provisions with regard to the original side of the court, and it has not affected the applicability of the Original Side Rules in any way.

In light of these observations, the court concludes that the Original Side Rules prevail on the original side of the court and not the Civil Procedure Code. The court notes that the Original Side Rules are a set of rules that have been specifically formulated for the original side of the court, and they are intended to govern the procedure to be followed in such cases. The court observes that the Original Side Rules have been in existence for a long time, and they have been consistently followed by the courts.
