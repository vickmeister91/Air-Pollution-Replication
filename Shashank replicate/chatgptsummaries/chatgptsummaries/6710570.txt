The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Satish D. Darekar against the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation for issuing a notice under Section 53(1) of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 alleging that Darekar had carried out illegal and unauthorized construction of a hotel on land bearing survey no.51/3 of village Tathawadade, Taluka Mulshi, District Pune. The court upheld the legality and validity of the notice and declined to interfere in writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court directed the Municipal Corporation to start demolition of the building and granted a period of four weeks to Darekar to remove his belongings. The only substantive prayer in the present petition is to direct the Municipal Corporation from taking any action upon the notice until the appeal and stay application is heard.

The court has ordered Respondent No.1 to 4 to not take any action on the notice issued under section 53 until the appeal and stay application is heard. The execution, operation, and effect of the notice are to be stayed until then, and the stay will continue for a further period of 4 weeks if an adverse order is passed in the appeal. The Petitioner claims that the construction carried out by them is authorized and that the statement made in the notice is factually incorrect. They have filed affidavits and rely on a report recommending the regularization of all illegal constructions within the limits of the Municipal Corporation. The Petitioner has requested limited protection until the disposal of the appeal, stating that the structure is likely to be regularized.

The court order discusses a rejected development permission and a notice of unauthorized construction. The petitioner relied on a building permission granted in 2007, but it only covered an area of 2924.51 Sq. Meters. The court found that the entire structure subject to the notice was illegal and unauthorized because the petitioner did not obtain permission from the Collector. The court also notes that the petitioner was aware of the requirement for permission under Section 18 of the MRTP Act.

The court order states that the notice issued on July 17, 2013, regarding the construction of a hotel is completely illegal and unauthorized as the petitioner did not obtain permission from the Collector. The petitioner had only obtained permission from the Village Panchayat for a constructed area of 2924.51 Sq. Meters, which is unauthorized. The Assistant Director of Town Planning had recommended the plan submitted by the petitioner for approval, but the approval was never granted by the Collector. The Municipal Corporation rejected the petitioner's application for development permission on July 20, 2013. The court order also highlights the discrepancies in the petitioner's representations regarding the permissions granted by the Gram Panchayat. The earlier writ petition filed by the petitioner is affirmed on August 5, 2013.

The court order pertains to a petition filed by a petitioner seeking a writ mandamus or any other appropriate writ direction and order under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, 1950, directing the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 to consider and forthwith give the sanction to the Building Plan submitted by the Petitioner for making construction on the property. The court rejected the petitioner's plea as the construction was carried out without obtaining permission in accordance with Section 18 of the MRTP Act. The court also noted that the petitioner's conduct was already deprecated by the court in an earlier petition. The court referred to a judgment and order passed by a Division Bench of the court in Public Interest Litigation No.207 of 2010, which revealed an alarming state of affairs within the jurisdiction of Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (`PCMC') with over 66,000 unauthorized constructions.

The court order discusses the failure of the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to enforce urban planning legislation and take action against unauthorized constructions. The court strongly disapproves of the proposal to regularize illegal constructions and directs the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation to take immediate steps against all unauthorized structures. The court also cites a recent decision by the Apex Court on the menace of illegal and unauthorized constructions in the country.

The court order cites various cases where illegal constructions were ordered to be demolished and emphasizes the importance of planned development and basic amenities provided by public authorities. The court notes that a committee appointed by the state government has recommended the regularization of all illegal structures within the limits of the first respondent municipal corporation, despite there being over 66,000 unauthorized structures in the city. The court warns that such large-scale unauthorized constructions will place an unbearable burden on public amenities and deprive law-abiding citizens of their legitimate right to enjoy these amenities. The state government has not yet made a final decision on the recommendations of the committee.

The court order states that the State Government has not made a final decision on the recommendations of a committee regarding illegal constructions. The court emphasizes that the law cannot be overlooked and that the government must consider the findings of the Division Bench of the court. The court disapproves of the proposal to regularize unauthorized constructions and states that such toleration of structures encourages wrongdoers who treat the law with contempt. The court rejects the writ petition of the petitioner who carried out illegal construction without obtaining prior permission and orders the petitioner to pay costs of Rs. 50,000 to the State Government for welfare measures.

The court rejected a request for continuation of ad-interim
