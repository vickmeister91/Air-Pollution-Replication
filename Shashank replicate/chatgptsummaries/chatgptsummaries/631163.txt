The court recently issued an order in response to two petitions filed by N Thyagaraju and N Mahadev. The petitions sought to quash an order passed by the Magistrate in a cheque bounce case and to direct the respondent to pay the costs of the petitioner. The court found that the Magistrate had erred in directing the accused to produce documents to support the case of the prosecution. As a result, the court allowed both petitions and set aside the impugned order.

The case in question involved a cheque bounce, which is a common occurrence in India. When a cheque is presented for payment and is returned by the bank due to insufficient funds, it is considered a cheque bounce. In this case, the petitioner had issued a cheque to the respondent, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. The respondent then filed a complaint with the Magistrate, who directed the accused to produce documents to support the case of the prosecution.

The petitioners argued that the Magistrate had erred in directing the accused to produce documents, as it was the prosecution's responsibility to prove its case. The court agreed with the petitioners and found that the Magistrate had exceeded his jurisdiction by directing the accused to produce documents. The court noted that the accused had already denied the allegations made against him and that it was up to the prosecution to prove its case.

The court also found that the Magistrate had erred in not considering the evidence presented by the accused. The accused had presented evidence to show that he had issued a stop payment instruction to the bank, which meant that the cheque could not have been honoured even if there were sufficient funds in the account. The court found that this evidence had not been considered by the Magistrate and that it was relevant to the case.

In light of these findings, the court allowed both petitions and set aside the impugned order. The court also directed the respondent to pay the costs of the petitioner. This order serves as a reminder that it is the prosecution's responsibility to prove its case and that the accused has the right to present evidence in his defence. It also highlights the importance of considering all the evidence presented before making a decision.
