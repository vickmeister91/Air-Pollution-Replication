The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to three different cases, each with its unique set of circumstances and legal arguments. However, a common thread running through all three orders is the need to balance environmental protection and development.

In the first court order, M/s Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd and two others filed a writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India for the issuance of a writ of mandamus for shifting Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., Swaraj Division, and for its sealing until it is shifted. The petitioners also sought the provision of infrastructure like Storm Water Drainage System and Sewerage System and executing a Master Plan for Storm Water Drainage system along 200 feet wide Road dividing Sectors 114 and 115, Mohali.

The court discussed the importance of balancing environmental protection and development and cited various cases where the Supreme Court and High Courts have played an important role in preserving the environment and applying the doctrine of sustainable development. The court noted that the petitioners had not provided any evidence to support their claims of environmental damage caused by the industry. The court also observed that the industry provided employment opportunities and produced equipment for agricultural needs, which helped in the agricultural progress of the state.

The court emphasized the need to balance development and environment protection and suggested that the authorities empowered under environmental laws should be approached for redressal of grievances. The court also warned against unscrupulous litigants who file petitions with oblique ulterior motives.

In the second court order, a petition was filed to shift and seal a manufacturing industry due to alleged water and air pollution. The court rejected the petitioners' claims as there was no authentic data or evidence to prove the pollution caused by the industry. The court noted that the industry provided employment opportunities and produced equipment for agricultural needs, which helped in the agricultural progress of the state.

The court emphasized the need to balance development and environment protection and suggested that the authorities empowered under environmental laws should be approached for redressal of grievances. The court also warned against unscrupulous litigants who file petitions with oblique ulterior motives.

In the third court order, the court stated that industrialization is necessary for generating wealth, employment opportunities, and resources for the welfare of the people, as enshrined in the Constitution of India. The court dismissed a writ petition regarding the provision of stormwater and sewerage systems, stating that the petitioners were not serious about pursuing the matter. The court order was devoid of merit, and no costs were ordered.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of balancing environmental protection and development. The courts have emphasized the need to approach the authorities empowered under environmental laws for redressal of grievances and warned against unscrupulous litigants who file petitions with oblique ulterior motives. The courts have also recognized the importance of industrialization for generating wealth, employment opportunities, and resources for the welfare of the people, as enshrined in the Constitution of India.
