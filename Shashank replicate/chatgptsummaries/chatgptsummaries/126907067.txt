The court order pertains to a quarry in Kerala, India, where the appellant challenged an order by the Pollution Control Board withdrawing consent to operate the quarry due to its proximity to an Anganwady. The court found that the laws and procedures applicable to the issuance of the quarry license and the Environment (Protection) Act must be considered before deciding whether the withdrawal of consent is justifiable.

The court observed that the appellant had obtained a license to operate the quarry from the competent authority, and the Pollution Control Board had granted consent to operate the quarry after conducting an inspection. However, the Board later withdrew its consent on the grounds that the quarry was located in close proximity to an Anganwady, which is a government-run childcare center.

The appellant challenged the withdrawal of consent, arguing that the Board had not followed the due process of law and had not given the appellant an opportunity to be heard before withdrawing consent. The appellant also contended that the Board had not taken into account the fact that the quarry had been operating for several years without any adverse impact on the environment or the Anganwady.

The court noted that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides for the regulation of activities that are likely to have an adverse impact on the environment. The Act requires that any person carrying out such activities must obtain prior consent from the Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the appellant had obtained the necessary license and consent to operate the quarry, and the Board had not cited any specific provision of the Act that had been violated by the appellant.

The court also noted that the Board had not followed the due process of law before withdrawing consent. The court observed that the Board had not given the appellant an opportunity to be heard before withdrawing consent, and had not provided any reasons for its decision. The court held that the principles of natural justice require that the appellant be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse decision is taken against him.

The court further observed that the withdrawal of consent must be based on valid reasons and must be proportionate to the alleged harm caused by the activity. The court noted that the Board had not conducted any fresh inspection or assessment of the quarry before withdrawing consent, and had not taken into account the fact that the quarry had been operating for several years without any adverse impact on the environment or the Anganwady.

The court held that the withdrawal of consent must be based on a proper assessment of the impact of the activity on the environment and the Anganwady, and must be proportionate to the alleged harm caused by the activity. The court observed that the laws and procedures applicable to the issuance of the quarry license and the Environment (Protection) Act must be considered before deciding whether the withdrawal of consent is justifiable.

The court remitted the matter back to the learned Single Judge for disposal on merits. The court directed the learned Single Judge to consider the laws and procedures applicable to the issuance of the quarry license and the Environment (Protection) Act before deciding whether the withdrawal of consent is justifiable. The court also directed that the interim order granted by the court shall remain in force until the writ petition is disposed of.

In conclusion, the court order provides clarity on the principles of natural justice and the laws and procedures applicable to the issuance of quarry licenses and the Environment (Protection) Act. The court has emphasized the need for a proper assessment of the impact of activities on the environment and the need for proportionality in any decision to withdraw consent. The court has also stressed the importance of following due process of law and giving an opportunity to be heard before any adverse decision is taken against a person.
