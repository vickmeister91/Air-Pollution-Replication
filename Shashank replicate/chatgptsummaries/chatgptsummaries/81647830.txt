In a recent court case, a petitioner filed a petition requesting the trial court to comply with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and supply documents in a pending case. The government advocate argued that if the documents are voluminous, the magistrate can direct a person to inspect them instead of providing free copies. The court ordered that any application for documents should be decided based on the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and disposed of the petition.

The petitioner's request for documents in a pending case was the subject of the court's attention. The petitioner argued that the trial court was not complying with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which requires the court to provide copies of documents to the parties involved in a case. The petitioner requested that the court order the trial court to provide the documents in question.

The government advocate argued that if the documents are voluminous, the magistrate can direct a person to inspect them instead of providing free copies. The advocate cited Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which allows the court to direct a person to produce a document or to inspect a document in the possession of another person. The advocate argued that this provision should be used in cases where the documents are voluminous, as it would be impractical to provide free copies of all the documents.

The court considered both arguments and ultimately ordered that any application for documents should be decided based on the provisions of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows the court to direct a person to produce a document or to inspect a document in the possession of another person. However, the court also noted that Section 207 of the Cr.P.C. requires the court to provide copies of documents to the parties involved in a case. The court held that any application for documents should be decided based on these provisions and disposed of the petition.

In summary, the court ordered that any application for documents should be decided based on the provisions of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows the court to direct a person to produce a document or to inspect a document in the possession of another person. However, the court also noted that Section 207 of the Cr.P.C. requires the court to provide copies of documents to the parties involved in a case. The court held that any application for documents should be decided based on these provisions and disposed of the petition.
