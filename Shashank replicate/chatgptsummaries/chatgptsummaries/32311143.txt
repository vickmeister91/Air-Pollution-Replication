The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed by Bhagat Singh and others, both related to land disputes in Village Bhaati Kalan. In the first petition, the petitioners claimed rights to land in the village and alleged that the respondents attempted to demolish a part of the structure on the land in question but were prevented by physical resistance. The second petition sought the quashing of a notification dated 04.04.1996 published in the Delhi Gazette, which declared the land of the Gaon Sabha falling in the 'Ridge' area as surplus land and excluded it from vesting in the Gaon Sabha.

The court notes that the notification was in pursuance of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and dismisses the second writ petition. The court finds that the petitioners have failed to establish any legal right to the land in question and that the notification was issued in accordance with the law. The court also notes that the petitioners have failed to produce any evidence to support their claim that the land in question was not part of the Ridge area.

In the first writ petition, the court finds that the petitioners have failed to establish their claim to the land in question. The court notes that the land in question is a forest area and is meant for collective enjoyment and not for individual use. The court finds that the petitioners are encroachers on government land and dismisses their petition to prevent the government from taking over possession of the land.

The court orders the petitioners to pay costs of Rs. 10,000 in the second writ petition. The court notes that the petitioners have filed the writ petition without any basis and have wasted the time of the court. The court also notes that the petitioners have failed to produce any evidence to support their claim that the land in question was not part of the Ridge area.

In conclusion, the court order dismisses both writ petitions filed by Bhagat Singh and others related to land disputes in Village Bhaati Kalan. The court finds that the petitioners have failed to establish any legal right to the land in question and that the notification declaring the land of the Gaon Sabha falling in the 'Ridge' area as surplus land and excluding it from vesting in the Gaon Sabha was issued in accordance with the law. The court also orders the petitioners to pay costs of Rs. 10,000 in the second writ petition for filing a baseless petition.
