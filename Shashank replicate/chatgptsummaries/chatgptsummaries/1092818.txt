The court order pertains to the issue of large-scale misuse of residential properties for commercial purposes in Delhi. The court examines the power of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to seal properties being misused and whether they have the power to do so under the DMC Act and Delhi Development Act. The court also notes the apathy of the MCD in implementing laws and protecting citizens' fundamental rights. The court orders directions to be issued in respect of residential properties used illegally for commercial purposes.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act related to the sanctioning of building plans, the power to seal unauthorized constructions, and restrictions on the use of buildings. The court emphasizes the importance of following the Master Plan for town planning and the mandatory and binding nature of regulatory provisions. The court also clarifies that conversion of use, such as using a building originally constructed for residential purposes as a shop, falls under the definition of "to erect a building." The court ultimately reverses the judgment of the High Court and upholds the power to seal unauthorized constructions.

The court order discusses the power of the Commissioner of MCD to seal premises in case of misuser under Section 345A of the DMC Act. It also examines whether the Delhi Development Act grants the DDA the power to seal premises on account of misuser. The court concludes that the power of sealing in case of misuser under the Delhi Development Act depends on the statute governing the competent authority and that misuse does not come within the ambit of development. The court also addresses individual cases and directs the authorities to examine the facts before taking any action, subject to legal remedies available to the parties. The court also refers to a letter from the Ministry of Urban Development urging the authorities to take strong and prompt action against illegal constructions and encroachments in Delhi.

The court order instructs senior field officers to inspect their areas and take action against unauthorized construction. The court expresses concern over the rising number of unauthorized constructions and the suspected connivance of staff. The court directs the Chief Secretary and Commissioner of MCD to file specific affidavits dealing with each clause of a letter dated August 28, 2000, and to indicate the total encroached area in Delhi and the number of unauthorized/illegal constructions. The court notes that despite passing laws and repeated orders, enforcement and implementation are lacking, and action is necessary to check corruption, nepotism, and apathy towards citizens' rights. The MCD suggests four steps to stop misuse, including sealing blatant and obvious cases of large-scale misuse at the first instance. The court recognizes that parties later tamper with the seal and warns that they will be punished for contempt of court.

The court order pertains to the misuse of residential premises for commercial purposes in certain areas of Delhi. The court has stayed an ad hoc registration scheme introduced by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to regularize such illegalities. The court has directed the MCD to seal residential premises being used for commercial purposes within 30 days of public notice, starting with major violations on main roads. The responsibility of stopping the misuse lies with the owner/occupier, who must file an affidavit with the MCD stating that the misuse has been stopped. If the misuse is not stopped, sealing of the premises will commence, and electricity and water supply will be disconnected. The court has also directed the MCD to file a monthly status report on the action taken.
