The court order in question pertains to a criminal case filed against Madan Mohan Prasad Singh for violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner's counsel has argued that the court was not authorized to take cognizance of the case under Section 19 of the Act, which states that only the Central Government or authorized officers can file a complaint. 

The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a comprehensive legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to protect and improve the environment and to prevent hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants and property. The Act provides for the establishment of various authorities and bodies to carry out its provisions, including the Central Pollution Control Board, State Pollution Control Boards, and Pollution Control Committees at the district level.

In this case, the petitioner has alleged that Madan Mohan Prasad Singh has violated the provisions of the Act by carrying out certain activities that have caused environmental damage. The petitioner has sought the court's intervention to hold the accused accountable for his actions.

However, the petitioner's counsel has argued that the court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the case under Section 19 of the Act. This section provides that only the Central Government or authorized officers can file a complaint for an offence under the Act. The counsel has contended that since the petitioner is not an authorized officer, he cannot file a complaint in this case.

The court has granted three weeks to the opposite party to file a counter affidavit in response to the petitioner's arguments. The court has also stayed further proceedings until the next hearing. This means that the case will not proceed until the court has had an opportunity to consider the arguments of both parties.

The court has also ordered that the order be communicated to the petitioners through FAX at their cost. This is a standard practice in Indian courts, where orders are often communicated to parties through FAX or email. The court has directed that the petitioners bear the cost of this communication.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a criminal case filed against Madan Mohan Prasad Singh for violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The petitioner's counsel has argued that the court does not have the jurisdiction to hear the case under Section 19 of the Act. The court has granted three weeks to the opposite party to file a counter affidavit and has stayed further proceedings until the next hearing. The order has been directed to be communicated to the petitioners through FAX at their cost.
