In a recent court order, a group of writ petitions filed by individuals who were issued a show cause notice by the Forest Department for allegedly encroaching upon forest land by setting up temporary shops without authorization were addressed. The petitioners claimed to have been in possession of the land for several decades and sought regularization of their possession. The court found that the notice was arbitrary and violated principles of natural justice as the petitioners were not given an opportunity to be heard before being dispossessed.
