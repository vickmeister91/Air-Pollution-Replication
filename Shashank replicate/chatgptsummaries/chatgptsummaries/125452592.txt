The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving disputes over the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters related to environmental protection. The first case, between Liyakat Mahmud Circle and Sterling SEZ and Infrastructure Limited, involved a question of whether the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 bars the jurisdiction of civil courts in such cases. The court examined the relevant provisions of the NGT Act and concluded that the civil court's jurisdiction is ousted in cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved, and the NGT has the power to determine such disputes. The court dismissed the appeal by the original plaintiffs, upholding the lower courts' decision that the civil court had no jurisdiction to try the case.

The second case involved a similar question of whether civil courts can entertain appeals or settle disputes related to claims for relief or compensation that fall under the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. The court order states that from the establishment of the Tribunal under the Act, no civil court can entertain any appeal in matters that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over. Additionally, no civil court can settle disputes or entertain questions related to claims for relief or compensation that the Tribunal can adjudicate upon. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved, including enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment. The relief that the Tribunal can grant includes compensation, restitution of property damaged, and restitution of the environment. The court rejected the plaintiff's suit on the grounds that it fell under the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and not the civil court.

The third case also involved a dispute over the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters related to environmental issues under the NGT Act. The court order states that the civil court has no jurisdiction to try a suit related to environmental issues under the NGT Act. The court rejected the plaintiff's claim and confirmed the decision of the lower courts. The order concludes that no substantial question of law arises in the appeal and dismisses it summarily.

Overall, these court orders make it clear that the National Green Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over matters related to environmental protection, and civil courts cannot entertain appeals or settle disputes related to claims for relief or compensation that fall under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The relief that the Tribunal can grant includes compensation, restitution of property damaged, and restitution of the environment. These court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment and the need for specialized courts to handle such matters.
