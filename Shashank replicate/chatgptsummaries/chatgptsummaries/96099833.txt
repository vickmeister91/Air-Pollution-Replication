The Supreme Court of India recently heard several petitions related to environmental issues and construction projects. One of the petitions concerned illegal mining, stone crushing, and deforestation in the Rohtas region of Bihar. The Court reviewed a report by the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) and found that some of the recommendations made by the CEC were still under consideration and some actions were pending for a considerable period of time. The Court ordered the State of Bihar to file a detailed affidavit of the Chief Secretary with regard to the recommendations of the CEC within two weeks and listed the application for hearing on July 31, 2018.

In another case, the Ministry of External Affairs filed an application for permission to use forest land for the construction of buildings for the South Asian University in Delhi. The court allowed the use of 1.0789 Ha of Ridge Reserved Forest Land and 5.763 Ha of Morphological Ridge Area for construction, subject to certain conditions such as planting of trees and depositing 5% of the project cost. However, the court rejected the request to waive the condition of depositing 5% of the project cost. The matter was examined by the Central Empowered Committee, which gave its recommendations and conditions. The court accepted the report of the CEC and disposed of the application.

Finally, the court ordered the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) to submit its report within four weeks in the case of T.N. Godavaraman Thirumpad versus Union of India and others regarding the Delhi Development Authority and Siri Fort Sports Complex.
