The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by a man named Chhanga against the State of Madhya Pradesh. Chhanga had been convicted under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 for allegedly hunting a wild animal and sentenced to two years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000. However, Chhanga filed a revision on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to establish the relevant facts and that the investigation was contrary to the provisions of the Act.

Upon hearing the case, the court found that the prosecution had not proved that the seized meat was of a wild animal. As a result, the court quashed the conviction and sentence. This decision was based on the fact that the prosecution had failed to establish the necessary evidence to prove that Chhanga had indeed hunted a wild animal, as required by the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wild animals and their products, and provides for penalties for violations of its provisions.

In this case, Chhanga had been convicted under Section 51 of the Act, which deals with hunting in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. The section provides for a punishment of imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and also a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.

However, the court found that the prosecution had not established the necessary evidence to prove that Chhanga had indeed hunted a wild animal in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. The court noted that the prosecution had failed to establish that the seized meat was of a wild animal, and therefore, the conviction and sentence could not be sustained.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of establishing the necessary evidence to prove a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The Act provides for strict penalties for violations, and it is essential that the prosecution establishes the necessary evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the court order in the criminal revision case filed by Chhanga against the State of Madhya Pradesh quashed the conviction and sentence imposed on Chhanga under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found that the prosecution had not established the necessary evidence to prove that Chhanga had indeed hunted a wild animal in a sanctuary, national park, or closed area. This decision highlights the importance of establishing the necessary evidence to prove a violation of the Act and the need for strict adherence to its provisions.
