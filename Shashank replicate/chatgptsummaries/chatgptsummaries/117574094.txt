In the first court order, Smt. Anju Khanna and her husband, Ajay Khanna, filed a petition against Nirmal Maggo, the wife of the deceased tenant of a shop they own. The Khannas claimed that they needed the shop for a coaching institute to be run by Anju Khanna. The respondent, Nirmal Maggo, contested the petition on various grounds, including the ownership of the shop and the existence of alternative accommodation. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision, ultimately granting the Khannas' petition and allowing them to take possession of the shop.

Moving on to the second court order, the petitioners argued for eviction on the grounds of bona fide requirement. They claimed that a fresh petition can be filed after withdrawal of a previous one, and that all legal heirs of a deceased tenant do not need to be made parties to a petition for eviction. The court determined that the landlord has the right to determine the use of the tenanted portion, but this right cannot be arbitrary or whimsical. The respondent is entitled to leave to contest on some grounds, including the ownership of the tenanted shop. The court examined the evidence and determined that the respondent is the wife of the original tenant.

Finally, the third court order discussed various grounds for contesting a petition for recovery of possession of a tenanted shop. The court found that the respondent, who is the wife of the original tenant, is the appropriate party to be made the respondent. The court also noted that there are competing site plans regarding the availability of two shops on the ground floor, and trial is necessary to determine the truth. The court allowed the application for leave to contest on grounds (b), (c), and (e), as they disclose facts that could disentitle the petitioner from obtaining an order for recovery of possession.

In all three court orders, the issue at hand was the possession of a tenanted shop. The petitioners in each case claimed that they needed the shop for a specific purpose, while the respondents contested the petition on various grounds. The courts heard arguments from both sides and ultimately made a decision based on the evidence presented.
