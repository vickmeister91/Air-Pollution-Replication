The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order in a writ petition filed by Hardev Singh Akoi against the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner had filed an application seeking immunity under Section 40A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which was rejected by the respondent on the grounds of lack of locus standi. The petitioner had challenged this decision and approached the court seeking relief.

The court, after hearing the petitioner's arguments, set aside the impugned order passed by the respondent. The court observed that the order was passed without issuing any notice to the petitioner, which was a violation of the principles of natural justice. The respondent was directed to issue notice to the petitioner and pass a speaking order after hearing him.

The court's decision was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against him. The court observed that the respondent had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before rejecting his application, which was a clear violation of this principle.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the fundamental right of a person to be heard before any adverse order is passed against him. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice in all legal proceedings.

The court's decision also has implications for the protection of wildlife in India. Section 40A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, provides immunity to persons who have committed an offence under the Act, if they provide information leading to the detection of an offence or the arrest of an offender. This provision is important for the protection of wildlife as it encourages people to come forward and report offences against wildlife.

The court's decision ensures that the provision of immunity under Section 40A is not denied to a person on the grounds of lack of locus standi. Locus standi refers to the right of a person to approach a court or a tribunal for relief. The court's decision ensures that a person who has information about an offence against wildlife can approach the authorities and seek immunity under Section 40A, without being denied relief on the grounds of lack of locus standi.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by Hardev Singh Akoi against the Government of NCT of Delhi is a significant one. The court's decision upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that a person is given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse order is passed against him. The court's decision also has implications for the protection of wildlife in India, as it ensures that the provision of immunity under Section 40A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is not denied to a person on the grounds of lack of locus standi.
