The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect and improve the quality of the environment and prevent and control environmental pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of various authorities and bodies to carry out its provisions, including the Central Pollution Control Board, State Pollution Control Boards, and Pollution Control Committees.

Section 15 of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rules made thereunder. It provides that any person who contravenes any provision of the Act or any rule made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.

The court has allowed three weeks for the opposite party to file a counter affidavit. This means that the opposite party will have the opportunity to respond to the arguments made by the petitioner's counsel and present their own arguments in support of the court's jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offense under Section 15 of the Act.
