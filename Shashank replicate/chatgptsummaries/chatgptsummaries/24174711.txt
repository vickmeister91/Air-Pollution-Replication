In a recent court order, a bail application filed by six individuals who were arrested for illegal hunting of wildlife was dismissed. The applicants had been charged under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The defense argued that the charge sheet had been filed and the applicants would not commit any offense in the future. However, the prosecution opposed the bail application citing the criminal antecedents of the applicants.

The court considered both arguments and ultimately dismissed the bail application. The judge cited the criminal antecedents of the applicants as a reason for denying bail. The evidence collected against them was also a factor in the decision. The court believed that the applicants posed a risk to society and were likely to commit similar offenses in the future.
