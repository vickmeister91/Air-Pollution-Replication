In a recent court order, the petitioner Mohamad Ali filed a plea for bail in a criminal case related to various offenses under different acts. However, the court has not granted bail to Mohamad Ali due to the presence of articles related to a banned organization found in his house by the district police.

The court notes that the petitioner's counsel has withdrawn the plea for the second petitioner, Javed Ali. This suggests that Javed Ali may have been involved in the same criminal case as Mohamad Ali, but it is unclear why the plea was withdrawn.

The presence of articles related to a banned organization in Mohamad Ali's house is a serious matter and may have influenced the court's decision to deny bail. It is unclear what specific articles were found or how they were related to the banned organization.

The court's decision to deny bail to Mohamad Ali may also be influenced by the nature of the offenses he is accused of committing. The court order does not provide details on the specific offenses, but it is likely that they are serious enough to warrant denial of bail.

Overall, the court order pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner Mohamad Ali has been denied bail due to the presence of articles related to a banned organization found in his house by the district police. The court notes that the petitioner's counsel has withdrawn the plea for the second petitioner, Javed Ali, but it is unclear why. The nature of the offenses Mohamad Ali is accused of committing may have also influenced the court's decision to deny bail.
