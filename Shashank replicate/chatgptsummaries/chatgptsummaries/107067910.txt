The court has granted anticipatory bail to Rajendra Uikey in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant was accused of trespassing in a prohibited area of Kanha Tiger Reserve Core Zone and hunting fish in prohibitive time. The court allowed the bail application, directing the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer. The applicant must also make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required and abide by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. It also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference. The Kanha Tiger Reserve Core Zone is one such protected area, and any violation of the Act within its boundaries is a serious offense.

In this case, Rajendra Uikey was accused of trespassing in the Kanha Tiger Reserve Core Zone and hunting fish during a prohibitive time. The offense is a violation of Section 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act, which prohibits hunting or destroying any wild animal or depriving it of its habitat. The offense is punishable with imprisonment for a term of three to seven years and a fine of up to Rs. 25,000.

However, the court has granted anticipatory bail to the applicant, which means that he will not be arrested if he complies with the conditions set by the court. Anticipatory bail is a provision under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.), which allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of his arrest. The provision is meant to protect a person's liberty and prevent his arrest in a frivolous or vexatious case.

The court has directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the arresting officer. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the applicant that he will appear before the court as and when required. A surety is a person who undertakes to produce the applicant before the court if he fails to appear. The court has also directed the applicant to make himself available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required.

The court has further directed the applicant to abide by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. These conditions include that the applicant shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer. The applicant shall also not leave India without the permission of the court.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Rajendra Uikey in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant was accused of trespassing in a prohibited area of Kanha Tiger Reserve Core Zone and hunting fish in prohibitive time. The court has directed the applicant to comply with certain conditions, including furnishing a personal bond and one surety, making himself available for interrogation, and abiding by the other conditions enumerated in sub-section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. The court's decision is a reminder that the Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that must be enforced to protect our wildlife and their habitats.
