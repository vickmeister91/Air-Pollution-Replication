The court refers to the Bombay Civil Service Rules, 1959, which define "cadre" as the strength of a service or part of service sanctioned as a separate unit. The court also refers to the 1941 Resolution issued by the Government of Bombay, which provided principles for determining seniority between direct recruits and promoted officers.

The court order discusses a dispute between direct recruits and promotees in the cadre of Deputy Collectors in the State of Gujarat. The direct recruits claimed that the promotees were given seniority over them, which was unfair. The court examined the Recruitment Rules and concluded that promotions made between 1960 and 1962 were valid, but if promotions were made in excess of the quota set for the mamlatdars after rules in 1966 were made, the direct recruits had a legitimate right to claim that the appointees in excess of the allocable ratio from among mamlatdars will have to be pushed down to later years when their promotions can be regularized by being absorbed in their lawful quota for these years. The court also stated that the quota rule does not necessarily invoke the application of the rota rule, and seniority will depend on the length of continuous officiating service.

The court order discusses the seniority of employees in a government cadre and how it is determined based on length of continuous service. The court also gives directions for reframing the inter se seniority list. The court concludes that seniority is measured by length of continuous officiating service and that a periodisation is needed to settle the relative claims of promotees and direct recruits. The court also discusses the concept of regular appointment and how it applies to different categories of employees. The court finds that the interpretation of the words "promotees regularly appointed" in direction (d) in Chauhan's case was erroneous and that the High Court should have applied them to the facts before it instead of modifying them.

The Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court had held that certain appointments were not made in accordance with the rules, but the Supreme Court found this to be incorrect.

The court dismissed the appeals filed by the promotees and allowed the appeal filed by the State of Gujarat. The court also commented on the language issue in India and called for a common tongue to unite the country.
