In a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Nawal Sao against the State of Bihar and others, the petitioner sought direction to stop the operation of a rice mill in a residential area and to shift it to an industrial area or any other place outside the town. The Pollution Control Board had already closed the rice mill, and a counter affidavit had been filed stating that the mill had been established and operated without obtaining consent from the State Pollution Board. 

The court found that the petitioner's grievance had already been redressed and disposed of the writ petition. This court order highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and consents before establishing and operating any industrial unit. The State Pollution Board has been established to regulate and control pollution in the state, and it is mandatory for all industrial units to obtain consent from the board before commencing operations. 

The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition indicates that the petitioner's grievance had already been addressed by the Pollution Control Board's closure of the rice mill. The closure of the mill indicates that the board had found that the mill was operating without obtaining necessary consents and permissions. This highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining necessary consents and permissions before establishing and operating any industrial unit. 

The court's decision also highlights the importance of ensuring that industrial units are established in appropriate areas. The petitioner had sought direction to shift the rice mill to an industrial area or any other place outside the town. This indicates that the mill was operating in a residential area, which is not appropriate for an industrial unit. Industrial units should be established in designated industrial areas to prevent pollution and ensure the safety of residents in the surrounding areas.
