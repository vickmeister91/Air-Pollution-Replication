The Madras High Court received two writ petitions, one from S. Dakshnamurthy and the other from C. Thangarasu. Dakshnamurthy's petition requested the court to quash an order passed by the 7th respondent to sanction a sand quarry in R.C.No.100/Mines/Cuddalore/2018 dated 07.04.2018 and to restore the southpennaiyar river. Thangarasu's petition requested the court to quash the environmental clearance granted by the Ministry of Environment Forest & Climate Change for a proposed project in Cuddalore. The respondents in both cases included various government officials and departments. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order pertains to two public interest litigations challenging the order passed by the District Collector, Cuddalore, permitting quarrying of sand in Thenpenniyar river bed in SF No.1/3(P) over an extent of 4.80.0 Hectare out of 150.88.0 hectare in Enathirmangalam Village, Panruti Taluk, Cuddalore District. The petitioners contend that the impugned order granting permission to quarry sand has been granted without obtaining proper environmental clearance and is in violation of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Deepak Kumar's case. The Ministry of Environment and Forest has issued a notification requiring prior environmental clearance for certain projects or activities before any construction work or preparation of land is started on the project or activity.

The court order outlines the categorization of projects and activities into Category A and Category B based on their potential impacts on human health and natural resources. Category A projects require prior environmental clearance from the Central Government, while Category B projects require clearance from the State/Union territory Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The order also outlines the four stages in the prior environmental clearance process for new projects, including screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal. The Terms of Reference for the preparation of an Environmental Impact Assessment Report are determined by the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee concerned.

The court order outlines the process for obtaining environmental clearance for projects or activities. The Terms of Reference must be finalized within 60 days of receiving Form 1, and if not, the applicant's suggested terms will be deemed approved. Public Consultation is required for Category A and B1 projects, except for certain exceptions. The consultation process includes a public hearing and obtaining written responses from concerned persons. The final EIA report must address all material environmental concerns expressed during the consultation process.

The court order outlines the process for obtaining environmental clearance for projects or activities. The applicant must submit a detailed report addressing concerns expressed during public consultation. The Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee will appraise the application and make recommendations to the regulatory authority for either granting clearance or rejecting the application. The process must be completed within 60 days of receiving the final report. The order also includes a schedule of projects or activities that require prior environmental clearance.

The court order refers to an office memorandum issued by the Government of India in May 2012, which requires all mining projects of minor minerals, including their renewal, to obtain prior environmental clearance, irrespective of the size of the lease. Projects with lease area less than 50 ha, including those with lease area less than 5 ha, would be treated as category 'B' and considered by the respective State/UT Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority. The order also grants liberty to applicants to approach the Ministry of Environment and Forests for permission to carry on mining below five hectares, and the applications of such applicants should be disposed of within ten days from the date of receipt of the applications in accordance with the law.

The court order discusses a memorandum issued by the Government of India in 2013 regarding guidelines for granting environmental clearance to projects and activities. The memorandum categorizes Category 'B' projects into 'B1' and 'B2' and outlines the documents required for appraisal. The order also mentions the formation of an expert committee to examine these issues and the committee's recommendations. The order specifically discusses the categorization of mining projects of minor minerals as 'B2' and outlines the conditions for granting environmental clearance to such projects.

The court order discusses the regulations for granting environmental clearance (EC) for mining operations, particularly for river sand mining projects. It states that mining operations in a cluster of lease areas will only be allowed if the environmental clearance has been obtained for the entire cluster. It also outlines specific stipulations for river sand mining projects with lease areas between 5 and 25 hectares, including manual mining, restricted depth, and adequate transportation infrastructure. The order also mentions an amendment to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, which establishes the District Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and the District Level Expert Appraisal Committee for environmental assessments.

The court order outlines the constitution and functions of the District Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (DEIAA) and the District Level Expert Appraisal Committee (DEAC) for granting environmental clearance for Category 'B2' Projects for mining of minor minerals. The DEIAA and DEAC are required to follow the procedures specified in the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The DEAC functions on the principle of collective responsibility and the Chairperson must strive for consensus, with the view of the majority prevailing if consensus cannot be
