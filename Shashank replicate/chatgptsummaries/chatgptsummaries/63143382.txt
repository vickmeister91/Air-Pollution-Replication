The case involved a dispute between two companies, M/S Om Traders and M/S Jd Construction Corporation. The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. read with Section 106 of Indian Evidence Act for summoning goods receipt and cash book. The Trial Court had rejected this application, but the Revisional Court had allowed it. The petitioner argued that the Revisional Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in allowing the application, and therefore, the order should be quashed and set aside.

The court considered the arguments put forth by the petitioner and examined the relevant provisions of the law. It noted that Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.

The court observed that the Revisional Court had allowed the application for summoning the goods receipt and cash book on the ground that they were necessary for the purpose of proving the case against the accused. However, the court noted that the Trial Court had already considered this aspect and had rejected the application. The court held that the Revisional Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in allowing the application, as it had already been rejected by the Trial Court.

The court further noted that the Revisional Court had not given any reasons for allowing the application. It observed that the Revisional Court had merely stated that the application was allowed without giving any reasons for its decision. The court held that this was a serious infirmity in the order of the Revisional Court.

In light of these observations, the court allowed the misc. petition and quashed the impugned order of the Revisional Court. It restored the order of the Trial Court, which had rejected the application for summoning the goods receipt and cash book. The court held that the Revisional Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in allowing the application, and that its order was therefore liable to be quashed.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal case between M/S Om Traders and M/S Jd Construction Corporation. The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. read with Section 106 of Indian Evidence Act for summoning goods receipt and cash book, which was rejected by the Trial Court but allowed by the Revisional Court.
