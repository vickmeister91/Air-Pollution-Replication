In a recent court order, a petitioner challenged a summon issued under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) calling upon the petitioner to produce a document. The petitioner argued that the document cannot be produced since it relates to a property in which there is a civil dispute. However, the court dismissed the writ petition, stating that it is always open to the petitioner to approach the respondent police and state that the matter is a civil matter and the question of production of the document does not arise.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C empowers a court to issue a summon to any person to produce a document or other thing in his possession or under his control. The section is often used by investigating agencies to gather evidence in criminal cases. However, in this case, the petitioner argued that the document in question relates to a property in which there is a civil dispute and therefore cannot be produced.

The court, while dismissing the writ petition, observed that the petitioner has not made any effort to approach the respondent police and state that the matter is a civil matter and the question of production of the document does not arise. The court further stated that it is always open to the petitioner to approach the appropriate forum for redressal of his grievances.

The court's order highlights the importance of approaching the appropriate forum for redressal of grievances. In this case, the petitioner could have approached the respondent police and stated that the matter is a civil matter and the question of production of the document does not arise. This would have saved the petitioner the trouble of approaching the court and getting his writ petition dismissed.

The court's order also highlights the importance of understanding the scope of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The section empowers a court to issue a summon to any person to produce a document or other thing in his possession or under his control. However, the section does not override the provisions of any other law. Therefore, if a document is subject to a civil dispute, the court may not be able to compel its production under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case emphasizes the importance of approaching the appropriate forum for redressal of grievances and understanding the scope of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. It is always advisable to seek legal advice before approaching a court or responding to a summon issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C.
