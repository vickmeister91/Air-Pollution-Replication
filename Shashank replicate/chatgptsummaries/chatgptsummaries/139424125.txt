The Supreme Court recently dismissed an appeal in a property dispute case that involved the construction of a building without permission. The appellant had challenged the High Court's direction to demolish the building, arguing that it was based on an amendment introduced after the construction was completed and that the building was beyond 200 meters of the High Tide Line. However, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision and dismissed the appeal.

The case pertained to a property dispute in which the appellant had constructed a building without obtaining the necessary permissions. The High Court had directed the demolition of the building, citing violations of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification. The appellant had challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, arguing that the High Court's direction was based on an amendment introduced after the construction was completed and that the building was beyond 200 meters of the High Tide Line.

The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the appeal, stating that the construction was in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification and that the appellant was not entitled to any relief. The court held that the appellant had constructed the building without obtaining the necessary permissions and had violated the regulations governing construction in coastal areas.

The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification was introduced in 1991 to regulate development activities in coastal areas and to protect the coastal environment. The notification prohibits construction activities within 500 meters of the High Tide Line and restricts certain activities within 200 meters of the High Tide Line. The notification also requires that all construction activities in coastal areas be carried out with the necessary permissions from the concerned authorities.

In this case, the appellant had constructed the building without obtaining the necessary permissions and had violated the regulations governing construction in coastal areas. The High Court had directed the demolition of the building, citing these violations. The appellant had challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, arguing that the High Court's direction was based on an amendment introduced after the construction was completed and that the building was beyond 200 meters of the High Tide Line.

The Supreme Court, however, dismissed the appeal, stating that the construction was in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification and that the appellant was not entitled to any relief. The court held that the appellant had constructed the building without obtaining the necessary permissions and had violated the regulations governing construction in coastal areas.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions before undertaking any construction activities in coastal areas. The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification is a crucial tool for protecting the coastal environment and regulating development activities in coastal areas. Violations of the notification can have serious consequences, as seen in this case where the appellant was directed to demolish the building.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this property dispute case reinforces the importance of complying with the regulations governing construction in coastal areas. The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification is a crucial tool for protecting the coastal environment and regulating development activities in coastal areas. Violations of the notification can have serious consequences, as seen in this case where the appellant was directed to demolish the building. It is essential for individuals and organizations to obtain the necessary permissions before undertaking any construction activities in coastal areas to avoid legal complications and environmental damage.
