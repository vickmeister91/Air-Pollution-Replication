The Madhya Pradesh High Court has quashed a criminal complaint against Manu Anand, Managing Director of Cadbury India Ltd. (now known as Mondelez India Foods Private Limited), alleging offences under Sections 43, 44 and 49 of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution), Act, 1974. The court invoked its inherent powers under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and found that Anand was not the person in day-to-day control of the affairs of the factory of the company from where the industrial effluent is alleged to have been discharged. The court also noted that there was not even a whisper in the complaint that the alleged offence has been committed with the consent or connivance and/or due to neglect of the Director, Manager and Secretary or any other persons of the company.

In a similar case, the court found that Jai Kumar Nair was in charge of the day-to-day affairs of a factory belonging to a company and had ultimate control over the factory. The court allowed the petition and quashed the impugned order taking cognizance of the offense against the petitioner, who is the Managing Director of the company. The court held that the prosecution can initiate proceedings against Mr. Jai Kumar Nair, who has control over the affairs of the factory.

The court's decision in both cases was based on the principle that a Managing Director cannot be made an accused in the absence of any allegation of consent, connivance, or neglect. The court's interpretation of the law is that the Managing Director is not the person in day-to-day control of the affairs of the factory and cannot be held responsible for the actions of others.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the role of a Managing Director in a company and the extent of their liability. The court's interpretation of the law is that the Managing Director is not responsible for the actions of others unless there is evidence of their consent, connivance, or neglect.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of due diligence and compliance in companies. It is the responsibility of the company to ensure that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations. The court's decision emphasizes the need for companies to have proper systems and processes in place to ensure compliance and to avoid any potential legal liabilities.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's decision to quash the criminal complaint against the Managing Directors of Cadbury India Ltd. and another company highlights the importance of due diligence and compliance in companies. The court's interpretation of the law clarifies the role of a Managing Director in a company and the extent of their liability. The court's decision emphasizes the need for companies to have proper systems and processes in place to ensure compliance and to avoid any potential legal liabilities.
