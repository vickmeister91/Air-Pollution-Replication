Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane, a resident of Maharashtra, filed an anticipatory bail application in a case registered against him for illegal excavation of sand. The court granted him pre-arrest bail on the condition that he executes a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 and attends the investigating officer on specific dates. The court also ordered him not to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence. The case was adjourned to March 29, 2019.

The case against Issane was registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The police had received a complaint from the local residents about illegal excavation of sand from a riverbed. The police conducted a raid and found Issane and his associates excavating sand without any permission or license. The police seized the equipment and vehicles used for the excavation and arrested Issane's associates. However, Issane managed to escape from the spot.

Issane, through his lawyer, filed an anticipatory bail application in the court, stating that he was falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the illegal excavation of sand. He also stated that he was willing to cooperate with the investigation and that he had no intention to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, granted Issane pre-arrest bail on the condition that he executes a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 and attends the investigating officer on specific dates. The court also ordered him not to influence witnesses or tamper with evidence. The court observed that Issane had no criminal antecedents and that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to grant pre-arrest bail to Issane is in line with the principles of natural justice, which state that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that Issane has no criminal antecedents and that he is willing to cooperate with the investigation. The court has also imposed conditions on Issane to ensure that he does not abscond or tamper with evidence.

The case against Issane is a reminder of the rampant illegal excavation of sand in India, which has led to environmental degradation and loss of revenue for the government. The government has taken several measures to curb illegal sand mining, including the formation of special task forces and the use of drones to monitor the activity. However, illegal sand mining continues to be a major problem in many parts of the country.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant pre-arrest bail to Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane in the case of illegal excavation of sand is a welcome move. The court has taken into consideration the principles of natural justice and has imposed conditions on Issane to ensure that he does not abscond or tamper with evidence. The case is a reminder of the need to curb illegal sand mining in India and to protect the environment and natural resources.
