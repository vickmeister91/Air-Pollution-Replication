This court order involves multiple cases, including Suman Dubey vs Dr. Subramanian Swamy & Anr. The details of the cases are not provided in the summary. The petitioners and respondents are represented by various lawyers. 

The second court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed by Dr. Subramanian Swamy against Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and others for alleged fraud, cheating, and other offenses related to the National Herald newspaper. The Trial Court had summoned the accused persons, and the complainant had filed two applications under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to summon documents related to the case. The petitioners, who are some of the accused persons, filed petitions challenging the impugned orders that allowed the summoning of documents. The court heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and the principle of natural justice. The court states that a notice must be given to a person before any proposed action is taken against them, and the right to a hearing cannot be denied. The court also discusses the definition of a "document" and the circumstances under which Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. can be invoked. The court ultimately finds that the orders passed in the present case do not reflect any necessity or desirability for summoning the documents in question.

The court order states that a summons or written order can be issued to a person believed to be in possession of documents relevant to a criminal case, requiring them to attend and produce the documents. The power given under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is a general and wide power that can be exercised by the court at any stage of any investigation, inquiry, or other proceedings. However, the court must consider whether the production of the document is necessary or desirable for the purpose of trial. The party seeking the production of the document must demonstrate to the court that it is material for arriving at a just decision in the case. The court has to deal with this issue to satisfy itself as to the necessity or desirability of the documents sought to be produced.

The court order discusses the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings, emphasizing the necessity and relevancy of such evidence. The court also notes that the principle of natural justice requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before passing any order. The court finds that in the present case, no list of witnesses or documents was furnished, and the orders were passed in a casual manner without proper consideration of the facts. The court concludes that the orders were violative of the principle of natural justice and sets them aside.

The court order states that the High Court cannot pass a judicial order directing an investigation against someone without providing them with an opportunity to be heard, especially when the order affects their reputation. The order also states that if a judgment is pronounced without jurisdiction or in violation of natural justice, it can be recalled. The complainant argues that notice is not mandatory before passing an order under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., as it is the discretion of the Trial Court whether a particular document should be summoned or not.

The court order discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The learned Magistrate had observed that there were no materials before him to decide whether or not the production of any of the statements and documents named by the accused in his application was desirable or necessary for the purpose of the enquiry or trial. The High Court had interfered with the discretion conferred on the trial courts in the matter of summoning documents, which would unnecessarily impede the progress of cases and result in waste of public money and time. The court set aside the orders dated 11.01.2016 and 11.03.2016 and held that while passing the order under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents, if the other party has already joined the proceedings, it is entitled to be heard. The right of the complainant shall not be curtailed in any circumstance to move the fresh application during the pendency of the proceedings before the Court below.

In summary, these court orders deal with various aspects of criminal proceedings, including the scope and applicability of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., the principle of natural justice, and the requirements for producing documents or other evidence in criminal proceedings. The court emphasizes the importance of notice and an opportunity to be heard before passing any order and sets aside orders that were passed in a casual manner without proper consideration of the facts. The court also discusses the issue of summoning documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and holds that the other party is entitled to be heard if they have already joined the proceedings. Overall, these court orders provide important guidance on the proper conduct of criminal proceedings and the protection of the rights of all parties involved.
