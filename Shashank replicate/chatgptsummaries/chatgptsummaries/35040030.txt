Arun Kumar, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore, in Crl.M.P.No.1256 of 2015 (in Crime No.214 of 2014), dated 10.06.2015. The court dismissed the petition and directed the petitioner to produce the jewels before the court below, since the said properties/jewels are necessary for investigation. However, the court directed the court below to decide any petition filed by the defacto-complainant or by the petitioner for the return of the jewels purely on merits, after serving notice to all the necessary parties.

The case in question pertains to a complaint filed by the defacto-complainant against the petitioner, Arun Kumar, alleging that he had cheated her by promising to marry her and taking away her jewels. The police registered a case against the petitioner under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and initiated an investigation. During the course of the investigation, the police recovered some of the jewels from the petitioner and produced them before the court.

The petitioner, however, claimed that the jewels were given to him by the defacto-complainant as a gift and that he had not cheated her. He further contended that the jewels were not necessary for the investigation and that they should be returned to him.

The learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore, after considering the submissions made by both parties, directed the petitioner to produce the remaining jewels before the court. The court also observed that the jewels were necessary for the investigation and that they should be retained by the court till the investigation was completed.

Aggrieved by the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore, the petitioner filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. before the High Court of Madras. The petitioner contended that the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore, was illegal and arbitrary and that the jewels were not necessary for the investigation.

The High Court of Madras, after considering the submissions made by both parties, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner. The court observed that the jewels were necessary for the investigation and that they should be retained by the court till the investigation was completed. However, the court directed the court below to decide any petition filed by the defacto-complainant or by the petitioner for the return of the jewels purely on merits, after serving notice to all the necessary parties.

In conclusion, the High Court of Madras upheld the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore, directing the petitioner to produce the jewels before the court. The court also observed that the jewels were necessary for the investigation and that they should be retained by the court till the investigation was completed. However, the court directed the court below to decide any petition filed by the defacto-complainant or by the petitioner for the return of the jewels purely on merits, after serving notice to all the necessary parties.
