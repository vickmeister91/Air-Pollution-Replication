In a recent court order, the State of Karnataka emerged victorious in a case against M/S Goura Agro Pvt Ltd. The case pertained to a mining lease obtained by the petitioner on land adjacent to the Devambetta Extension State Forest. The respondent argued that the land fell within the forest area and no mining lease could be granted without prior approval. The court upheld the respondent's argument and stated that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 must apply to all forests irrespective of ownership or classification.

The court's decision was based on the need to protect forest lands and take appropriate action to reclaim them if leased out contrary to statutory provisions. The court reiterated that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 was enacted to protect forests and wildlife, and any activity that could harm them must be regulated and monitored. The court also noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permission for mining activity within the forest area, and therefore, the court found no merit in their petition.

The act provides for the conservation of forests and wildlife by regulating activities that could harm them.
