The court order WP(C)/7424/2018, issued on May 10, 2018, pertains to a challenge made against the demand of water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The matter has been deemed urgent and will be placed before the appropriate assigned bench the following week.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, is a legislation that was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities. The cess is meant to be used for the prevention and control of water pollution.

The challenge made against the demand of water cess under this Act is significant as it raises questions about the legality and validity of the cess. The petitioner in this case has argued that the cess is arbitrary and unreasonable, and that it violates the fundamental rights of the citizens.

The court order deeming the matter urgent indicates that the court recognizes the importance of this issue and the need for a speedy resolution. It is likely that the court will carefully consider the arguments made by the petitioner and the government before arriving at a decision.

The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications for the implementation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. If the court rules in favor of the petitioner, it could lead to a re-evaluation of the legality and validity of the cess, and could potentially result in changes to the way in which the cess is collected and used.

It is important to note that the issue of water pollution is a pressing concern in India, and the government has taken several steps to address this issue. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, is one such step, and it is meant to provide a mechanism for the prevention and control of water pollution.

However, the effectiveness of this Act has been called into question by the petitioner in this case, who has argued that the cess is not being used for its intended purpose, and that it is being collected in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner.

The court order deeming the matter urgent is a positive development, as it indicates that the court is taking this issue seriously and is committed to arriving at a just and fair decision. It is now up to the court to carefully consider the arguments made by both sides and to arrive at a decision that is in the best interests of the citizens of India.

In conclusion, the court order WP(C)/7424/2018, issued on May 10, 2018, pertains to a challenge made against the demand of water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977.
