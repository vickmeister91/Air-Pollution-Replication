In a recent court order, the Permanent Lok Adalath awarded compensation of Rs. 2,60,000 to the parents of a 9-year-old girl who was electrocuted allegedly due to the negligence of the Assistant Executive Engineer of the Electrical Section of KSEB. The court dismissed the parents' claim for enhancement of compensation and directed the respondents to make payment of the awarded amount within six weeks. Additionally, the court directed the respondents to maintain the electric line properly and safely to prevent such incidents in the future.

The case highlights the importance of proper maintenance and safety measures in the electrical sector. The negligence of the Assistant Executive Engineer resulted in the tragic death of a young girl, and it is crucial that steps are taken to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.

The court's decision to award compensation to the parents of the girl is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that those responsible for such incidents are held accountable. The compensation amount of Rs. 2,60,000 may not be able to fully compensate for the loss of a child, but it is a gesture of support to the family and a reminder to those in positions of responsibility to take their duties seriously.

However, the court's dismissal of the parents' claim for enhancement of compensation may be seen as a missed opportunity to send a stronger message to those responsible for such incidents. The court could have considered increasing the compensation amount to reflect the severity of the incident and to act as a deterrent to others.

Nevertheless, the court's direction to the respondents to maintain the electric line properly and safely is a crucial step towards preventing such incidents in the future. It is essential that those responsible for maintaining electrical infrastructure take their duties seriously and ensure that safety measures are in place to prevent accidents.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of safety measures and proper maintenance in the electrical sector. It is crucial that those responsible for maintaining electrical infrastructure take their duties seriously and ensure that safety measures are in place to prevent accidents. The compensation awarded to the parents of the girl is a step in the right direction towards holding those responsible for such incidents accountable, but more needs to be done to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
