The court order in question pertains to a cr. misc. petition filed by a petitioner under Section 482Cr.P.C. The petitioner had requested the summoning of an inquiry report and statements recorded by the Divisional Commissioner, Ajmer, which he claimed were necessary for a fair trial. The petitioner had earlier filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in a trial of a criminal case, which was rejected by the court. The petitioner then filed the present petition to quash the order rejecting his application.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court noted that the petitioner's application was baseless and intended to delay the trial. The court also observed that the inquiry report and statements were not relevant to the trial and could not be presumed to contain statements from injured persons.

The court's decision was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the petitioner had failed to establish the relevance of the inquiry report and statements to the trial. The court observed that the petitioner had not provided any evidence to show that the inquiry report and statements contained information that was necessary for a fair trial. The court also noted that the petitioner had not explained how the inquiry report and statements were related to the charges against him.

Secondly, the court observed that the petitioner's application was intended to delay the trial. The court noted that the petitioner had filed the application after the trial had already commenced, and that the application was filed at a time when the prosecution was about to close its case. The court observed that the petitioner had not provided any valid reason for the delay in filing the application.

Thirdly, the court observed that the inquiry report and statements were not relevant to the trial. The court noted that the inquiry report related to a separate incident, which was not connected to the charges against the petitioner. The court also observed that the statements recorded by the Divisional Commissioner were not admissible as evidence in the trial, as they were not recorded in the presence of the accused.

In light of these factors, the court dismissed the petition. The court observed that the petitioner's application was baseless and intended to delay the trial. The court also noted that the inquiry report and statements were not relevant to the trial and could not be presumed to contain statements from injured persons.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and evidence presented by both parties. The court's decision was guided by the principles of fairness and justice, and was intended to ensure that the trial proceeded in a timely and efficient manner. While the petitioner's application was dismissed, the court's decision was based on a thorough analysis of the relevant legal and factual issues, and was intended to ensure that justice was served in the case.
