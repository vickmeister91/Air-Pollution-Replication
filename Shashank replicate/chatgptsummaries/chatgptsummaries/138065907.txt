The first court order pertains to a case where the petitioner had requested the exclusion of his land from the notifications issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. The land was to be acquired for the development of an Integrated Sewerage and Solid Waste Management System for abatement of pollution of rivers Kuakhai and Daya at Bhubaneswar. The petitioner's land was not mentioned in the letter issued by the Board. The petitioner challenged the acquisition of land, but the court dismissed the writ application holding that public interest must be given utmost priority. The present writ application has been filed with identical prayer, and the court held that the present writ application is barred by the principle of res judicata.

The second court order discusses the principle of res judicata, which means that a matter that has already been decided by a court cannot be re-litigated. The court cites various cases and explains that the doctrine of res judicata is based on the need for finality in legal proceedings and to prevent endless litigation. The court then applies this principle to the case at hand and dismisses the writ application as an abuse of process of the court, with a cost of Rs.10,000.

The Land Acquisition Act, 1984, is a law that allows the government to acquire land for public purposes such as building roads, railways, airports, and other infrastructure projects. The Act provides for compensation to be paid to the landowners whose land is acquired. However, the Act has been criticized for being unfair to landowners, as they often receive inadequate compensation for their land.

In the first court order, the petitioner had challenged the acquisition of his land for the development of an Integrated Sewerage and Solid Waste Management System. The petitioner had argued that his land was not mentioned in the letter issued by the Board, and therefore, the acquisition was illegal. However, the court dismissed the writ application, holding that public interest must be given utmost priority. The court observed that the development of the Integrated Sewerage and Solid Waste Management System was a public purpose, and the acquisition of land was necessary for the project.

The petitioner had filed a second writ application with identical prayer, but the court held that the present writ application is barred by the principle of res judicata. The court explained that the doctrine of res judicata is based on the need for finality in legal proceedings and to prevent endless litigation. The court cited various cases to support its decision and held that the present writ application was an abuse of process of the court.

The second court order is significant as it discusses the principle of res judicata, which is an important principle in the legal system. The principle of res judicata ensures that there is finality in legal proceedings and prevents endless litigation. The court observed that the petitioner had already challenged the acquisition of his land in the first writ application, and the court had dismissed the application. Therefore, the petitioner could not file a second writ application with identical prayer, as it was barred by the principle of res judicata.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of the principle of res judicata in the legal system. The principle ensures that there is finality in legal proceedings and prevents endless litigation. The court observed that public interest must be given utmost priority in cases where land is acquired for public purposes. The court also held that the present writ application was an abuse of process of the court and dismissed it with a cost of Rs.10,000.
