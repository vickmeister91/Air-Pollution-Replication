The court order pertains to three writ appeals filed against a common order passed in three writ petitions. The petitioners had prayed for a Writ of Certiorari to quash a notification issued by the Union of India, represented by its Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, which had amended the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 by including various species to the schedule. The petitioners were engaged in the manufacture of lime and were using a hard, white calcareous substance called 'coral' which was collected by fisherfolk and sold to them. The notification had warned of legal action under the Act against the purchase, transportation, or use of any kind of coral. The court heard the arguments of both parties and referred to various provisions of the Act before delivering the judgment.

The court order discusses the interpretation and application of the Wild Life (Protection) Act in relation to the collection and use of coral reef fragments. The court concludes that if the fragments are collected from the sea shore and not through destructive means, and are not living organisms, they do not fall under the definition of "wildlife" or "animal article" in the Act. The court also notes that the Act was enacted to protect India's wildlife from destruction, and that the collection of coral reef fragments for the manufacture of lime does not harm the marine ecosystem or endanger the livelihoods of those who depend on it.

The court order states that the removal of dead coral reef fragments does not violate any provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, as long as live animals are not caught and killed. The court interprets the word "coral" to only refer to the living marine organism, not the dead outer skeleton. The court upholds the decision of the learned single judge and dismisses the writ appeals. The order is copied to various government officials.

The court order is a significant development in the interpretation and application of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act was enacted to protect India's wildlife from destruction, and the court's interpretation of the Act in relation to the collection and use of coral reef fragments is a welcome development.
