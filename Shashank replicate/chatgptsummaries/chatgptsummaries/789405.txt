The court order in question is related to a Special Civil Application filed by Adivasis who were residing in villages that were covered under notifications declaring the area as a Wild Life Sanctuary. The court had issued an interim relief directing the respondents not to disturb the petitioners without making alternative provisions for rehabilitating them. However, the respondents failed to file any reply or bring on record any Rehabilitation Scheme for the petitioners even after more than 10 years.

The court has now directed the respondents not to dispossess the petitioners until a scheme for their rehabilitation is framed within three months. If the petitioners have already been rehabilitated, the Special Civil Application shall stand dismissed.

The case pertains to the displacement of Adivasis from their villages due to the declaration of the area as a Wild Life Sanctuary. The Adivasis had been residing in the area for generations and had been dependent on the forest for their livelihood. The declaration of the area as a Wild Life Sanctuary had led to their displacement without any alternative arrangements being made for their rehabilitation.
