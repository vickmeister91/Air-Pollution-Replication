The court recently granted bail to Jeevan Lodhi, who had been in custody since May 11, 2016, in connection with a wildlife protection act violation. The court did not comment on the merits of the case but considered the lack of criminal antecedents and the fact that the trial would take considerable time. Lodhi was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his presence at all trial hearings and comply with the conditions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The case against Lodhi pertains to a violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, which is a serious offense. The act aims to protect wildlife and their habitats, and any violation of the act can lead to severe penalties. In this case, Lodhi was accused of violating the act, and he was arrested and put in custody on May 11, 2016.

However, the court recently granted bail to Lodhi, taking into account certain factors. The court did not comment on the merits of the case, which means that it did not express any opinion on whether Lodhi was guilty or not. Instead, the court considered other factors, such as Lodhi's lack of criminal antecedents and the fact that the trial would take considerable time.

The lack of criminal antecedents means that Lodhi did not have any previous criminal record. This is an important factor that the court considers while granting bail. If a person has a criminal record, it is more likely that they will commit another offense if they are released on bail. However, in Lodhi's case, since he did not have any previous criminal record, the court felt that he was less likely to commit another offense if he was released on bail.

The fact that the trial would take considerable time is another factor that the court considered. Trials can take a long time to complete, and if a person is kept in custody for the entire duration of the trial, it can be a severe hardship for them. In Lodhi's case, the court felt that since the trial would take considerable time, it would be more appropriate to grant him bail so that he could be with his family and carry on with his life while the trial was ongoing.

However, the court did impose certain conditions while granting bail to Lodhi. He was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount. This means that he had to provide a guarantee that he would appear in court for all trial hearings and comply with the conditions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section lays down certain conditions that a person has to comply with while on bail, such as not leaving the country without the court's permission and not tampering with evidence or witnesses.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to Jeevan Lodhi, who had been in custody since May 11, 2016, in connection with a wildlife protection act violation. The court did not comment on the merits of the case but considered the lack of criminal antecedents and the fact that the trial would take considerable time. Lodhi was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his presence at all trial hearings and comply with the conditions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This decision by the court takes into account the seriousness of the offense and the need to protect wildlife, while also balancing the rights of the accused to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.
