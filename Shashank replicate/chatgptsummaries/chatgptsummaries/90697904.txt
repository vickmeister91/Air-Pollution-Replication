The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Smt. A Kavitha against Sri Rajesh Venugopal under Section 19(4) of the Family Court Act. The petitioner had filed a petition under Section 125 of Cr.P.C, which was dismissed by the trial court. The petitioner appealed against this order, stating that she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine her husband. The court allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back to the trial court, directing the respondent-husband to appear before the court on 25.01.2013 for cross-examination.

The case at hand involves a dispute between a husband and wife, with the wife seeking maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The trial court had dismissed the wife's petition, prompting her to appeal the decision. The wife argued that she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine her husband, which was a violation of her right to a fair trial.

The court agreed with the wife's argument and allowed the appeal. The court directed the respondent-husband to appear before the trial court on 25.01.2013 for cross-examination. This decision was made in accordance with Section 19(4) of the Family Court Act, which allows for appeals against orders passed under Section 125 of the Cr.P.C.

It is important to note that the court did not consider an application filed for the production of additional documents, as the main matter had already been disposed of. This decision highlights the importance of presenting all relevant evidence and arguments during the initial trial, as appeals may not always provide an opportunity to introduce new evidence.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of fair trials and the need for both parties to have an opportunity to present their case and cross-examine witnesses. It also highlights the role of appeals in correcting errors made during the initial trial and ensuring that justice is served.
