The Rajasthan High Court recently issued an order in S.B. Civil Writ Petition No. 9691/2009, which involved a challenge by M/s. Bansal Grit Udhyog to an order passed by the Raj State Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the Board alone is empowered under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the order had been passed by the Member Secretary, who had not been delegated the power to do so. As a result, the court issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders.

The case involved a dispute over the power to issue orders under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Act provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution, and establishes the State Pollution Control Boards as the primary regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing its provisions. Section 31-A of the Act empowers the Board to issue orders for the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry, operation, or process that is causing or is likely to cause air pollution.

In this case, M/s. Bansal Grit Udhyog had challenged an order issued by the Raj State Pollution Control Board, which had directed the closure of the company's stone crushing unit on the grounds that it was causing air pollution. The company had argued that the order was invalid because it had been issued by the Member Secretary of the Board, who had not been delegated the power to do so.

The court agreed with the company's argument, noting that Section 31-A of the Act clearly vested the power to issue orders with the Board alone. The court held that the Member Secretary, who was a subordinate officer of the Board, could not exercise the power to issue orders unless he had been specifically delegated that power by the Board. In this case, the court found that there was no evidence that the Board had delegated the power to issue orders to the Member Secretary, and therefore the order was invalid.

As a result of its findings, the court issued notice to the respondents and stayed the operation of the impugned order until further orders. The court's order effectively allowed M/s. Bansal Grit Udhyog to continue operating its stone crushing unit until the matter was resolved.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of ensuring that regulatory authorities exercise their powers in accordance with the law. It also underscores the need for clear delegation of authority within government agencies to avoid confusion and ensure that decisions are made by the appropriate officials. Overall, the court's order provides important guidance on the proper exercise of regulatory authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
