The court order pertains to the case of Kresh and Ramvilas who were in custody since February 4, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants' counsel argued that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case was not so grave as to require their continued custody. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on the given dates. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violations of the act can result in imprisonment and fines. Kresh and Ramvilas were accused of violating this act and were in custody since February 4, 2015.

The applicants' counsel argued that their clients were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case was not so grave as to require their continued custody. The counsel may have argued that their clients were not a flight risk and would appear before the court on the given dates. The court considered these arguments and allowed the bail application.

The court directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount. A bond is a legal agreement that requires the person to pay a certain amount of money if they fail to appear in court. A surety bond is a promise by a third party to pay the bond amount if the person fails to appear in court. The court required the applicants to furnish these bonds to ensure that they would appear before the trial court on the given dates.

The court order would be effective until the end of the trial. This means that the applicants would be released on bail and would not have to remain in custody until the trial is over. However, if they fail to appear in court, the order would become ineffective. This means that they would be considered to have jumped bail, and the court would issue a warrant for their arrest.

The court's decision to grant bail to Kresh and Ramvilas is significant because it shows that the court considered the arguments of the applicants' counsel and decided that they were not a flight risk. It also shows that the court did not consider the case to be so grave as to require their continued custody. This decision is in line with the principle of innocent until proven guilty, which is a fundamental principle of criminal law.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to the case of Kresh and Ramvilas who were in custody since February 4, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on the given dates. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective. This decision is significant because it shows that the court considered the arguments of the applicants' counsel and decided that they were not a flight risk. It also shows that the court did not consider the case to be so grave as to require their continued custody.
