The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the quashment of an order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Sidhi Link Court Rampur Naikin, District Sidhi in Cr.R.No.117/2018. The petitioner is the registered owner of a vehicle that was seized by the police for allegedly transporting sand illegally from a notified forest area. 

The petitioner had filed an application for the release of the vehicle on supurdginama, which was dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Rampur Naikin. The Revisional Court confirmed the order of dismissal. The petitioner then filed a petition before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, seeking the release of the vehicle.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, directed the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class to release the vehicle to the petitioner on the condition as the court deems fit. This decision was made after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the arguments put forth by the petitioner.

The petitioner had argued that the vehicle was being used for personal purposes and was not involved in any illegal activity. The petitioner also contended that the vehicle was being used for transportation of sand for construction purposes, and not for commercial purposes.

The Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Rampur Naikin, had dismissed the petitioner's application for release of the vehicle on the grounds that the vehicle was being used for illegal transportation of sand from a notified forest area. The Revisional Court had upheld this decision.

However, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, found that the petitioner had made a prima facie case for the release of the vehicle. The court noted that the petitioner was the registered owner of the vehicle and had provided evidence to support their claim that the vehicle was being used for personal purposes.

The court also considered the fact that the petitioner had already been deprived of the use of the vehicle for a significant period of time, and that the continued detention of the vehicle would cause further hardship to the petitioner.

In light of these factors, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Jabalpur, directed the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class to release the vehicle to the petitioner on the condition as the court deems fit. This decision provides relief to the petitioner and ensures that their rights as a registered owner of the vehicle are protected.
