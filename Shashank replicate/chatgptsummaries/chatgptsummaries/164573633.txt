The case of Rekha Kasana involved a challenge to the rejection of her application seeking exemption from personal appearance and the issuance of Non Bailable Warrants (NBWs) against her. The petitioner is a permanent resident of Canada and travels to India for trial purposes. The court granted exemption to the petitioner from personal appearance through counsel during the hearing of arguments on the application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and on framing of charge. However, the petitioner was directed to be personally present in court on the date fixed by the trial court for framing of charge.

The petitioner had challenged the impugned orders and the NBWs issued against her. The court set aside the impugned orders and recalled the NBWs issued against the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to exemption from personal appearance during the hearing of arguments on the application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and on framing of charge. However, the court also held that the petitioner was required to be personally present in court on the date fixed by the trial court for framing of charge.

The court relied on the provisions of section 205 of the Cr.P.C. which provides for exemption from personal appearance in certain cases. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to exemption from personal appearance during the hearing of arguments on the application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and on framing of charge as she was a permanent resident of Canada and had to travel to India for trial purposes. The court also held that the petitioner was required to be personally present in court on the date fixed by the trial court for framing of charge as it was a crucial stage of the trial.

The court further held that the issuance of NBWs against the petitioner was not justified as she had already appeared before the court through counsel and had also filed an application seeking exemption from personal appearance. The court held that the trial court had not considered the petitioner's application for exemption from personal appearance and had issued NBWs against her without any justification.

In conclusion, the court granted exemption to the petitioner from personal appearance through counsel during the hearing of arguments on the application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and on framing of charge. The court also directed the petitioner to be personally present in court on the date fixed by the trial court for framing of charge. The court set aside the impugned orders and recalled the NBWs issued against the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to exemption from personal appearance during the hearing of arguments on the application under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and on framing of charge, but was required to be personally present in court on the date fixed by the trial court for framing of charge.
