The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by V. Swaminathan against the Superintending Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer of the Thanjavur Electricity Distribution Circle. The petitioner had appealed against an order passed by the first respondent in 2011, which had assessed a loss of electrical energy and collected a sum of Rs. 12,000 from the petitioner. The first respondent had returned the appeal papers stating that no appeal would lie against the theft of energy. The petitioner had filed a writ petition seeking a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the order and direct the first respondent to entertain the appeal. The court heard the submissions of both parties and examined relevant provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The court order discusses the difference between Sections 126 and 135 of the Electricity Act, 2003. Section 126 deals with cases of unauthorized use of electricity, while Section 135 deals with theft of electricity. The court explains that Section 126 does not require mens rea, or criminal intent, and is primarily a civil remedy. The court also discusses the meaning of the term "unauthorized use of electricity" and concludes that it is not limited to the examples given in the statute. The court emphasizes that the purpose of the statute is to prevent unauthorized use of electricity and to prevent revenue loss. The court also explains that the term "means" used in the definition clause of Section 126 does not necessarily render the provision exhaustive and limited.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "unauthorized use of electricity" under Section 126 of the Electricity Act, 2003. The court concludes that the term cannot be restricted to the categories stated in the explanation and must be given a wider meaning to cover cases of violation of terms and conditions of supply and regulations. The court also discusses the procedure for provisional assessment and final assessment of electricity charges payable by a person found to be indulging in unauthorized use of electricity. The court notes that compounding of an offense is an admission of guilt and cannot be made under protest. The court also discusses the quasi-judicial nature of the assessment of loss to the supplier or licensee and the judicial nature of punishing the consumer for an offense under Section 135 of the Act. The court concludes that the consumer should be provided with an opportunity to challenge the assessment made by the quasi-judicial authority.

The court order states that any unauthorized use of electricity by a consumer will be presumed to be dishonest unless proven otherwise. The licensee or supplier can immediately disconnect the supply of electricity upon detecting theft and lodge a complaint with the police. The court can only take cognizance of an offense under this act upon a written complaint made by the appropriate government or commission or their authorized officer. The Supreme Court has explained the difference between Section 126 and 135 of the Electricity Act and the objective difference between the two sections. The court also discussed the interpretation of the provisions of the act and the distinction between Sections 126 and 135.

The court order states that once a consumer has chosen to compound an offense, they cannot retract their decision or challenge the assessment of civil liability. Judicial review is limited to the decision-making process and cannot re-appreciate evidence or substitute findings. The Electricity Act, 2003 allows for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission to frame regulations, including a procedure for passing provisional and final assessment orders. The Special Court is empowered to determine civil liability in cases of theft and the consumer has the right to challenge this determination in court. However, there is no provision to question the manner of computation of civil liability or the final assessment order. The court suggests that an authority be constituted to test final assessments made under Section 135 of the Act. The court quashes an order passed by the first respondent without affording the petitioner an opportunity of hearing and remits the matter for fresh consideration.

In summary, the court order discusses the writ petition filed by V. Swaminathan against the Superintending Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer of the Thanjavur Electricity Distribution Circle. The petitioner had appealed against an order passed by the first respondent in 2011, which had assessed a loss of electrical energy and collected a sum of Rs. 12,000 from the petitioner. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition. The court also discusses the difference between Sections 126 and 135 of the Electricity Act, 2003, and the interpretation of the term "unauthorized use of electricity" under Section 126. The court emphasizes that the purpose of the statute is to prevent unauthorized use of electricity and to prevent revenue loss. The court also explains the procedure for provisional assessment and final assessment of electricity charges payable by a person found to be indulging in unauthorized use of electricity. The court concludes that the consumer should be provided with an opportunity to challenge the assessment made by the quasi-judicial authority. The court also suggests that an authority be constituted to test final assessments made under Section 135 of the Act.
