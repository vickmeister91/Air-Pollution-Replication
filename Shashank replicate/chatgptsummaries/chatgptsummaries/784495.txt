The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the regularization of unauthorized constructions in urban areas. In the first order, the petitioner had constructed two floors without permission from the Municipality and sought direction from the court to regularize them under a government scheme. However, the court stayed the operation of the government scheme until it could determine whether it was valid under the Municipal Act and allied laws. The court noted that the government had no power to render a statute invalid by ordering wholesale regularization of illegal constructions. The government had issued a scheme for regularization of unauthorized constructions made up to 30th June 1998, but the court found that it needed to determine whether the scheme was intra vires the Municipal Act and allied laws before issuing any direction to regularize the constructions.

The second court order, dated 30-7-1998, outlines a government scheme for the regularization of unauthorized constructions made before 30-6-1998. The scheme applies to buildings that do not affect public interest or safety and are not on government, municipal, or local body land, surplus land, tank bed or shikam lands, or areas earmarked for public use. The scheme also requires consideration of fire safety, NOC from the Airport Authority, and structural stability for multi-storeyed buildings. The government has the power to grant exemptions or relaxations in specific cases or in general. The scheme is time-bound, and the deadline for filing declarations is 31-8-1998. The concerned authorities must consider each case on its merits before granting or rejecting applications for regularization. The court order emphasizes that the scheme is not applicable to unauthorized constructions made after 30-6-1998.

The third court order discusses the legality of a government-issued Building Regularization Scheme that allows for the regularization of unauthorized constructions made up to a certain date in urban areas. The court examines the various provisions under statutes that grant the government the power to grant exemptions and relaxations to building regulations and issue directions to civic authorities. The court concludes that the government has the power to issue the scheme, but it must be based on rational grounds and not be a capricious exercise of authority. The scheme has restrictions on which buildings can be regularized, and the penal amounts collected from regularization must be used for specific developmental works.

The fourth court order states that the penal amount collected from the regularization of unauthorized constructions will be kept in a separate account and used for developmental purposes like road widening, bridge construction, parks, and playgrounds with prior government approval. The government has chosen to regularize unauthorized constructions instead of demolishing them to avoid wasteful expenditure and hardship to the public. The court finds the regularization based on sound rationale and in the interest of the general public. The government's policy is justified as it considers the interests of the public and avoids hardship. The court vacates the stay of operation of the impugned G.O. and allows the WV MP No.2499 of 1998. The government may consider extending the date for submission of applications for regularization of unauthorized constructions.

In summary, the court orders discussed the regularization of unauthorized constructions in urban areas and the government's power to issue schemes for the same. The court emphasized that the government's exercise of authority must be rational and not capricious. The court also noted that the penal amounts collected from regularization must be used for specific developmental works. The government's policy of regularization was found to be in the interest of the general public and justified as it avoided wasteful expenditure and hardship to the public. The court vacated the stay of operation of the impugned G.O. and allowed the WV MP No.2499 of 1998.
