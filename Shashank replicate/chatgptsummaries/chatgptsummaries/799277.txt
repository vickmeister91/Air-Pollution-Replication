The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner to quash an order passed by the learned Munsiff in an application filed by the plaintiffs under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs had requested that the suit be stayed until the disposal of RSA No.298 of 2007, which was pending before the court. The learned Munsiff dismissed the application, finding that it was not necessary to stay the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The petitioner, however, was not satisfied with this decision and filed a petition to quash the order. The petitioner argued that the learned Munsiff had erred in dismissing the application and that there was a necessity to stay the trial of the suit until the disposal of RSA No.298/2007.

The court, after hearing both sides, dismissed the petition. The court held that there was no necessity to stay the trial of the suit until the disposal of RSA No.298/2007. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs had not made out a case for staying the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court also noted that the learned Munsiff had considered all the relevant factors before dismissing the application.

Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure deals with the stay of a suit. It provides that if there is a suit pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, in which the matter in issue is also directly and substantially in issue in another suit, then the latter suit shall be stayed until the disposal of the former suit. The purpose of this provision is to avoid conflicting decisions on the same issue.

In the present case, the plaintiffs had argued that the matter in issue in the suit was directly and substantially in issue in RSA No.298/2007. However, the court found that the plaintiffs had not made out a case for staying the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court noted that the mere fact that the matter in issue in the suit was also in issue in RSA No.298/2007 was not sufficient to warrant a stay of the suit.

The court also observed that the learned Munsiff had considered all the relevant factors before dismissing the application. The learned Munsiff had noted that the suit had been pending for a long time and that the plaintiffs had not made any progress in the suit. The learned Munsiff had also noted that the plaintiffs had not shown any urgency in the matter and that there was no likelihood of conflicting decisions on the same issue.

In light of these observations, the court held that there was no necessity to stay the trial of the suit until the disposal of RSA No.298/2007. The court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner and allowed the trial of the suit to proceed.

In conclusion, the court order in this case deals with a petition filed by the petitioner to quash an order passed by the learned Munsiff in an application filed by the plaintiffs under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court held that there was no necessity to stay the trial of the suit until the disposal of RSA No.298/2007 and dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner. The court's decision was based on the fact that the plaintiffs had not made out a case for staying the suit under Section 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure and that the learned Munsiff had considered all the relevant factors before dismissing the application.
