The court recently rejected Lokeshwar Singh Thakur's second bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for the offence punishable under Sections 09, 39, 40, 42, 51, 52 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution's case was that Thakur was transporting hunted wildlife in a Maruti vehicle, which was stopped by a forest guard.
