The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various companies and individuals against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials. The petitions relate to mining leases and forest clearances. The details of the petitions and the court order are not provided in some of the cases.

In one of the cases, a group of writ petitions were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area.

In another case, the court discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the present status of the diverted cluster shows that many mining leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested, and that the petitioner is still liable to pay the compensation.

In yet another case, the court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

In the final case, the court order pertains to a forest land proposal for a cluster area of 281 hectares, which includes mining leases. The mining lease holders have refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and are also refusing to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court has partly allowed the writ petitions and directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court has also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The details of the petitions and the court order vary in each case, but they generally involve disputes over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the calculation of Net Present Value (NPV) amounts. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The court has also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
