The case of Shivkumar S/O Ningaiah involves accusations of offenses punishable under Sections 366-A, 342, 376, 506 of IPC. In an attempt to gather evidence, Shivkumar filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C read with Sec. 73 of the Indian Evidence Act, requesting to take the specimen signature of the victim girl and note book containing her handwriting. However, the Sessions Judge rejected the application.

Shivkumar did not give up and appealed to the High Court. The High Court allowed the application and ordered the Sessions Judge to send the signature and handwriting of the victim girl to a handwriting expert at the cost of the petitioner/accused. This decision is significant as it allows for the collection of crucial evidence that could potentially prove Shivkumar's innocence or guilt.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C allows for the production of documents or other material objects as evidence in court. This section is often used in criminal cases to gather evidence that could prove the guilt or innocence of the accused. In Shivkumar's case, he requested the specimen signature and handwriting of the victim girl in an attempt to prove his innocence.

The rejection of Shivkumar's application by the Sessions Judge highlights the importance of judicial discretion in the Indian legal system. Judges have the power to accept or reject applications based on their interpretation of the law and the evidence presented. However, the decision of the High Court to allow the application shows that there is room for appeal and that the legal system is not infallible.

The High Court's decision to send the signature and handwriting of the victim girl to a handwriting expert is also significant. Handwriting analysis is a valuable tool in criminal investigations and can provide crucial evidence in cases where other forms of evidence are lacking. By ordering the handwriting analysis, the High Court is ensuring that all possible evidence is being considered in Shivkumar's case.

It is important to note that the cost of the handwriting analysis will be borne by Shivkumar. This is in line with the principle of fairness in the legal system, where the accused is responsible for providing evidence to prove their innocence. However, it is also important to ensure that the cost of evidence gathering does not become a barrier to justice for those who cannot afford it.

In conclusion, the High Court's decision to allow Shivkumar's application for the specimen signature and handwriting of the victim girl is a significant development in his case. It highlights the importance of evidence gathering in criminal cases and the role of judicial discretion in the legal system. The decision to send the signature and handwriting to a handwriting expert also shows the value of handwriting analysis in criminal investigations. However, it is important to ensure that the cost of evidence gathering does not become a barrier to justice for those who cannot afford it.
