The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chandigarh heard cross appeals against an order by the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-II, Ludhiana for assessment year 2007-08. The first appeal related to the disallowance of Rs.5 lakh out of a total disallowance of Rs.46,91,849 made by the Assessing Officer by resort to provisions of section 14A of the Act. The second appeal related to the disallowance of Rs.22,49,634 out of expenses relating to the payment made to PSEB for laying high power electric lines.

The Tribunal restricted the disallowance to Rs.2.5 lakh on a dividend of Rs.46,91,849 received by the assessee in consonance with the fact that the computation as per Rule 8D of the Income Tax Rules is not applicable in the assessment year 2007-08. The Tribunal also set aside the matter to the file of the Assessing Officer to apply the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of Sriyansh Industries Ltd. (supra) for the second appeal.

In another court order, the issue of the claim of the assessee to establish whether the amount spent was for bringing the asset into existence or it is mere work-in-progress was set aside. The court directed the Assessing Officer to apply the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Shreyans Industries Ltd. Vs. CIT while adjudicating the issue in the present case. The court restored the issue to the file of the learned CIT (Appeals) to decide the issue as per the directions given by the I.T.A.T. The court also discussed the disallowance of financial expenses relating to the exempt unit under section 80IA of the Act.

The third court order discussed various grounds raised by the assessee and the department in relation to disallowances made under different sections of the Income Tax Act. The court found that the issue of applicability of section 14A of the Act on the income of the unit claiming exemption under section 80IA of the Act was confused by the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer otherwise under section 14A of the Act. The court sent this ground back to the file of the learned CIT (Appeals) to adjudicate the same in proper perspective. The court also dismissed ground No.4 of the appeal as not pressed. The court allowed the appeal of the assessee partly. The court also discussed the disallowance made under section 40A(2)(a) r.w.s. 37 of the I.T. Act, 1961 by the Assessing Officer out of salary paid to Managing Director and found that the remuneration paid to Managing Director during the year was not excessive. The court allowed the ground of appeal of the assessee.

In the fourth court order, the court upheld the decision of the learned CIT (A) to delete the disallowance of purchases made by the assessee from its sister concerns. The court found that the disallowance was made on an adhoc basis without bringing on record any comparable instances. The court also dismissed the appeal of the department regarding the increase in the managing director's remuneration, as there was no basis for the disallowance made by the assessing officer. The appeal of the revenue was partly allowed.

In summary, the court orders discussed various appeals related to disallowances made under different sections of the Income Tax Act. The court set aside some issues to the file of the Assessing Officer to apply the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court. The court also allowed some appeals partly and dismissed others. The court found that some disallowances were made on an adhoc basis without bringing on record any comparable instances. The court also found that the remuneration paid to Managing Director during the year was not excessive.
