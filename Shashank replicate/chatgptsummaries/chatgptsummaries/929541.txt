The Supreme Court of India recently heard two cases related to noise pollution and its impact on the right to life enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. The cases involved issues such as the use of loudspeakers in religious and social events, firecrackers during festivals, and noise created by horns of engines and pressure horns in automobiles. The court defined noise as unwanted sound and recognized it as a real and present danger to people's health, causing physical and psychological stress. The court also acknowledged that while freedom of speech and expression are fundamental rights, they are not absolute and cannot be used to create noise that violates the right of others to a peaceful, comfortable, and pollution-free life guaranteed by Article 21. The court emphasized the need to regulate and eliminate noise pollution and issued directions in public interest.

The court order discusses the negative effects of noise pollution on human health, including hearing loss, interference with communication, disturbance of sleep, annoyance, and physiological effects such as increased blood pressure and heart attacks. The sources of noise pollution are identified as industrial and non-industrial, including road traffic, aircraft, railroads, construction, industry, noise in buildings, and consumer products. The court also specifically addresses the issue of noise pollution caused by fireworks during festivals, which has been found to exceed prescribed noise limits and have adverse effects on health. The court notes that other countries have enacted legislation to control noise pollution, and suggests that similar measures may be necessary in India.

The text also discusses various laws and regulations related to noise pollution in different countries. The laws include provisions for controlling noise levels in residential areas, setting noise emission standards for products, and regulating noise from factories and construction sites. The text highlights the need for effective implementation of these laws to combat noise pollution. The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 in India are discussed in detail, which categorize areas into industrial, commercial, residential or silence areas/zones and specify ambient air quality standards for noise. Violators of these rules can be punished under the Indian Penal Code.

The court order discusses various laws and regulations related to noise pollution in India, including the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code, Factories Act, Motor Vehicles Act, Law of Torts, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and Environmental Protection Act. The court cites several judicial opinions that recognize the right to live in freedom from noise pollution as a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court also mentions interim orders passed during the hearing of the case.

The court order recognizes pollution as a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution and noise pollution beyond permissible limits as a violation of that right. The court has passed several interim orders to ensure compliance with noise pollution regulations, including restrictions on the use of fireworks and firecrackers. The court acknowledges the difficulty in implementing noise pollution control measures in India due to a lack of infrastructure and awareness among citizens. The court also discusses the issue of firecrackers and suggests that the maximum permissible sound level should not be altered at the moment. The Department of Explosives has suggested controlling the noise level of firecrackers by specifying the size, shape, composition, and quantity of chemicals in the fireworks. The court suggests that a rule should be designed that is easy to implement and enforce.

The court order states that it is the responsibility of fireworks manufacturers to produce environment-friendly and noise-compliant fireworks. The government cannot fix norms regarding chemical composition and size of firecrackers due to infrastructure shortages. The court suggests fixing the maximum chemical composition for each firecracker to comply with the noise limits. Bursting firecrackers is prohibited between 10 pm and 6 am, and there will be no relaxation during festivals. The court also states that the restriction on bursting firecrackers does not violate religious rights under Article 25 of the Constitution.

The court order prohibits the bursting of sound-emitting firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am and suggests the use of color or light-emitting firecrackers instead. The Department of Explosives is directed to come up with chemical formulas for each type of firecracker and to classify them into two categories: sound-emitting and color/light-emitting. Manufacturers must label each firecracker with its chemical contents and comply with the noise standards of the country to which they are exported. The order also includes guidelines for controlling noise pollution from loudspeakers, vehicular noise, and general awareness campaigns. The court appreciates the assistance of advocates in formulating the guidelines.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has recognized noise pollution as a real and present danger to people's health and a violation of their fundamental right to a peaceful, comfortable, and pollution-free life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court has issued directions to regulate and eliminate noise pollution, including restrictions on the use of fireworks and firecrackers, and guidelines for controlling noise pollution from loudspeakers, vehicular noise, and general awareness campaigns. The court has also emphasized the need for effective implementation of laws and regulations related to noise pollution and the responsibility of manufacturers to produce environment-friendly and noise-compliant products. The court's order is a significant step towards protecting the health and well-being of citizens and ensuring a pollution-free environment.
