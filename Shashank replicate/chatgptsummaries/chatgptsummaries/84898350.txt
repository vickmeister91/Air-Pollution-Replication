The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of stone crushing units in the state. The petitioners, who are licensees and have valid licenses to run the stone crushing units, had filed a writ petition seeking to quash closure notices issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board. The court notes that this writ action is similar to a previous writ action where the closure notice was quashed and a writ of mandamus was issued to permit the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority.

The court follows the previous decision and quashes the closure notices and issues a writ of mandamus to permit the petitioners to continue their stone crushing activity till their applications for relocation are disposed of by the competent authority. This decision is in line with the Division Bench's previous ruling, which allowed existing stone crusher units to operate at their present site until their application for relocation is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority.

The court order also quashes certain impugned orders and allows the operation of stone crushing units at their present site for a period of four weeks. However, the order does not impose any costs on the petitioners.

The court's decision is significant as it provides relief to the stone crushing units that were facing closure due to the Karnataka Pollution Control Board's notices. The court's decision to follow the previous ruling of the Division Bench provides consistency and predictability in the application of the law.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision to allow the stone crushing units to continue their operations till their applications for relocation are disposed of by the competent authority ensures that the environmental impact of the units is assessed before any decision is taken on their relocation.

The court's decision is also a reminder to the licensing authority to consider the environmental impact of stone crushing units before granting licenses. The licensing authority must ensure that the units comply with all environmental regulations and that their operations do not have a significant impact on the environment.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision to quash closure notices issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and issue a writ of mandamus to permit the petitioners to continue their stone crushing activity till their applications for relocation are disposed of by the competent authority provides relief to the stone crushing units and ensures that the environmental impact of their operations is assessed before any decision is taken on their relocation. The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.
