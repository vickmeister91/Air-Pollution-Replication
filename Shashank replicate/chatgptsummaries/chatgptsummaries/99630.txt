The issue of unauthorized industrial activity in residential areas of Delhi has been a matter of concern for the court. Despite previous orders, the government has failed to relocate industries and stop new ones from being set up in residential areas. The court has ordered the government to take action against industries operating in non-conforming areas in violation of the Master Plan and Zonal Plan. The court has also noted the government's failure to provide infrastructure and facilities for industries being considered for INSITU regularization.

The court has criticized the government's proposal for INSITU regularization in areas with 70% concentration of industries, stating that it has not considered the relevant infrastructure and the rights of the residents. The court further notes that the government has been shifting its stand on the issue and has failed to perform its functions and obligations under the Delhi Development Act. The court also questions why no action was taken to enforce the Master Plan and stop the functioning of industries in residential/non-conforming areas.

The National Capital Region Planning Board Act, 1985 was enacted to provide for the development of the National Capital Region and to avoid haphazard development. The court notes that there are plots available in the National Capital Region for industries to shift to, but lack of action and initiative by the authorities is the main reason for the industry continuing illegal activity. The court also dismisses the argument that the industries were working with the consent of the government and emphasizes that an illegality cannot become a legality on inaction or connivance of the government authorities.

The court cites various legal principles and cases to support the argument that unauthorized use of residential/non-conforming areas for industrial activity is a violation of the right to life and a breach of duty by the authorities. The court also notes that the proposal for INSITU regularization has been opposed by the National Regional Board as it would defeat the purpose of decongesting Delhi. The court ultimately concludes that the unauthorized use for industrial activity should be immediately closed down or shifted.

The court finds substance in the contentions that all industrial units, except household industry, which have come up in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi after 1st August, 1990 have to stop functioning. The court also criticizes the governmental authorities for not taking action against the blatant breach of legal provisions. The court orders that all industrial units in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi that were established after August 1, 1990, must close down and stop operating within a specific time schedule.

The court directs the Central Government to finalize the list of permissible household industries falling in category 'A' within three months and allot industrial plots to 6,000 industrial units on the waiting list within one year. The order appoints a Monitoring Committee responsible for stopping illegal industrial activity and requires progress reports to be filed regularly. The court also appreciates the assistance of Mr. Ranjit Kumar, who served as Amicus Curiae.

In conclusion, the court has taken a strong stance against unauthorized industrial activity in residential areas of Delhi. The court has ordered the government to take action against industries operating in non-conforming areas in violation of the Master Plan and Zonal Plan. The court has also criticized the government's proposal for INSITU regularization and emphasized the need for infrastructure and facilities for industries being considered for regularization. The court has directed the closure of all industrial units in residential/non-conforming areas in Delhi that were established after August 1, 1990, and the allotment of industrial plots to 6,000 industrial units on the waiting list within one year. The court has appointed a Monitoring Committee responsible for stopping illegal industrial activity and requires progress reports to be filed regularly.
