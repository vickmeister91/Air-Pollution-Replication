Sukhdeo Dangi, the owner of a saw mill in Bihar (Jharkhand), has been granted bail by the court. Dangi was accused of violating various forest and wildlife protection laws, as well as the Bihar (Jharkhand) Cast Chiran Act. He had been in custody since May 4, 2018. The court considered his period of custody and his ownership of the saw mill and directed him to be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each.

The case against Dangi was related to the illegal felling of trees and their transportation to his saw mill. The forest department had seized a large quantity of illegally felled trees from various locations and during the investigation, it was found that these trees were being sent to Dangi's saw mill for sizing. The forest department had also found evidence of Dangi's involvement in the illegal trade of wildlife products.

Dangi was arrested and charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Wildlife Protection Act, and the Bihar (Jharkhand) Cast Chiran Act. He had been in custody for over a year before being granted bail by the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to Dangi was based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the period of custody that Dangi had already served. Secondly, the court took into account Dangi's ownership of the saw mill and the fact that he was not directly involved in the illegal felling of trees. Thirdly, the court noted that Dangi had no previous criminal record and was not a flight risk.

The court directed Dangi to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. This means that Dangi will have to provide a sum of Rs. 30,000 as security for his release on bail. The court also imposed certain conditions on Dangi, such as reporting to the police station regularly and not leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

The decision to grant bail to Dangi has been criticized by some environmental activists and wildlife conservationists. They argue that Dangi's release on bail could lead to further illegal activities in the region. They also point out that the illegal felling of trees and the trade in wildlife products are serious crimes that have a significant impact on the environment and the ecosystem.

However, others have welcomed the court's decision to grant bail to Dangi. They argue that Dangi has been in custody for a long period of time and that his release on bail is a step towards ensuring that justice is served in a timely manner. They also point out that Dangi has not been convicted of any crime and that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sukhdeo Dangi, the owner of a saw mill in Bihar (Jharkhand), who was accused of violating various forest and wildlife protection laws, as well as the Bihar (Jharkhand) Cast Chiran Act. The court considered his period of custody and his ownership of the saw mill and directed him to be released on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The decision to grant bail to Dangi has been criticized by some environmental activists and wildlife conservationists, while others have welcomed it as a step towards ensuring that justice is served in a timely manner.
