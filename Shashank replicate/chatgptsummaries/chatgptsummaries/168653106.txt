The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to Hotel President Inn, which the hotel challenged in court. The court ordered the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable as per the existing Municipal laws, and the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court further directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In another case, a petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws and the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act. The court ordered the petitioner to demolish the excess construction or close it down, and comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. The court also noted that similar cases of violation of municipal laws had been filed and passed separate orders in each case. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, which was permitted subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposed of the case as having been withdrawn.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations. The first case involved pollution control laws, while the second case involved municipal laws and town planning regulations. The court ordered the petitioners to provide detailed information about the extent of construction and any deviations from the sanctioned plan. This information would be used to determine the appropriate course of action, which could include demolition or closure of the excess construction.

The court also noted that similar cases had been filed and passed separate orders in each case. This suggests that the court is taking a consistent approach to cases involving violations of statutory rules and regulations. The court is likely to continue to enforce these rules and regulations in future cases, which could serve as a deterrent to others who might consider violating them.

In the second case, the petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition. The court permitted this, but only after the petitioner deposited a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. This suggests that the court is taking a firm stance on violations of statutory rules and regulations, and is willing to impose financial penalties on those who violate them.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of complying with statutory rules and regulations. The court is taking a consistent approach to cases involving violations of these rules and regulations, and is willing to impose penalties on those who violate them. This is likely to serve as a deterrent to others who might consider violating these rules and regulations in the future.
