The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Shanmuga Das against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had sought to quash a condition imposed by the Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Heggadadevana Kote, which required him to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 8,75,000 for the release of his vehicle bearing No. KL-10-AQ-4977. The petitioner had argued that the imposition of such a condition was not mandatory under the Wild Life Protection Act and that he was a law-abiding citizen.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition and relaxed the condition imposed by the learned Magistrate. The court observed that the imposition of such a condition was not mandatory under the Wild Life Protection Act and that the petitioner had already deposited a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 as security. The court also noted that the petitioner had a valid driving license and that there was no evidence to suggest that he had violated any traffic rules or caused any harm to wildlife.

The court further observed that the imposition of such a condition would cause undue hardship to the petitioner and that it was not necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court, therefore, directed the learned Magistrate to release the vehicle to the petitioner on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 and that he undertakes to produce the vehicle whenever required by the court.

The judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that conditions imposed by the authorities are in line with the provisions of the law and do not cause undue hardship to the citizens. The court has rightly observed that the imposition of such a condition was not mandatory under the Wild Life Protection Act and that the petitioner had already deposited a substantial sum as security. The court has also taken into account the fact that the petitioner was a law-abiding citizen and that there was no evidence to suggest that he had violated any traffic rules or caused any harm to wildlife.

The judgment is also significant as it underscores the need for the authorities to exercise their powers judiciously and not to impose conditions that are not necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the law. The court has rightly observed that the imposition of such a condition would cause undue hardship to the petitioner and that it was not necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act.

In conclusion, the judgment passed by the Karnataka High Court in the writ petition filed by Shanmuga Das against the State of Karnataka is a welcome development as it upholds the rights of citizens and ensures that the authorities exercise their powers judiciously. The court has rightly observed that the imposition of such a condition was not mandatory under the Wild Life Protection Act and that the petitioner had already deposited a substantial sum as security. The court has also taken into account the fact that the petitioner was a law-abiding citizen and that there was no evidence to suggest that he had violated any traffic rules or caused any harm to wildlife.
