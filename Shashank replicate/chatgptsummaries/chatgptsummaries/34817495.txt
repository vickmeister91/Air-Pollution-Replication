The Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks and Blocks Manufacturers Association filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to make it mandatory for the respondents to use fly ash bricks in the construction of 154 residential quarters for NTPL Township at Tuticorin Phase-11. The petitioner argued that the use of fly ash bricks would not only be cost-effective but also environmentally friendly. The respondents, however, argued that the use of fly ash bricks was not mandatory under any law or regulation.

During the hearing, the court noted that the use of fly ash bricks was indeed encouraged by the government and various authorities. The court also noted that the use of fly ash bricks had several benefits, including reducing the carbon footprint of construction projects and promoting the use of industrial waste in a productive manner. However, the court also noted that there was no law or regulation that made the use of fly ash bricks mandatory.

The petitioner then sought permission to withdraw the writ petition with liberty to the members of the petitioner association to file individual writ petitions. The court granted permission and dismissed the writ petition with no costs.

The court's decision highlights the importance of promoting the use of fly ash bricks in construction projects. While the use of fly ash bricks is not mandatory under any law or regulation, it is encouraged by the government and various authorities. The use of fly ash bricks has several benefits, including reducing the carbon footprint of construction projects and promoting the use of industrial waste in a productive manner.

The decision also highlights the importance of individual action in promoting the use of fly ash bricks. While the petitioner association was not successful in its attempt to make the use of fly ash bricks mandatory, individual members of the association can still file writ petitions to promote the use of fly ash bricks in their own construction projects.

Overall, the court's decision is a reminder of the need to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in the construction industry. While the use of fly ash bricks may not be mandatory, it is an important step towards reducing the carbon footprint of construction projects and promoting the use of industrial waste in a productive manner.
