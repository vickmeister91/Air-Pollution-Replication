The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Sarju Makwana against the Women and Child Development department. The petitioner was aggrieved by the termination of her services as an Aanganwadi Worker without any show cause notice or enquiry. The respondents claimed to have issued a show cause notice, but the petitioner was not available at the time of inspection. The court referred to a similar case and noted that the termination order was identical in 84 cases, with only the name of the village changed. The court also referred to a policy issued by the state government for discontinuing an Aanganwadi worker.

The court order states that the employer violated the principles of natural justice and fair play by not following the proper procedure for appointing and removing an Aanganwadi worker. The principles of natural justice are the basic minimum fair procedure that must be followed while exercising decision-making powers. The court cites the case of Uma Nath Pandey v. State of U.P. AIR 2009 SC 2375 to explain natural justice. The court also explains the two rules that have been evolved as representing the principles of natural justice in judicial process, including quasi-judicial and administrative process: 'nemo judex in causa sua' or 'nemo debet esse judex in propria causa sua' and 'audi alteram partem'. The court also mentions the 'useless formality theory' and its application in cases where all facts are not admitted or are not all beyond dispute.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice and the importance of following them in fair adjudication. The court also discusses the disputed nature of the "useless formality theory" and leaves the matter for decision in an appropriate case. The court then applies the principles of natural justice to the case at hand, where 84 Aanganwadi workers were terminated without following the prescribed procedure. The court quashes the order and directs the respondents to reinstate the petitioner and pay backwages and all consequential benefits. The court also orders the respondents to pay a cost of Rs. 2000 and to ensure payment of arrears of salary within 10 days.

The court order is a significant development in the field of employment law, particularly in the context of Aanganwadi workers. The court has emphasized the importance of following the principles of natural justice while exercising decision-making powers, whether in a quasi-judicial or administrative process. The court has also clarified the two rules that have evolved as representing the principles of natural justice, namely 'nemo judex in causa sua' or 'nemo debet esse judex in propria causa sua' and 'audi alteram partem'. These rules ensure that the decision-maker is impartial and that both parties have an opportunity to be heard.

The court has also discussed the disputed nature of the "useless formality theory", which suggests that following a procedure that is not necessary or useful is a mere formality. The court has left the matter for decision in an appropriate case, indicating that the theory may not be applicable in all cases.

In the case at hand, the court has found that the employer violated the principles of natural justice by not following the proper procedure for appointing and removing an Aanganwadi worker. The court has noted that the termination order was identical in 84 cases, indicating that the employer did not follow the prescribed procedure in any of these cases. The court has quashed the order and directed the respondents to reinstate the petitioner and pay backwages and all consequential benefits.
