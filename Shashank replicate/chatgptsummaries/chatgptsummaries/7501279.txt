The case of Bhagwan Singh was brought before the court in a misc. petition against the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, in Criminal Misc. Case No. 69/2012. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91, 451 Cr.P.C. which was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. The petitioner had previously filed an application which was also dismissed, and a revision petition was also dismissed. 

The petitioner then filed a Criminal Misc. Petition No. 5471/2015, which was allowed by the court. The court directed that if any application is filed by the petitioner before the trial Court with complete details of documents and accounts, the same should be considered and decided by the trial Court in accordance with law. 

The petitioner moved an application before the Court below, which was rejected by the impugned order. The Court below rejected the application filed by the petitioner as there was no specific detail of the documents and accounts. The misc. petition was dismissed by the court.

The court's decision to dismiss the misc. petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide specific details of the documents and accounts in question. The court had previously directed the petitioner to provide complete details of the documents and accounts, but the petitioner failed to do so. As a result, the court had no choice but to dismiss the misc. petition.

The court's decision was based on the principle of due process, which requires that all parties to a legal proceeding be given a fair and impartial hearing. In this case, the petitioner failed to provide the necessary details to support his application, and as a result, the court was unable to consider his request.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the misc. petition was based on the petitioner's failure to provide specific details of the documents and accounts in question. The court had previously directed the petitioner to provide complete details of the documents and accounts, but the petitioner failed to do so. As a result, the court had no choice but to dismiss the misc. petition.
