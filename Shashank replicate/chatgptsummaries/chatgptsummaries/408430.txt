In the case of Sri Satyabrata Majhi vs State Of Orissa, the petitioner had filed a petition to quash the proceeding of 2(b) C.C. No. 1 of 1999 of the Court of JMFC (Paradeep), Kujanga and the order (Annexure-5) passed in the said proceeding on 11.2.1999 refusing to release the trawler of the petitioner seized in the aforesaid case for an offence Under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner had argued that the trawler was not involved in any illegal activity and that it was being used for fishing purposes. However, the court found that the case did not come under any of the categories enumerated by the apex Court in Ch. Bhajan Lal case (supra) warranting interference by the High Court in exercise of its inherent power Under Section 482, Cr.P.C.

The court also found that the seized trawler cannot be released in favour of the petitioner, as the same became the State's property as soon as the same is seized. The court order states that the power to release a seized vehicle has been removed to prevent it from being returned to the accused. Therefore, the court found no fault with the decision to refuse to release the vessel/trawler to the petitioner.

In addition, the court dismissed the Criminal Misc. Case and questioned its maintainability. The objection raised lost its force due to a petition filed by the petitioner to convert it into a Criminal Revision. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any specific allegations against any of the respondents and that the petition was filed only to seek the release of the trawler. Therefore, the court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it.

Overall, the court order in Sri Satyabrata Majhi vs State Of Orissa upheld the decision to refuse to release the seized trawler to the petitioner. The court found that the trawler had become the State's property as soon as it was seized and that the power to release a seized vehicle had been removed to prevent it from being returned to the accused. The court also dismissed the Criminal Misc. Case and questioned its maintainability, as the petitioner had not made any specific allegations against any of the respondents and the petition was filed only to seek the release of the trawler.
