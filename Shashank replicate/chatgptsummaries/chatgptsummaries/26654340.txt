The court order pertains to a dispute between workmen and the management of M/s Birla Textile Mills, a hazardous industry that was relocated from Delhi to Baddi in Himachal Pradesh. The workmen filed two petitions seeking to quash an award passed by the Industrial Tribunal-cum-Labour Court and to extend the same benefits to the petitioners as have been extended to other similarly situated workmen. The court refers to directions issued by the Apex Court in 1996 and 1997 pertaining to the rights and benefits of the workmen, including continuity of employment, payment of full wages with continuity of service during the period between closure and restart of the industry, and payment of shifting bonus and compensation.

The court ruled that the period between the closure and restart of the mill should be treated as active employment, and workmen should be paid full wages with continuity in service. The workmen were to be treated as if they were in service in Delhi until the industry was restarted at the relocated place. The court also ordered the management to pay compensation to the workmen and clarified the wages payable to them. 

The workmen filed several petitions and demands, which were adjudicated by the Labour Court and challenged by the Union before the Apex Court. The Union's petition was dismissed, and the workmen filed individual petitions, which were allowed by the learned Single Judge of the Court. The decision was challenged in a bunch of LPAs filed on behalf of the management, and the Division Bench of the Court passed orders leaving the questions of law open. The court also clarified the factual dispute regarding the variable Dearness Allowance.

The court order requires the appellant(s) to file a statement showing the increase in variable Dearness Allowance in Delhi between 1996 to March 1999 and whether it was paid to workers who were relocated in March 1999 in H.P. The court also discusses the normal rule that all identically situated persons should be treated alike when given relief by the court, but there are exceptions such as laches, delays, and acquiescence. The court cites a Supreme Court case to explain that if a judgment is in personam, those who intend to get the benefit of the judgment must satisfy the court that their petition does not suffer from laches, delays, or acquiescence.

The court order discusses various cases and their implications. It mentions that judgments should not be read as statutes and that the context of each case is important. The order also discusses a case where the benefit of a judgment was extended to the appellants, but notes that they had approached the court in a timely manner. The order concludes by stating that the respondents in the current case had not approached the court earlier and that their petition should be dismissed on the grounds of laches, delays, and acquiescence.

The court emphasized that an important factor in exercise of discretionary relief under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is laches and delay. The court dismissed a writ petition for delay in approaching the court and refused to extend the benefit of judgment passed in respect of other similarly situated employees. The court also cited other cases where delay and laches were considered in denying relief to individuals.

The court order discusses the principle of laches, which considers acquiescence on the claimant's part and any change of position that has occurred on the defendant's part in determining whether there has been a delay that amounts to laches. The order also states that the normal rule is that all similarly situated persons should be treated alike in service matters, but there are exceptions in the form of laches and delays as well as acquiescence. The order further explains that if the judgment of the court was in personam, those who want to get the benefit of the said judgment extended to them shall have to satisfy that their petition does not suffer from either laches and delays or acquiescence. 

The court found no merit in the writ petitions seeking extension of benefits from a previous judgment and dismissed them, leaving the parties to bear their own costs. The petitioners were unable to prove that the previous judgment was intended to benefit all similarly situated persons and did not even attempt to do so. The court stated that a petition seeking extension of benefits from a previous judgment would normally be dismissed due to delays, unless it can be proven that the previous judgment was intended to benefit all similarly situated persons.
