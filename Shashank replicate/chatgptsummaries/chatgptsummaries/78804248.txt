The court order pertains to a case where the appellant filed a petition seeking to quash an order and notification related to the ownership of a plantation. The court held that the matter should be pursued before the Tribunal constituted under the Kerala Forest (Vesting and Management of Ecologically Fragile Lands) Act, 2003. The order also provides a detailed background of the case, including the implementation of Act 26 of 1971 and subsequent legal proceedings.

The court order states that the appellant's plantation was illegally treated as a private forest vested in the state under Act 26 of 1971. However, in Ext.P4 order, the Forest Tribunal recorded a finding that 530 acres of land were exempted from vesting under section 3 of Act 26 of 1971. This order was upheld by the court and the Apex Court. Later, 462.10 acres were again notified as ecologically fragile land vested in the state under Section 3(1) of Act 21 of 2005. The appellant filed an application for revision of the notification, but it was rejected. The issue raised before the court was whether the case of the appellant is covered in his favor by the Division Bench Judgment in Kumari Varma's case or whether it is covered against him by the judgment of the Division Bench in W.P.(C) No.18134 of 2006 and connected cases.

The court order states that all ecologically fragile lands held by any person or with any other form of right over them will be transferred to and vested in the government, free from all encumbrances. The ownership and possession of the land will stand extinguished from the date of commencement of the Act. The order also defines ecologically fragile lands as forest land or any land declared as such by the government. The court examines the circumstances under which forest land can be held by a person and concludes that it must be a person other than the state. The Kerala Forest Act is also examined to understand the scheme of the Act. The order also mentions that private rights can be created by the state even after a reserved forest is notified.

The court order discusses the classification of forest land in the state of Kerala, India. It explains that land can be classified as reserved forest, protected forest, or private forest, and that the definition of "private forest" is broad enough to include land used for cultivation. The order also discusses the definition of "ecologically fragile land" and how it relates to forest land. Ultimately, the court determines that the lands in dispute are not ecologically fragile land, despite being covered with naturally grown trees and undergrowth, because they do not fall under the definition of reserved or protected forest and are excluded from the definition of private forest.

The court order discusses the definition of "forest" and "ecologically fragile land" under the Ecologically Fragile Lands Act. The court cites previous cases to determine that plantation land can be considered a forest if the owner intends to abandon it and allow it to become a forest. The court also considers whether lands used for long-term crop cultivation, such as tea or cardamom, should be considered ecologically fragile lands. The order notes that if a piece of land is considered ecologically fragile, it will be transferred to the government and the owner's rights will be extinguished, with compensation only available for certain types of land. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and safeguarding forests and wildlife.

The court order states that protecting and improving the environment, safeguarding forests and wildlife is a fundamental duty of every citizen of India. The purpose of the Ecologically Fragile Lands Act is to protect the environment, and an interpretation that promotes this purpose should be preferred. The court rejected the state's submission that the land in question was abandoned and stated that the state cannot take advantage of a wrong committed by it in depriving the respondent of legal rights. The court also clarified that a judgment rendered by a Division Bench of the court is binding on other Division Benches, and an appeal pending or a stay order does not affect the binding nature of the judgment. The court referred to a previous judgment in a similar case and stated that the principles laid down in that case should apply to the present case. The court rejected the argument that an appeal filed by the state against the judgment of the Division Bench is pending before the Apex Court and that the judgment should not be treated as a binding precedent. The court also considered the constitutional validity of Act 21 of 2005 and concluded that a legislature cannot directly overrule a judgment of the court but can enact legislation in a manner to make a judgment ineffective by altering the very basis of the judgment. The court answered the question of whether Section 3(1) of Act 21 of 2005 overrides the judgment given by Forest Tribunal, High Court, and Supreme Court in the context of Act 26 of 1971.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 3(1) of the 2003 Act in relation to the vesting of ownership and possession of private forests and ecologically fragile lands in the state. The court concludes that the non obstante clause in Section 3(1) gives overriding effect to the 2003 Act despite any previous judgments or orders of the Forest Tribunal, High Court, or Supreme Court. The court also determines that judgments rendered under the 1971 Act are relevant under Section 42 of the
