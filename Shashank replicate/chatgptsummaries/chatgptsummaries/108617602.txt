The Bombay High Court heard multiple writ petitions and a public interest litigation related to the construction of a sugar factory in Maharashtra. The petitions challenged the grant of licenses and certificates to the factory and sought to stop its construction due to concerns about waste disposal and environmental impact. The court heard all the petitions together and issued a judgment on March 16, 2018.

The court order lists the parties involved in two writ petitions, WP.135 of 2013 and WRIT PETITION NO. 4542 OF 2013. The petitioners are Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd., Siddeshwar Navnad Wagaz, Shivaji Nanadev Surve, Amol Sakshan Chavan, and Balaji Mangal Patil. The respondents include the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and various other government officials and organizations. No details about the content of the petitions or the court's ruling are provided.

The court also heard a writ petition filed by Grampanchayat Aashti against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Collector of Solapur, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, the Deputy Regional Officer of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Tahsildar of Mohol, and the Zilla Parishad of Solapur. The court heard two other writ petitions filed by Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd. against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., and the Union of India.

The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, as long as they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji ultimately receiving one and beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and others, leading to a court order restraining Audumbarraoji from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained. The Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice for objections, and nine were received, mostly from the petitioners in the present writ petitions/PIL.

The court order discusses a case involving the setting up of a new sugar factory within 15km of existing sugar factories. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the proposed factory was more than 15km away from existing factories, but some individuals filed writ petitions challenging this certification. The court then considers the amended provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which outline the requirements for setting up a new sugar factory and the minimum distance required from existing factories.

The court order specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court will consider the objections of Lokshakti, who challenged the grant of aerial distance certificate to Audumbarraoji. The court will also consider the decision of the Division Bench of the court at Aurangabad in Gangamai Industries & Construction Limited vs. State of Maharashtra and Others.

The court order discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court refers to a previous case, Gangamai, which established that the Survey of India has the power to determine the minimum distance between sugar factories, and the Commissioner of Sugar cannot make a decision contrary to this. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was made earlier than Lokshakti's, and therefore the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting it to Audumbarraoji and refusing it to Lokshakti. The court also addresses objections raised by Lokshakti regarding the authenticity of Audumbarraoji's application and the timing of the applications.

The court order pertains to a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other. The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their factories at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The petitioner argued that the IEM granted to one factory had become inoperative due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966. The court heard arguments from both sides and made a decision.

The court order discusses a case involving the distance between sugar factories and the minimum distance prescribed by the government. The court considers arguments from both sides and ultimately concludes that a change in location for a sugar factory is permissible and should relate back to the date of the initial application.
