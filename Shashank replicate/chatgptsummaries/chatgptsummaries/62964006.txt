In a recent court case, a petitioner filed a Criminal Original Petition to set aside a summon issued by the first respondent. The petitioner's argument was that a person can only be summoned if a crime has been registered against them, and that the summon did not mention the details of documents to be produced by the petitioner. The learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner presented this argument before the court.

On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the first respondent submitted that the first respondent may be given liberty to issue fresh summons, mentioning the details of documents to be produced by the petitioner. The court heard both sides and considered the arguments presented before it.

After considering the arguments, the court allowed the petition and set aside the summon. The court also gave the first respondent the liberty to issue a fresh summon with the details of documents to be produced by the petitioner. This decision was made in order to ensure that the summon was issued in accordance with the law and that the petitioner's rights were protected.

The court's decision was based on the fact that a person can only be summoned if a crime has been registered against them. In this case, the summon did not mention the details of documents to be produced by the petitioner, which was a violation of the petitioner's rights. Therefore, the court set aside the summon and gave the first respondent the liberty to issue a fresh summon with the necessary details.

This case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that the rights of all parties involved are protected. The court's decision in this case was a fair and just one, as it ensured that the summon was issued in accordance with the law and that the petitioner's rights were protected. It is important for all parties involved in legal proceedings to be aware of their rights and to ensure that they are protected throughout the process.
