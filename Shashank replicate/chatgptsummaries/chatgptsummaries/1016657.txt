The Madras High Court recently issued two court orders pertaining to the preservation of the ecological balance in the hill station of Nilgiris District. The first court order was in response to two writ petitions filed by Elephant G. Rajendran, seeking the demolition of all illegal and unauthorized constructions in four Taluks of Nilgiris District. The petitioner sought interim directions for filing a detailed report on the number of buildings constructed in violation of planning rules and disconnecting power, water, and sewerage connections.

The court issued interim directions to restrain the granting of electricity/water service connections to any building or farm house constructed without a sanctioned plan. The court directed the authorities to enforce the regulatory measures contained in Chapter X-A of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act and Rules to maintain ecological balance in the hill station of Nilgiris District. The court referred to the importance of upholding environmental laws and preventing the State and citizens from upsetting them.

The second court order emphasizes the importance of preserving the ecological balance and pristine purity of hill stations. The court finds that the impugned G.O. is illegal and invalid as it is arbitrary and based on irrelevant matters. The court refers to the significance of Articles 21, 47, and 51-A(g) of the Constitution, which mandate the state to protect and improve the environment.

The court directs the respondents to take necessary steps to enforce the provisions contained in Chapter X-A of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act and eliminate all unauthorized constructions made in violation of the rules. The respondents are given three months to carry out the exercise and file a compliance report in the Registry.

The Nilgiris District is a popular tourist destination and is known for its natural beauty. However, the rampant construction of unauthorized buildings and farmhouses has led to the degradation of the environment.
