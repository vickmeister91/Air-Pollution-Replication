The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case in which M/S Jindal Pipes Ltd. challenged an order by the Cess Appellate Committee, which dismissed the petitioner's appeals against an order of assessment of Cess. The petitioner argued that as an engineering industry, it was not covered under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 and Rules, 1978 made thereunder for assessment of Cess. However, the court examined the relevant laws and schedules and found that the petitioner's industry was covered under Schedule I of the Cess Act for assessment of Cess. 

The court also found that the appeal was filed after the maximum period allowed under the Cess Rules, 1978, and therefore dismissed the appeal. The court order states that the period of limitation for filing an application or appeal cannot be extended beyond the maximum period provided under the relevant Act and/or Rules. In the present case, the appeal was filed after six and a half months, which is beyond the statutory period of 30-45 days. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition and the normal rule to condone the delay for adjudication of the appeal on merit shall not apply in the matter. The order was dated November 20, 2013.
