The inspection will help identify any violations and ensure that corrective action is taken.

In addition to this, a meeting of stakeholders was also ordered to find solutions for dealing with the discharge of effluents. This is an important step towards finding sustainable solutions for managing industrial waste and ensuring that it does not harm the environment. The stakeholders will be able to share their perspectives and come up with solutions that are practical and effective.

This is an important step towards ensuring that the case is properly documented and that all parties are aware of their responsibilities. The case was listed for compliance on December 4th, which means that the parties involved will have to comply with the court's orders by this date.
