Two court orders have been summarized, both of which pertain to traffic violation cases. The first case involves an accused who was caught driving a vehicle at a speed exceeding the prescribed limit. The prosecution presented three witnesses who testified to the offense, and the accused chose to contest the charges. During the trial, the accused admitted to driving the vehicle but claimed that he was on a test drive and that the vehicle was not fit for commercial use. The defense argued that the speed governor was fitted by the company and that the interceptor who measured the speed was not trained. However, the court found the accused guilty of violating the permit condition and driving beyond the prescribed speed limit.

In the second case, the accused was caught driving a vehicle beyond the prescribed speed limit, which is a violation of Hon'ble Supreme Court directions and punishable under Section 66.1/192A of the Motor Vehicles Act. The defense counsel argued that the speed measuring device was wrong and the interceptor was not trained, but the court found no evidence to support these claims. The court also rejected the defense's argument that no passenger was sitting in the vehicle at the time of the challan, stating that it is the driver's duty to drive safely regardless of whether passengers are present. The court found the accused guilty of overspeeding and convicted him under Section 112/183(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act.

In both cases, the accused were caught violating the prescribed speed limit. The defense in both cases tried to argue that the speed measuring device was not accurate and that the interceptor was not trained. However, the court found no evidence to support these claims and convicted the accused of overspeeding. In the first case, the accused claimed that he was on a test drive and that the vehicle was not fit for commercial use. However, the court found him guilty of violating the permit condition and driving beyond the prescribed speed limit. In the second case, the defense argued that no passenger was present in the vehicle at the time of the challan. However, the court rejected this argument and convicted the accused of overspeeding.

It is important to note that overspeeding is a serious offense and can lead to accidents and fatalities. The prescribed speed limit is set for a reason, and it is the driver's responsibility to adhere to it. The court's decision to convict the accused in both cases sends a strong message that overspeeding will not be tolerated and that drivers must take responsibility for their actions on the road.

In conclusion, the court orders summarized above both pertain to traffic violation cases where the accused were caught driving at a speed exceeding the prescribed limit. The defense in both cases tried to argue that the speed measuring device was not accurate and that the interceptor was not trained. However, the court found no evidence to support these claims and convicted the accused of overspeeding. It is important for drivers to adhere to the prescribed speed limit to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road.
