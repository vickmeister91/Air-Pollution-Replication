The court recently granted bail to Vishnu Chandrawanshi, who was accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution's case was based on a co-accused's memorandum, which alleged that Chandrawanshi had received certain organs of a tiger for use in rituals. However, the court found that there was no evidence against Chandrawanshi other than the memorandum and that he had been in judicial custody since December 6, 2016. The court granted bail on the condition that Chandrawanshi furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a surety in the same amount.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, or capturing of wild animals, and also prohibits the trade in wildlife and wildlife products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the prosecution's case was based on a co-accused's memorandum, which alleged that Chandrawanshi had received certain organs of a tiger for use in rituals. However, the court found that there was no evidence against Chandrawanshi other than the memorandum. The court also noted that Chandrawanshi had been in judicial custody since December 6, 2016, which was a significant period of time. The court, therefore, granted bail to Chandrawanshi.

The court granted bail on the condition that Chandrawanshi furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a surety in the same amount. A personal bond is a written promise by the accused to appear in court when required. A surety is a person who agrees to pay a certain amount of money if the accused fails to appear in court. The court imposed these conditions to ensure that Chandrawanshi appears in court when required.

The court's decision to grant bail to Chandrawanshi is significant because it highlights the importance of evidence in criminal cases. The court found that there was no evidence against Chandrawanshi other than the memorandum, which was not sufficient to prove his guilt. The court also noted that Chandrawanshi had been in judicial custody for a significant period of time, which suggests that he had already suffered enough. The court, therefore, decided to grant him bail.
