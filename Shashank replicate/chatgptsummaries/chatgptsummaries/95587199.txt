The case at hand involves a complaint filed by G.V. Shantharaj against M/S Reliaable Lakeshore for an offence punishable under section 138 of the N.I. Act. Section 138 of the N.I. Act deals with the dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The petitioner had alleged that the respondents had issued a cheque that was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in their account. The petitioner had sought to lead secondary evidence to prove his case.

The petitioner had filed an application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act seeking permission to lead secondary evidence. Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act deals with the admissibility of secondary evidence. It provides that secondary evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or contents of a document when the original is not available or cannot be produced in court. The court, however, rejected the petitioner's application.

The court found that the issuance of a cheque by the respondents-accused was not in dispute. The respondents had not denied issuing the cheque. The only issue in dispute was whether the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in their account. The court held that since the issuance of the cheque was not in dispute, allowing the petitioner to lead secondary evidence did not arise.

The court's decision to reject the petitioner's application under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act was based on the principle of law that secondary evidence can only be admitted when the original document is not available or cannot be produced in court. In this case, the original cheque was available and had been produced in court. Therefore, the court held that there was no need to admit secondary evidence.

The court's decision to dismiss the criminal petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to prove his case. The court found that the petitioner had not been able to establish that the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account of the respondents. The court held that the petitioner had failed to discharge the burden of proof that was on him.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by G.V. Shantharaj against M/S Reliaable Lakeshore. The petitioner had filed a complaint against the respondents for an offence punishable under section 138 of the N.I. Act. The petitioner had sought to lead secondary evidence to prove his case, which was rejected by the court. The court found that the issuance of a cheque by the respondents-accused was not in dispute, and therefore, allowing the petitioner to lead secondary evidence did not arise. The court dismissed the criminal petition as the petitioner had failed to prove his case.
