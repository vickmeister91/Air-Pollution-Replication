The issue of sand quarrying in Tamil Nadu has been a subject of concern for environmentalists and local residents for some time. In one case, an agriculturist filed a writ petition as a Public Interest Litigation against several government departments and officials for allowing sand quarrying in Oruvanthur Village, Namakkal District, Tamil Nadu. The petitioner claimed that the quarrying operations violated environmental protection and conservation, resulted in severe water shortage, and affected flora and fauna. The court directed the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee to inspect the quarry and report on compliance with environmental clearance conditions. The second respondent filed a counter affidavit stating that the sand quarry operation was in accordance with the rules and regulations and that all conditions imposed by SEIAA were strictly complied with. The court has yet to make a decision on the matter.

In another case, the court order discusses a case regarding sand quarrying in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner argues that the government's quarrying operations are illegal and damaging to the environment, while the respondents argue that they have followed proper procedures and obtained environmental clearance. A technical team inspected the quarry and made recommendations for compliance with environmental regulations. The court ultimately decides not to direct the petitioner to invoke an alternative remedy and notes that the National Green Tribunal is not functioning due to a lack of members.

The court order also discusses the compliance report submitted by the Assistant Director (Mines) regarding sand quarry operations in Tamil Nadu. The court notes the importance of balancing economic development with environmental concerns, particularly in a water-starved state like Tamil Nadu. The court cites previous Supreme Court decisions and recommendations for sustainable mining practices and the need for strict compliance with environmental laws. The court also highlights the need for effective mechanisms to prevent encroachments and illegal constructions on water bodies. The court suggests appointing a committee of experts to monitor sand quarry operations and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.

Finally, the court order pertains to a challenge against the implementation of the New Veeranam Extension Project in Tamil Nadu, which involves extracting sub-surface water from the Kollidam river bed to provide drinking water to the people of Chennai. The court has upheld the project, but has also noted infractions in sand quarry operations carried out by the state government and has constituted a monitoring committee to oversee the operations and submit periodic reports. The court has also emphasized the need for a balance between environmental concerns and economic development.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of balancing economic development with environmental concerns in Tamil Nadu. While sand quarrying and other mining operations can provide economic benefits, they must be carried out in compliance with environmental laws and regulations to prevent damage to the environment and local communities. The court has suggested appointing committees of experts to monitor these operations and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Additionally, the court has emphasized the need for effective mechanisms to prevent encroachments and illegal constructions on water bodies, which are critical for the survival of local ecosystems and communities.
