The first court order pertains to a civil suit for damages filed against the Gujarat Electricity Board (now Dakshin Gujarat Vij Co. Ltd.) by a plaintiff who suffered injuries due to an accident caused by a lack of insulation in a high tension line (HTL). The appellant argued that the owner and contractor of the premises where the incident occurred were also responsible and that the liability could not be solely on the Electricity Board. However, the respondent argued that the Board had the primary responsibility to maintain the HTL and could not escape liability for an accident caused by the lack of insulation.

The court referred to the Indian Electricity Rules, which impose an obligation on the part of the Electricity Board to maintain the HTL and take necessary precautions. The court also noted that the burden of proof in cases of negligence lies with the plaintiff, who must prove that the defendant breached a duty of care owed to them, and that the breach caused the injury. However, in cases where the defendant is engaged in a hazardous or risky activity, the principle of strict liability applies, and the defendant is liable for any harm caused, regardless of fault or negligence.

The court found that the Electricity Board was negligent in not noticing that the HTL was too close to the building and failed to take necessary precautions. The court rejected the appellant's argument of non-joinder and mis-joinder of parties and held that the maintenance of the line was the exclusive responsibility of the Electricity Board. The court ultimately upheld the judgment and order in part, allowing the suit for damages.

The second court order also involves the Gujarat Electricity Board and pertains to a case where a plaintiff came in contact with a live wire. The appellant argued that the contractor should be held liable, but the court found that the maintenance of the line was the exclusive responsibility of the Electricity Board. The court referred to the Indian Electricity Act and Rules, which provide for the obligation on the part of the Electricity Board to maintain the line and take necessary precautions. The court also referred to the strict liability rule and found that the Electricity Board could not avoid liability.

The court rejected the appellant's argument of non-joinder and mis-joinder of parties and held that the Electricity Board was negligent in not noticing that the HTL was too close to the building and failed to take necessary precautions. The court found that the appellant was liable for the injuries caused to the plaintiff and upheld the lower court's order awarding compensation.

The third court order discusses the concept of strict liability in cases involving hazardous or risky activities that may cause harm to others. The liability is not based on negligence or fault, but on the foreseeable risk inherent in the activity. The principle of strict liability has its origin in English Common Law and has been approved and followed in many subsequent decisions in England and India.

The court also discusses the quantum of compensation in cases where injury has been caused due to hazardous activities. The court concludes that the award made by the lower court is just and proper and dismisses the appeal.

In summary, the court orders discussed above pertain to cases involving the Gujarat Electricity Board and the liability of the Board for injuries caused due to a lack of insulation in high tension lines. The court referred to the Indian Electricity Act and Rules, which impose an obligation on the part of the Electricity Board to maintain the lines and take necessary precautions. The court also applied the principle of strict liability in cases involving hazardous or risky activities that may cause harm to others. The court upheld the lower court's order awarding compensation and dismissed the appeals.
