The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently granted bail to Satish Pathariya and four others who were arrested for hunting wild boar in a forest in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants had filed for bail, claiming innocence and no prior criminal record. The court allowed the bail application, subject to certain conditions.

The court directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one surety each in the same amount. The surety should be a close relative of the applicant and should be a permanent resident of the area where the applicant resides. The surety should also furnish an affidavit stating that they have sufficient means to pay the amount of the bond in case the applicant fails to comply with the conditions of the bail.

The court also directed the applicants to cooperate in the trial and not to commit similar offenses. The applicants were warned that if they violate any of the conditions of the bail, their bail would be cancelled, and they would be taken into custody.

The court considered various factors while granting bail to the applicants. The court noted that the applicants had no prior criminal record and that they were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court also considered the fact that the applicants had been in custody for a considerable period and that the trial was likely to take some time.

The court observed that the offense committed by the applicants was serious and that it had a detrimental effect on the environment. The court noted that the Wild Life Protection Act was enacted to protect the wildlife and their habitats and that any violation of the Act would have serious consequences.

The court, therefore, directed the applicants to strictly comply with the conditions of the bail and to cooperate in the trial. The court also warned the applicants that any violation of the conditions of the bail would result in the cancellation of their bail and their immediate arrest.
