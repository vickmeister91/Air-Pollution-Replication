The Supreme Court of India has issued an order directing the State to identify forest lands based on government records as of October 25, 1980, and submit a report within three weeks. The Chief Secretary has been directed to supervise the preparation of the report and not delegate it to anyone else. The stay on contempt proceedings will continue until further orders.

The order comes in response to a petition filed by the Wildlife Trust of India, which sought the implementation of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The Act recognizes the rights of forest-dwelling communities to their traditional lands and resources, and provides for their resettlement and rehabilitation in case of displacement.

The petition argued that the State had failed to implement the Act, resulting in the displacement of thousands of forest-dwelling communities and the destruction of their livelihoods. It also alleged that the State had illegally diverted forest lands for non-forest purposes, in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The Supreme Court had earlier issued a stay on contempt proceedings against the State, pending the submission of a report on the identification of forest lands. The latest order extends the stay until further orders, indicating that the Court is satisfied with the progress made by the State in complying with its directions.

The order is significant in light of the ongoing debate over the implementation of the Forest Rights Act and the protection of forest lands in India. The Act has been criticized by some as a threat to conservation efforts, while others argue that it is necessary to protect the rights of forest-dwelling communities and ensure their participation in conservation efforts.

The Supreme Court's order is likely to have far-reaching implications for the implementation of the Act and the protection of forest lands in India. It remains to be seen how the State will respond to the Court's directions and whether it will take steps to ensure the rights of forest-dwelling communities are protected.
