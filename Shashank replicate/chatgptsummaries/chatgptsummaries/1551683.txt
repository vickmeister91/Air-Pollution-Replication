The Kerala High Court recently addressed the issue of whether police officials were justified in prosecuting stage carriage operators for using air horns. The petitioners argued that air horns were an integral part of the air brake system and therefore their use in vehicles could not be prohibited. However, the court found that while there was no specific prohibition against air horns, any sound producing device that generated an unduly harsh, shrill, loud or alarming noise could not be used in a vehicle. The court also noted that the law making authority had framed rules to maintain ambient air quality standards in respect of noise on the roads and public places.

The court order specifies the maximum permissible noise levels for different categories of vehicles and emphasizes the responsibility of authorities to enforce noise pollution control measures. The use of air horns in transport vehicles is prohibited, and the State Government is directed to take necessary action to implement the mandates contained in the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. The Police and Transport authorities are instructed to ensure strict compliance with the ban on air horns and take appropriate action to abate noise pollution.

The court also rejects the petitioners' contention that their constitutional rights have been violated. The court found that the right to carry on a trade or business is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public. The court noted that the use of air horns in transport vehicles was not an essential part of the business of stage carriage operators and that the ban on air horns was a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public.

The court order also highlights the importance of maintaining ambient air quality standards in respect of noise on the roads and public places. The court notes that the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, have been framed to maintain ambient air quality standards in respect of noise on the roads and public places. The court emphasizes the responsibility of authorities to enforce noise pollution control measures and to take appropriate action to abate noise pollution.

The court order specifies the maximum permissible noise levels for different categories of vehicles. The maximum permissible noise level for transport vehicles is 80 decibels. The court notes that the use of air horns in transport vehicles is prohibited and that the State Government is directed to take necessary action to implement the mandates contained in the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.

The court order also emphasizes the responsibility of the Police and Transport authorities to ensure strict compliance with the ban on air horns and to take appropriate action to abate noise pollution. The court notes that the Police and Transport authorities have a duty to enforce the law and to take appropriate action against violators of the ban on air horns.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court has addressed the issue of whether police officials were justified in prosecuting stage carriage operators for using air horns.
