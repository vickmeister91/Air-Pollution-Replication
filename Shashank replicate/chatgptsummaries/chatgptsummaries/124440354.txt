The Bombay High Court recently heard a case between the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay regarding the slaughtering of sheep and goats. The association sought to quash a letter from the respondents and obtain licenses for its members to slaughter animals in their respective premises. The court heard arguments from both sides and separated the case from a related public interest litigation. The petitioners are an association of butchers and meat vendors, and the respondents include the municipal corporation and a public charitable trust. The case involves the history of animal slaughter in Mumbai and the construction of a new abattoir in Deonar.

The court order discusses a petition filed in 1968 regarding the construction of an abattoir near Deonar. The Bandra slaughterhouse was demolished in 1973, and all animal slaughter operations were shifted to the Deonar abattoir. The petitioners found it difficult to get proper service at Deonar and persuaded the municipal authorities to consider their case for permitting slaughterhouses outside the Deonar abattoir. In 1991, the municipal authorities granted individual licenses to slaughter sheep and goats with various conditions. About 360 individual licenses were issued, but there were problems regarding waste and waste disposal. On July 20, 1991, the Respondents issued a communication stating that the permission granted on an experimental basis was for a period of three months only.

The court order pertains to the revocation of licenses granted to suburban licensees to remove sheep and goats from Deonar Abattoir to their respective shops. The permission was granted for three months only up to 3rd August 1991, and it was experimental. The court was reviewing a challenge to the withdrawal of the letter of 20th July 1991. The court referred to previous orders and statutory provisions, including the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888, which mandates that slaughter of animals will take place only in a slaughter-house established by the Municipal Corporation or a licensed slaughter-house.

The court order discusses various sections of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act related to markets and slaughterhouses. It states that all markets and slaughterhouses maintained by the Corporation shall be called "municipal markets" or "municipal slaughterhouses," while all others shall be deemed private. The Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation can close any municipal market or slaughterhouse with the sanction of the Corporation and the State Government. Section 401 requires a license from the Commissioner to sell or expose for sale any animal, and an amendment adds elegant or exotic birds and fish to the list. Section 403 prohibits keeping private markets or using any place as a slaughterhouse without a license. The Commissioner may suspend licenses for failure to comply with regulations or for not keeping premises clean. Any animal or fish found in violation may be seized and sold, with proceeds belonging to the Corporation.

The court order discusses various sections of the law related to the slaughter and sale of animals for human consumption. Section 410 prohibits the sale or supply of animals, meat, or fish intended for human consumption in any place other than a municipal or private market without a license. The Bombay Suburban Khatik Association has filed a writ petition claiming that the Municipal Corporation is unlawfully prohibiting their lawful trade. The court expects a comprehensive affidavit from the Municipal Corporation detailing their compliance with the relevant statutes and provisions. The affidavit is to be filed by November 2, 2018.

The court order requires a veterinary complex comprising a slaughterhouse, veterinary hospital, dog control center, cattle pound, and animal incinerator to be constructed and established in Navi Mumbai. The Municipal Commissioner or a high-ranking officer authorized by him must provide an affidavit indicating the steps taken to move the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra (CIDCO) to hand over the plot of land identified for the slaughterhouse. The affidavit should also indicate when the plot will be handed over, when administrative and budgetary approvals and sanctions will be granted, when construction will commence, and when it will be completed. The court also notes that the State Government and statutory functionaries have neglected the issue of maintenance and up-keep of slaughterhouses, licensing of private slaughterhouses, prohibition of illegal slaughter, and display and sale of animal beef. The court expects the State to ensure that rules framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 are not violated. The court also discourages multiple PILs on the same question and expects petitioners to be aware of pending Supreme Court proceedings on the same issue.

The court order discusses a case involving the Bombay Suburban Khatik Association and the MCGM. The court notes that there is nothing pending in the Supreme Court or in this court regarding the case. The court expects the State Government to guide and control all Municipal Corporations and Panchayats in the state to prevent pollution and ensure public health. The court also analyzes several affidavits filed on record, including one from the General Manager of Deonar abattoir denying the Petitioners' right to any license or permission to slaughter goats or sheep attached to their respective shops. Another affidavit references the 2001 Slaughter House Rules and states that the Deonar abattoir is the only recognized slaughterhouse within the MCGM jurisdiction.

The court order references various legal statutes and previous court cases related to the operation of slaughterhouses in Mumbai
