The Kerala High Court recently issued two court orders pertaining to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) in the state. The first order was in response to a bunch of writ petitions filed by residents of small islands in Ernakulam district, Kerala, who are included under CRZ III category, which prohibits any construction/reconstruction/renovation of dwelling units or other structures within 200 meters from the High Tide Line. The petitioners sought a modification in the Coastal Zone Management Plan of Kerala to allow them to construct buildings in their respective properties.

The court examined the clauses in CRZ III and IV and noted that relaxation is possible in the distance rule in the case of small islands in appropriate cases. The court directed the competent authority to apply its mind to the ground realities and redress the grievances of the inhabitants. The court also noted that some local statutory authorities have been flouting the regulations under the CRZ.

The second court order discusses the issue of occupancy certificates being issued in violation of regulations under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The Ministry of Environmental Forests, Union of India has stated that the State Government is empowered to formulate the Coastal Zone Management Plan and modify it if necessary. The court has directed the Department of Science, Technology and Environment under the Govt. of Kerala to take immediate steps to move the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority and request the said authority to take a decision for modification or amendment of Coastal Zone Management Plan appropriately in the light of the observations made above. The authority concerned shall afford sufficient opportunity to the representative groups of these islanders as well as the local statutory bodies before any decision is taken in the matter.

The court's orders are significant as they address the concerns of the residents of small islands who have been facing difficulties in constructing buildings in their respective properties due to the restrictions under CRZ III. The court has recognized that relaxation is possible in the distance rule in the case of small islands in appropriate cases and has directed the competent authority to apply its mind to the ground realities and redress the grievances of the inhabitants.

The court has also noted that some local statutory authorities have been flouting the regulations under the CRZ. This is a serious concern as it undermines the purpose of the regulations and puts the environment at risk. The court's order sends a strong message to these authorities that they must comply with the regulations and take necessary steps to protect the environment.

The court's order regarding the issuance of occupancy certificates in violation of regulations under the CRZ is also significant. The court has directed the Department of Science, Technology and Environment under the Govt. of Kerala to take immediate steps to move the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority and request the said authority to take a decision for modification or amendment of Coastal Zone Management Plan appropriately. This will ensure that the regulations are followed and the environment is protected.

Overall, the court's orders are a positive step towards protecting the environment and addressing the concerns of the residents of small islands in Kerala. The court has recognized the need for relaxation in the distance rule in the case of small islands in appropriate cases and has directed the competent authority to redress the grievances of the inhabitants. The court has also sent a strong message to local statutory authorities that they must comply with the regulations and take necessary steps to protect the environment.
