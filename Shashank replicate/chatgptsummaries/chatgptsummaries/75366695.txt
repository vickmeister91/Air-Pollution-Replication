The court orders discussed pertain to a case where the assessee had claimed credit for 15% of gross receipts as an exemption from income tax under Section 11 of the Income Tax Act. The Assessing Officer had denied the claim, but the CIT (Appeals) had allowed it, citing the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of A.L.N. Rao Charitable Trust. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Chandigarh heard two appeals filed by the assessee against orders of the CIT(A) Shimla dated 23.07.2014. The assessee challenged the order of the CIT(A) in denying the benefit of 15% accumulation amounted to Rs. 2,61,86,197/- under section 11(1) of the Act as claimed by the assessee and benefit of 85% accumulation of Rs. 11,81,70,581/- under section 11(2) of the Act as claimed by the assessee.

The Tribunal found that the issue was covered in favor of the assessee by a previous order and allowed the statutory benefit of 15% accumulation under section 11(1)(a) of the Act amounting to Rs. 2.61 Crores. The court order reproduces the relevant sections of the Income Tax Act and the Supreme Court's judgment to explain the exemption and accumulation of income for charitable purposes. The court order discusses the provisions of section 11(1)(a) and 11(2) of the Income Tax Act. It clarifies that there is a blanket exemption of 25% of gross receipts for trusts and societies registered under section 12AA of the Income Tax Act.

The court also explains that section 11(2) does not restrict the exemption provided by section 11(1)(a), but rather enlarges it. The court provides an illustration of how the combined operation of section 11(1)(a) and section 11(2) would work. The court also compares the provisions of section 11(1)(a) and 11(2) as they were in force in 1968-69 and in 2009-2010. The court concludes that section 11(a) was almost identical during both periods, and section 11(2), even as amended, does not cut across the exemption provided by section 11(1)(a).

The court order explains that Section 11(2) of the Income Tax Act does not override the exemption provisions in Section 11(1)(a) for accumulated income from the previous year. If any accumulated income remains after Section 11(1)(a) has been applied, Section 11(2) can be used to earn exemption from income tax. The court also refers to a table outlining the provisions for exemption and taxability of income derived from property held under charitable or religious trust. The appellant is eligible for a 15% exemption of gross receipts under Section 11(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act.

The court order allows the appellant to receive a 15% exemption of gross receipts under section 11(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act, amounting to Rs. 1,47,80,028/-. The court dismisses the ground of appeal by the Revenue and allows the appeal of the assessee. The court sets aside the orders of authorities below and directs the Assessing Officer to grant the benefit of 15% accumulation of the amount in question. The appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.

In summary, the court orders discussed pertain to a case where the assessee had claimed credit for 15% of gross receipts as an exemption from income tax under Section 11 of the Income Tax Act.
