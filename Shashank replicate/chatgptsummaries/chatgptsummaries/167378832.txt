The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Yamanappa against the Returning Officer of Prathamik Krushi Pattin Sahakari Bank. The petitioner had raised concerns regarding the calendar of events issued by the respondent for conducting the election to the committee of the management scheduled to be held on 7/3/2010. The petitioner had questioned the validity of the voters' list and had sought the court's intervention in ensuring a fair and transparent election process.

Upon hearing the arguments presented by both parties, the court found that the valid voters' list was in violation of Section 20(2)E of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Rules. This section mandates that the voters' list should be prepared at least 30 days prior to the date of the election and should be made available for inspection by the members of the society. The court observed that the respondent had failed to comply with this requirement and had prepared the voters' list just a few days before the election.

Despite finding the voters' list to be in violation of the rules, the court dismissed the petition as the election process had already commenced. The court noted that it would not be appropriate to halt the election process at this stage as it would cause inconvenience to the members of the society who had already started participating in the process. However, the court permitted the petitioner to raise a dispute if aggrieved by the election process.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition while allowing the petitioner to raise a dispute highlights the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations governing the conduct of elections. The court's decision also underscores the need for transparency and fairness in the election process, which is essential for upholding the principles of democracy.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Yamanappa against the Returning Officer of Prathamik Krushi Pattin Sahakari Bank. The court found that the valid voters' list was in violation of Section 20(2)E of the Karnataka Cooperative Societies Rules. However, since the election process had already commenced, the court dismissed the petition but permitted the petitioner to raise a dispute if aggrieved by the election process. The court's decision highlights the importance of adhering to the rules and regulations governing the conduct of elections and underscores the need for transparency and fairness in the election process.
