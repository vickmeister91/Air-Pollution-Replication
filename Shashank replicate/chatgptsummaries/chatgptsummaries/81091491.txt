The Patna High Court recently heard a case (Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.8665 of 2016) brought by M/s Shivam Int Udyog against the State of Bihar & Ors. The petitioner had been directed to stop the operation of its brick kiln in Madhubani district due to lack of consent to operate and environmental clearance. The petitioner argued that they had since obtained the necessary clearance and consent, but the application for consent to operate was still pending with the Bihar State Pollution Control Board due to the absence of the Chairman.

The court did not interfere with the restraint order issued by the Board and the District Magistrate, but required the State to provide a Chairman to the Board and inform the court of the timeline for doing so. The court order also added the Secretary concerned as respondent numbers 12 and 13 and requested the matter to be put up for orders on June 27, 2016.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary clearances and consents before operating any industrial unit. The petitioner had argued that they had obtained the necessary clearances and consents, but the delay in obtaining the consent to operate was due to the absence of the Chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. This highlights the need for a streamlined process for obtaining clearances and consents, and for ensuring that the necessary authorities are in place to process these applications in a timely manner.

The court's decision not to interfere with the restraint order issued by the Board and the District Magistrate is significant, as it underscores the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary clearances and consents before operating any industrial unit. The court's decision to require the State to provide a Chairman to the Board and inform the court of the timeline for doing so is also significant, as it highlights the need for a functional and effective regulatory framework for environmental clearances and consents.

The court order also adds the Secretary concerned as respondent numbers 12 and 13, which suggests that the court is taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the issues raised in the case. This is important, as it ensures that all relevant parties are involved in the proceedings and that the court's decision takes into account all relevant factors.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of complying with environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary clearances and consents before operating any industrial unit. It also underscores the need for a streamlined process for obtaining clearances and consents, and for ensuring that the necessary authorities are in place to process these applications in a timely manner. The court's decision not to interfere with the restraint order issued by the Board and the District Magistrate, and its requirement for the State to provide a Chairman to the Board and inform the court of the timeline for doing so, are significant steps towards ensuring a functional and effective regulatory framework for environmental clearances and consents.
