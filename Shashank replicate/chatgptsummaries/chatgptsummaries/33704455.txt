The court order in question pertains to an application for bail filed by Makhan Sonkar under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Sonkar was charged with an offense under sections 8/21 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The prosecution alleged that Sonkar was found in possession of a cheetah skin and 50 gms of smack/heroin during a police search. 

Sonkar's counsel argued that there was no compliance with the provisions of section 50 of the NDPS Act and that the drug had been planted on him. Section 50 of the NDPS Act lays down the procedure to be followed during the search of a person. It requires that the search be conducted in the presence of a gazetted officer or a magistrate and that a copy of the search memo be given to the person being searched. 

The court considered the arguments put forth by both sides and observed that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to show that the search was conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 50 of the NDPS Act. The court also noted that the prosecution had not produced any independent witness to corroborate the version of the police. 

In light of these observations, the court allowed Sonkar's application for bail upon his furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The court also directed Sonkar to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner. 

This court order highlights the importance of following the due process of law during the search and seizure of drugs. The NDPS Act lays down strict procedures to be followed during such searches, and any deviation from these procedures can result in the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court. In this case, the prosecution's failure to comply with the provisions of section 50 of the NDPS Act proved to be a crucial factor in the court's decision to grant bail to Sonkar. 

It is also worth noting that the court's decision to grant bail does not imply Sonkar's innocence. The trial court will still have to examine the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense before arriving at a verdict. However, the court's decision to grant bail does provide Sonkar with temporary relief from incarceration and allows him to prepare his defense in a better manner. 

In conclusion, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process of law during the search and seizure of drugs. It also highlights the need for the prosecution to produce credible evidence to support their case. The court's decision to grant bail to Sonkar underscores the principle of innocent until proven guilty and the importance of protecting the rights of the accused.
