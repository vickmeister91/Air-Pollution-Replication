The court order in question pertains to a case of criminal contempt against Nepal Singh, who had filed an incomplete copy of an FIR in a bail application for his relative, Mohan Lal, who was accused of murder. The court found that Singh had deliberately concealed the true facts and obstructed the administration of justice, and therefore, he was charged with criminal contempt under Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is a law that seeks to protect the dignity and authority of courts and to ensure that the administration of justice is not obstructed or interfered with in any way. The Act defines contempt of court as any act or omission that tends to interfere with the administration of justice or to lower the authority of the court.

The court will then decide on the appropriate punishment for Singh's contempt of court.

The punishment for contempt of court can range from a fine to imprisonment. The court will take into account the seriousness of the offence, the nature of the contempt, and the circumstances surrounding the offence when deciding on the appropriate punishment.

Contempt of court is a serious offence that can have serious consequences. It is important for individuals to respect the authority of the court and to cooperate with the administration of justice. Failure to do so can result in criminal charges and punishment.
