The court order in question is related to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that was filed in 2008 regarding the issue of traffic congestion and pollution in the city of Ranchi. Despite several orders passed by the court, the situation has not improved, and the court has now constituted a committee to look into the issues and suggest steps that can be taken to improve the situation.

The committee will be headed by the Secretary of the Department of Transport, Government of Jharkhand, and will include members from the Regional Transport Authority, State Pollution Board, and legal experts. The committee is expected to submit its report by May 15, 2012.

The court has also suggested that the state government consider prohibiting old vehicles and promoting the use of CNG and LPG vehicles. This is a significant step towards reducing pollution levels in the city, as old vehicles are known to emit higher levels of pollutants than newer ones. The promotion of CNG and LPG vehicles is also a positive move, as these vehicles are known to be more environmentally friendly than traditional petrol or diesel vehicles.

The court's decision to constitute a committee to look into the issue is a welcome move, as it shows that the court is taking the matter seriously and is committed to finding a solution to the problem. The inclusion of experts from various fields in the committee is also a positive step, as it ensures that the committee will have a well-rounded understanding of the issue and will be able to suggest effective solutions.

The committee's report, which is due by May 15, 2012, will be eagerly awaited by the court and the people of Ranchi. It is hoped that the report will provide concrete solutions to the issue of traffic congestion and pollution in the city and that the state government will take the necessary steps to implement these solutions.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the PIL filed in 2008 regarding traffic congestion and pollution in Ranchi is a significant step towards finding a solution to the issue. The constitution of a committee to look into the issue and suggest solutions, the inclusion of experts from various fields in the committee, and the suggestion to prohibit old vehicles and promote the use of CNG and LPG vehicles are all positive steps towards reducing pollution levels in the city. The committee's report, which is due by May 15, 2012, will be eagerly awaited, and it is hoped that it will provide effective solutions to the issue at hand.
