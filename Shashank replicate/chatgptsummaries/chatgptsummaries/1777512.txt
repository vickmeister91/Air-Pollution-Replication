The Kerala High Court recently heard two cases related to industrial activities and the role of the Pollution Control Board in regulating them. In the first case, the Marady Grama Panchayat had issued a notice to Rukhiya Beevi, a woman entrepreneur, to show cause as to why her industrial activities should not be stopped and her license cancelled for not obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the Pollution Control Board. Beevi argued that her industry was lawful and had been authorized to function by competent authorities. The court found that Beevi had made a case for interference and that her industrial activity could not be termed as irregular, unauthorized, or against public interest. 

The court also examined the justifiability of the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board and found that the Board had not properly examined the issue of whether a No Objection Certificate was required and had jumped to the conclusion that the unit was a highly polluting industry without sufficient evidence. The court noted that the Board had not followed the proper procedure for issuing a notice and had not given Beevi an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The court quashed the notice issued by the Panchayat and directed the Pollution Control Board to reconsider the matter in light of the court's observations.

In the second case, a small-scale industrial unit was denied consent to operate by the Pollution Control Board due to being categorized as a "most polluting, red category" unit. The court found that the Board did not have the authority to call any industry an "industrial plant" without proper investigation and evidence of pollution. The court also found that the Board's proceedings were pedestrian and lacked expertise. The court quashed the Board's decision and allowed the industrial unit to continue operating, provided they submit an application for a license to the Panchayat. The Board was ordered to pay the petitioner Rs. 500 as costs and refund the money received towards consent fee.

These cases highlight the importance of following due process and ensuring that decisions are based on proper investigation and evidence. The court's observations in both cases suggest that the Pollution Control Board had not followed the proper procedure and had not given the petitioners an opportunity to be heard before passing orders. The court's decision to quash the orders and direct the Board to reconsider the matter in light of the court's observations is a reminder that regulatory bodies must act fairly and transparently.

In the first case, the court's finding that Beevi's industrial activity was lawful and authorized by competent authorities is significant. It suggests that regulatory bodies must take into account the views of other authorities before passing orders that could affect the livelihoods of entrepreneurs. The court's observation that the Board had not properly examined the issue of whether a No Objection Certificate was required is also important. It suggests that regulatory bodies must follow the proper procedure and give due consideration to all relevant factors before passing orders.

In the second case, the court's finding that the Board did not have the authority to call any industry an "industrial plant" without proper investigation and evidence of pollution is significant. It suggests that regulatory bodies must have a sound basis for their decisions and cannot rely on assumptions or generalizations. The court's observation that the Board's proceedings were pedestrian and lacked expertise is also important. It suggests that regulatory bodies must have the necessary expertise and resources to make informed decisions.

Overall, these cases highlight the importance of following due process and ensuring that decisions are based on proper investigation and evidence. They also underscore the need for regulatory bodies to act fairly and transparently and to have the necessary expertise and resources to make informed decisions. By upholding the rights of entrepreneurs and ensuring that regulatory bodies act in accordance with the law, the court has played an important role in promoting economic growth and environmental protection in Kerala.
