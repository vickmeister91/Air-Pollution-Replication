The High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, recently issued two court orders in criminal appeals. The first order pertains to a complaint filed by Mahesh Sharma against Rahul Durugkar under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complaint was dismissed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nagpur, and the accused was acquitted. The appeal was admitted by the High Court for final hearing. The court discussed Section 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the complaint to be dismissed if the complainant does not appear and there are no reasons for the magistrate to adjourn the hearing. The court cited a Supreme Court judgment to explain the constraints on the court's power to dismiss the complaint under this section.

The court observed that the magistrate had dismissed the complaint without considering the reasons for the complainant's absence. The court noted that the complainant had filed an application for exemption from personal appearance, which was not considered by the magistrate. The court also observed that the magistrate had not given any reasons for not adjourning the hearing. The court held that the magistrate had not followed the procedure prescribed under Section 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code and had acted in a mechanical manner. The court set aside the order of the magistrate and remanded the case for fresh consideration.

The second court order pertains to a case where the complainant did not attend a hearing, and the defendant requested certain documents for further cross-examination. The magistrate dismissed the complaint and acquitted the defendant. The court found that the complainant's attendance was not necessary for the progress of the case, and the magistrate's decision to dismiss the complaint and acquit the defendant was capricious and not judicious. The court ordered the hearing to continue from the stage of cross-examination of the complainant and directed the application for production of documents to be decided independently.

The court observed that the magistrate had not considered the relevance of the documents sought by the defendant and had dismissed the application without giving any reasons. The court held that the magistrate had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code and had acted in a mechanical manner. The court set aside the order of the magistrate and directed the application for production of documents to be decided independently.

In both cases, the court emphasized the importance of following the procedure prescribed under the Criminal Procedure Code and the need for magistrates to give reasons for their decisions. The court also emphasized the need for magistrates to consider the relevance of documents sought by the parties and to decide applications for production of documents independently. The court's orders serve as a reminder to magistrates to act judiciously and follow the procedure prescribed under the law.
