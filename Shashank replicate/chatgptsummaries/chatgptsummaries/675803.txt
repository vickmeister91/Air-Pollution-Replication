The recent court order pertains to a case where the Conservator of Forests, Nizamabad Circle, forfeited a vehicle and two rifles belonging to the petitioners to the state under Section 39 (1)(d) of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, after compounding an offence on payment of compensation of Rs. 25,000/-. The petitioners had been suspected of hunting and killing a forest pig and three rabbits. However, the court held that once an offence has been compounded, it is not open for the authorities to confiscate the seized goods.

The court directed the respondents to release the vehicle and rifles of the petitioners.
