The case in question involves a petitioner named Rajesh Sidana who challenged an order passed by the District and Sessions Judge and a Special Judicial Magistrate in Sri Ganganagar. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C., which was partly allowed by the court. However, the court ultimately dismissed the criminal misc. petition, stating that there was no case for interference.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, it appears that the petitioner had sought the production of certain documents or other evidence in support of his case.

The District and Sessions Judge and the Special Judicial Magistrate had partially allowed the petitioner's application under Section 91, indicating that some of the documents or evidence sought by the petitioner were relevant and necessary for the case. However, the court ultimately dismissed the criminal misc. petition, indicating that there was no case for interference.

It is not entirely clear from the available information what the underlying case was about or what specific documents or evidence the petitioner had sought. However, it is possible that the court found that the evidence sought by the petitioner was not relevant or necessary for the case, or that the petitioner had not made a strong enough case for the court to intervene.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the criminal misc. petition suggests that the petitioner's challenge to the earlier order was not successful. It is unclear whether the petitioner has any further legal recourse in this matter, or whether the case has been fully resolved.
