The court order pertains to multiple cases related to mining activities of English India Clays Limited. The cases involve challenges to orders passed by the District Collector under the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, seeking police protection for mining and transportation of china clay, seeking interdiction of mining activities for lack of prior Environmental Clearance, and seeking expeditious consideration of the Company's application for Environmental Clearance. The court heard all the cases together and delivered a judgment on October 4, 2018.

The court order discusses a case involving mining activities carried out without obtaining prior environmental clearance (EC) and violating lease conditions. The court refers to various exhibits and judgments to argue for and against the grant of EC. The petitioners argue that the mining activity should be stopped and the value of minerals extracted recovered from the company, while the company argues that it has obtained necessary permits and approvals. The court agrees with a previous order that found suppression on the part of one of the petitioners.

The court order pertains to 13 connected cases and agrees with a previous Division Bench order regarding suppression on the part of Nizamuddin, who failed to mention an interim order in a new case. The court notes that the suppression is not serious enough to non-suit the appellants. The order also discusses the Company's failure to obtain an environmental clearance (EC) before commencing mining operations on leased land, as mandated by a 2006 notification. The court finds that the Company applied for an EC only in 2015, after already commencing activities on the leased land. The court also notes the Company's attempt to suppress pending litigation before the Division Bench.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents living near a mining area. The company, in its counter-affidavit, claims that the allegations of residential buildings being within 50 meters of the mining area are incorrect. The mining operations are confined to areas belonging to the company, and the company had ownership over only 26.6 acres of land in the total lease area of 35 acres. The court finds that the mining activity commenced by the company without a prior environmental clearance is illegal. The court also notes that the SEAC had recommended against issuing an EC due to violations of the notification dated 27.01.1994. The court rejects the company's contention that no violation was ever put to them.

The court order states that the company in question had violated environmental regulations and carried out mining operations without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The government had not taken any action against the violations, despite being aware of them. The court also notes that the company had not obtained consent from all landowners before commencing operations, and had coerced some into selling their land for low prices. The court criticizes the government for its lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing environmental regulations and for allowing the company to continue its illegal activities. The court also cites a report by the State's own Directorate of Mining and Geology, which highlights the environmental damage caused by the mining operations.

The court order states that the government has not taken any action to stop mining activities that are causing harm to the environment and people's lives. The court refers to various reports and documents that show the government's knowledge of the situation. The court also criticizes the government for allowing the violations to continue and cites previous litigation on the same issue. The court notes that the government has granted renewals to existing permits despite the illegality of such actions. The court also discusses amendments to the rules governing mining permits and criticizes the government's support for quarries.

The court order states that any lease continuing on the date of the Apex Court's judgment on 27.02.2012 and the Office Memorandum dated 18.05.2012 required environmental clearance at the time of renewal. The court also emphasized the need for environmental clearance for mining of minor minerals. The court found the notifications of the Government of Kerala permitting short-term mining permits to be illegal. The court also noted that sustained development is necessary, especially in the context of recent floods and landslides, and that laws and officers to implement them must be effectively enforced to prevent environmental damage.

The court order discusses a case of illegal mining that has caused environmental damage and resulted in natural calamities. The court finds that the mining company did not obtain the necessary environmental clearances and violated the Environment Protection Act and EIA notifications. The court orders the company to stop mining activities and restore the paddy land as mandated in the Paddy Land Act. The court also directs the government to implement the judgment in Common Cause and conduct an inspection of the site.

The court has ordered the formation of a team to inspect and assess the illegal extraction of China clay and overburden from a mining site in violation of the mining plan. The District Collector may take possession of the land to facilitate an independent inquiry. The company involved has been found guilty of abuse of process and has been ordered to pay exemplary costs of Rs. 10 lakhs to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund. Private parties who were not impleaded in a writ petition seeking EC for mining have been treated unfairly, and the company has been ordered to pay costs of Rs. 10,000 each to the petitioners. The State has been directed to initiate prosecution against the officials of the company and the erring officers of the State under the Environment Protection Act.
