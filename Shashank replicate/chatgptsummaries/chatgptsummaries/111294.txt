In the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors, the Supreme Court of India issued a court order on May 12, 2000, to determine the amount of pollution fine to be imposed on a motel that had violated environmental laws. The court had previously given directions to cancel the lease granted to the motel and restore the area to its original natural conditions. The court also directed the motel to pay compensation for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area and to remove the pollution caused by various constructions made by the motel.

The court ordered NEERI to inspect the area and give an assessment of the cost likely to be incurred for reversing the damage caused by the motel to the environment and ecology of the area. The court also directed the motel to construct a boundary wall and not discharge untreated effluents into the river. The court held that any disturbance of the basic environment elements, namely air, water, and soil, which are necessary for life, would be hazardous to life within the meaning of Article 21 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses the "Polluter Pays Principle" and the obligation of those who cause pollution to pay for the damage caused to the environment. The court has awarded damages against those responsible for disturbing the ecological balance and enforces this principle in various cases. The court also discusses the provisions for penalties and procedures for contravention of environmental protection laws.

The court cannot impose a pollution fine without a trial and finding of guilt, and the power of Article 142 of the Constitution cannot be used to ignore substantive rights of a litigant. The court order states that while Article 142 of the Constitution gives the court curative powers, it cannot be used to ignore substantive rights of a litigant or supplant substantive law applicable to the case. The court cannot ignore the provisions of a statute and pass orders concerning an issue that can only be settled through a mechanism prescribed in another statute.

The court withdraws the notice for pollution fine against M/s Span Motel but directs a fresh notice to be issued for exemplary damages. The person guilty of causing pollution has to pay damages for restoration of the environment and ecology and also to those who have suffered loss. The court directs a fresh notice to be issued to M/s Span Motel to show cause why exemplary damages should not be awarded in addition to damages. This question shall be heard at the time of quantification of damages under the main judgment.

In summary, the court order in the case of M.C. Mehta vs Kamal Nath & Ors emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and ecology and enforcing the "Polluter Pays Principle." The court directs the motel to pay compensation for the restitution of the environment and ecology of the area and to remove the pollution caused by various constructions made by the motel. The court also orders NEERI to inspect the area and give an assessment of the cost likely to be incurred for reversing the damage caused by the motel to the environment and ecology of the area.
