However, the court's decision to allow the accused persons to surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material is also significant. This indicates that the court is willing to give the accused persons an opportunity to cooperate with the investigation and provide any information that may be relevant to the case.

The court's direction that the application for regular bail be considered by the Magistrate having jurisdiction preferably on the same date on which it is filed is also significant.

Overall, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of wildlife protection and the need for strict enforcement of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the accused persons and allow them to surrender for interrogation and recovery of incriminating material is a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of both the accused persons and the state. The court's direction to consider the application for regular bail on the same date on which it is filed is also a positive step towards ensuring speedy justice in the case.
