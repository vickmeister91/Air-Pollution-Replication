The Delhi High Court recently heard three petitions filed by Manish Parwani and Shekhar Narasimhan to quash three criminal complaint cases against them under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complainant company, M/s Appreciate Fincap Private Limited, had filed the complaints against the petitioners and others for bouncing cheques. The court heard the case and reserved judgment on April 28, 2010, and delivered the judgment on May 3, 2010.

The court order pertains to a case where cheques issued by a company bounced due to insufficient funds. The complainant company filed three complaints against the accused persons, including the company's directors, under Sections 138/142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The accused directors argued that they had resigned from the company before the commission of the offence and, therefore, could not be held liable. The court examined the legal issue of whether the directors could be held vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company after they had resigned. The court discussed the provisions of Section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act and examined the responsibility of persons in charge of a company's conduct of business.

The court order discusses Section 141 of the NI Act, which regulates offences by companies and holds liable every person who, at the time the offence was committed, was in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. The court clarifies that not every person connected with the company falls within the ambit of the provision, and liability arises only from being in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company at the relevant time. The court also examines the role and functions of key managerial personnel as engaged by companies.

The court order provides definitions of various terms related to the Companies Act and discusses the vicarious liability of directors in cases of offenses committed by a company. The court states that only those directors who were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of the offense can be held liable. The court also notes that the complainant must make specific averments to make the accused vicariously liable and that vicarious liability cannot be inferred. The court ultimately finds that the petitioners cannot be held vicariously liable for the offense in question as there is nothing to show that they were responsible for the day-to-day management of the company.

The court order pertains to a case where the accused took over management of a company and borrowed a loan of Rs. 1,10,10,000 from the complainant. The accused issued cheques to repay the loan, but one of the cheques was dishonored. The complainant filed a complaint against the accused, including the two petitioners. However, the court found that the petitioners had resigned from the company before the incident and had no financial stake or control over the company. Therefore, the court quashed the summoning orders against the petitioners and allowed the complaints to continue against the remaining accused persons.

In summary, the Delhi High Court heard three petitions filed by Manish Parwani and Shekhar Narasimhan to quash three criminal complaint cases against them under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court examined the legal issue of whether the directors could be held vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company after they had resigned. The court discussed the provisions of Section 141(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act and examined the responsibility of persons in charge of a company's conduct of business. The court ultimately found that the petitioners cannot be held vicariously liable for the offense in question as there is nothing to show that they were responsible for the day-to-day management of the company. The court quashed the summoning orders against the petitioners and allowed the complaints to continue against the remaining accused persons.
