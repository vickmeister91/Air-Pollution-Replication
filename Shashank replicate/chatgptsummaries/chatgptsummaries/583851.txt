Two court orders were recently issued in India regarding disputes over the excisability and dutiability of waste liquor and aluminium dross and skimmings. The first case was heard by the Customs, Excise and Gold Tribunal in Delhi, which considered an appeal against a demand for duty and penalty imposed by the Collector, Central Excise on Gujarat State Fertilizers Co. The dispute centered around whether waste liquor I and waste liquor II, obtained as by-products during the manufacture of caprolactum, were excisable and dutiable. The tribunal ultimately found that waste liquor I and waste liquor II were goods and marketable, and therefore excisable and dutiable. 

In addition to the issue of excisability, the tribunal also considered the issue of limitation and whether there was an estoppel for changing the approved classification. The appeal was ultimately dismissed, and the demand for duty and penalty was confirmed. This ruling highlights the importance of understanding the definition of "excisable goods" and the requirement that they must satisfy the test of marketability. 

The second court order discussed the issue of whether aluminium dross and skimmings are excisable goods and therefore subject to duty of excise. The court concluded that they are not considered marketable commodities and are merely refuse or ashes given out in the manufacturing process. The court also discussed the definition of "excisable goods" and the requirement that they must satisfy the test of marketability. 

Ultimately, the court found that waste liquor I and waste liquor II are not goods for the purpose of levy of Central Excise duty and that the demand for duty is hit by limitation and not sustainable in law. The appeal was allowed. This ruling highlights the importance of understanding the definition of "excisable goods" and the requirement that they must satisfy the test of marketability. 

In both cases, the courts were tasked with determining whether certain by-products of manufacturing processes were subject to excise duty. The rulings demonstrate the importance of understanding the definition of "excisable goods" and the requirement that they must satisfy the test of marketability. It is important for companies to carefully consider the potential excisability and dutiability of their by-products in order to avoid disputes with tax authorities.
