The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Prashant Pathak, who challenged the rejection of his application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The application sought the production of the service book of Investigating Officer Dev Vrat Mishra and certain questionnaires in respect of his appointment, promotion, etc. The trial court had rejected the application on the ground that the witness had already been cross-examined and that arguments relating to the appointment, posting, and promotion of the I.O. could be raised at the time of arguments.

The court, in its order, dismissed the revision petition, taking into consideration that the case was registered in 1995 and that the trial was still pending. The court observed that the application filed by the petitioner was not maintainable as the witness had already been cross-examined and the arguments relating to the appointment, posting, and promotion of the I.O. could be raised at the time of arguments.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for the production of the service book of the I.O. and the questionnaires in respect of his appointment, promotion, etc. The court noted that the petitioner had not shown how the production of these documents would be relevant to the case. The court also observed that the petitioner had not shown how the non-production of these documents had caused him any prejudice.

The court, therefore, held that the trial court had rightly rejected the application filed by the petitioner and that there was no merit in the revision petition. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference in the order passed by the trial court.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Prashant Pathak challenging the rejection of his application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court dismissed the revision petition, taking into consideration that the case was registered in 1995 and that the trial was still pending.
