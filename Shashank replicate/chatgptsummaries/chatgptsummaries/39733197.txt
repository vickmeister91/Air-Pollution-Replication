In a recent case, the petitioners filed a petition under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to quash a notice issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in connection with a First Information Report (FIR). The notice was found to be not in accordance with precedent law and the learned Public Prosecutor stated that no documents shall be called from the petitioners. Therefore, the notice under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was deemed to have no force and the petition was dismissed.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioners sought to quash a notice issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. which empowers a court to issue a notice to any person in possession of any document or thing to produce it before the court. The notice was issued in connection with an FIR, which is the first information recorded by the police in relation to a cognizable offence.

The petitioners argued that the notice was not in accordance with precedent law as it did not specify the documents or things that were required to be produced before the court. The learned Public Prosecutor, who represents the State in criminal proceedings, stated that no documents shall be called from the petitioners. The court, after considering the submissions of both parties, held that the notice under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. was deemed to have no force and the petition was dismissed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the notice was not in accordance with precedent law. The court held that a notice under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. must specify the documents or things that are required to be produced before the court. The court also held that the learned Public Prosecutor's statement that no documents shall be called from the petitioners was a clear indication that the notice was not necessary in the first place.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following precedent law in criminal proceedings. It also highlights the need for clarity and specificity in notices issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court's decision ensures that the petitioners are not unnecessarily burdened with producing documents or things that are not relevant to the case.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of following precedent law and ensuring clarity and specificity in notices issued under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court's decision ensures that the petitioners are not unnecessarily burdened with producing documents or things that are not relevant to the case. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to all stakeholders in the criminal justice system to adhere to the principles of justice and fairness.
