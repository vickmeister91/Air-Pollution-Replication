The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the acquittal of four individuals who were charged with violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The accused were charged with discharging trade effluent without prior consent and not installing a water treatment plant. However, the court examined the procedure for taking samples of effluents and found that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure. As a result, the court upheld the acquittal of the accused.

The court order stated that a messenger must take receipt of a sample from the laboratory and fees for analyses must be paid in advance or at the time of submission of the sample. The samples must be preserved as per the given instructions. The court found that there was a breach of Sections 21 and 47 of the Act and Rule 27 of the Rules, 1976, and therefore, the trial court was justified in acquitting the accused. The appeal was dismissed, and the judgment and order of acquittal were confirmed.

The case highlights the importance of following proper procedures when taking samples of effluents. The court found that the prosecution had not followed the proper procedure, which ultimately led to the acquittal of the accused. This case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in such cases to ensure that proper procedures are followed to avoid any legal complications.
