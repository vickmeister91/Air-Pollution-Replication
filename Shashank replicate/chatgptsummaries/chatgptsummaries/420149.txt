The Patna High Court recently heard a case involving Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited and the State of Bihar regarding the meaning of a "metallurgical industry" under the Water (Prevention and Control) of Pollution Cess Act, 1977. The company claimed it was an engineering industry and not a metallurgical industry, and therefore not liable to pay the cess. The court considered various definitions of metallurgy and ultimately held that the company was engaged in a metallurgical industry and was liable to pay the cess.

The court order pertains to a case where the petitioner-company was disputing the applicability of the Cess Act to their industry. The court had to determine whether the petitioner's industry fell under the definition of "metallurgical industry" as specified in the Act. The court examined various definitions of metallurgy and concluded that the dominant purpose of a metallurgical industry is to extract ores, refine them, and convert them into steel, whereas the dominant purpose of an engineering industry is to manufacture finished products using steel. The court held that the petitioner's industry did not fall under the definition of metallurgical industry and therefore was not subject to the Cess Act. The court also noted that in case of doubt in a fiscal statute, the interpretation that is favourable to the taxpayer should be accepted.

The court order discusses a case involving a company in the metallurgical industry and their liability to pay a cess for discharging polluted water. The court found that the Cess Act did not apply to the petitioner-industry and that any doubt in interpretation should be resolved in favor of the subject. The court also found that the assessment of the cess was not correct as it was levied on the entire industry instead of just the metallurgical part. The order quashed the demand notice and delinked other writ petitions from the case.
