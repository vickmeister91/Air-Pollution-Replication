The court order pertains to a writ petition filed in public interest to stop indiscriminate mining of sand on fertile agricultural land in various villages in Haryana. The court had earlier elicited the views of specialists in the agriculture sector and impleaded the Haryana Agriculture University as a party to one of the petitions to determine the environmental hazards involved in mining of sand from agricultural land in the state.

The court had stopped the ongoing mining activity in the villages in question by an order dated 5th April 2006. The court had taken cognizance of the fact that indiscriminate mining of sand from agricultural land was causing irreparable damage to the environment and the fertility of the land. The court had also noted that the mining activity was being carried out in violation of the Auction Notice and the Notification dated 14th September 2006 issued by the Government of India.

The court had directed the respondent State Government and its agencies to ensure that the terms of the Auction Notice were strictly adhered to by the lessees concerned and no mining activity was allowed to be carried out except after obtaining proper clearance from State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority constituted in terms of the notifications mentioned above.

The court has now disposed of the petitions with a direction that the mining operations shall conform to the requirements of the Auction Notice and the Notification dated 14th September 2006 issued by the Government of India. The respondent State Government and its agencies shall ensure that the terms of the Auction Notice are strictly adhered to by the lessees concerned and no mining activity is allowed to be carried out except after obtaining proper clearance from State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority constituted in terms of the notifications mentioned above.

The court has made it clear that any violation of this policy can be re-agitated in appropriate proceedings before the court. The court has also directed that the petitions are disposed of with no costs.
