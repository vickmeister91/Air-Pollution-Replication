The Jharkhand High Court has issued an order for Ashok Poddar to appear before the court within three weeks in connection with a case related to illegal mining and running a crusher unit without proper certification. Poddar has been granted anticipatory bail, but the court has ordered him to surrender and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount.

The case against Poddar relates to allegations of illegal mining and running a crusher unit without proper certification. The court has ordered him to appear before it within three weeks to answer the charges against him.

Poddar has been granted anticipatory bail, which means that he will not be arrested if he surrenders and furnishes the bail bond and sureties as ordered by the court. However, he will be required to appear before the court to face the charges against him.

The court's order is significant because it shows that the judiciary is taking a strong stance against illegal mining and other environmental violations. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Poddar also shows that the judiciary is willing to balance the rights of the accused with the need to protect the environment and enforce the law.

Overall, the court's order in this case is a positive development for environmental protection and the rule of law in Jharkhand. It sends a clear message that illegal mining and other environmental violations will not be tolerated, and that those who engage in such activities will be held accountable for their actions.
