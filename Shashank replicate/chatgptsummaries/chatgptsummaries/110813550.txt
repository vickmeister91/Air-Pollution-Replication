In 2015, the Supreme Court of India heard a batch of writ petitions challenging the constitutionality of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act of 2000 and Section 69A, which gives the government the power to block public access to any information through any computer resource. The petitioners argued that Section 66A infringes the fundamental right to free speech and expression and is not saved by any of the eight subjects covered in Article 19(2). The court ultimately declared Section 66A unconstitutional and struck it down.

The court order discusses the importance of freedom of speech and expression in a democratic society. It cites various judgments, including the "marketplace of ideas" concept from American law, and emphasizes the need to tolerate unpopular views. The order also explains the three fundamental concepts of discussion, advocacy, and incitement in relation to freedom of speech and expression. It notes the differences between the US First Amendment and Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution, particularly in terms of the eight subject matters under which restrictions can be imposed in India. The order concludes that American judgments have persuasive value on the content of freedom of speech and expression, but there is a difference in sub-serving the general public interest.

The court order discusses the constitutional validity of laws penalizing libel, sedition, and obscene publications. The court states that American decisions on freedom of speech are not applicable to resolving questions arising under Article 19(1)(a) or (b) of the Indian Constitution. The court then examines the challenge made to Section 66A, which casts a wide net over all information disseminated over the internet. The court finds that Section 66A directly affects the public's right to know and curbs freedom of speech and expression. The court also discusses the meaning of "reasonable restrictions" and how they should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

The court order discusses the concept of reasonable restrictions on free speech and expression, particularly in relation to the internet. The court acknowledges that there may be differences between the internet and other mediums of communication, but maintains that the same tests for reasonableness must be applied. The court also notes that separate offences may be created for free speech over the internet, but any such laws must still be tested for their constitutionality. The court cites previous cases and emphasizes the importance of balancing the right to free speech with the need for regulation in the public interest.

The court order discusses the potential danger of allowing only a few affluent individuals to own and manipulate news and views through the use of surplus or unlimited frequencies. This poses a threat to the freedom of speech and expression of those who do not have access to truthful information. The court also discusses the concept of public order and how it relates to the maintenance of law and order. The court lays down a test to determine whether an act leads to disturbance of the current life of the community or merely affects an individual. The court also discusses the "clear and present danger" test used by the US Supreme Court in various situations.

The court order discusses the unconstitutionality of Section 66A of the Indian Penal Code, which curtails freedom of expression on the internet. The court finds that the section does not concern itself with injury to reputation, incitement to an offense, or decency or morality. The court also rejects the argument that the section should be made workable by reading into it each of the subject matters contained in Article 19(2). The court declares Section 66A unconstitutional.

The court order discusses the case of Aveek Sarkar and Anr. vs. State of West Bengal and Ors. and the issue of Section 66A being too vague in its language, making it difficult for individuals to understand what conduct is prohibited and for authorities to administer the law without arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court cites previous cases where vague laws have been struck down as unconstitutional and emphasizes the importance of clear guidelines and standards in penal laws.

The court order discusses the issue of vague laws and how they can lead to arbitrary and discriminatory application. It also highlights the importance of clear and explicit standards for those who apply the laws. The court cites several cases, including one where an anti-noise ordinance was upheld because it fixed the time and place of noise disruption, and another where a statute regulating internet speech was deemed unconstitutional due to its lack of precision. The court also notes that the doctrine of vagueness is applicable in Indian constitutional law, as established in the case of K.A. Abbas v. The Union of India & Another.

The court order discusses the "void for vagueness" doctrine and its applicability to Indian laws affecting fundamental rights. The court states that while Indian laws cannot be declared invalid on the ground of violating the due process clause or being vague, a law affecting fundamental rights may be considered bad for vagueness. The court also emphasizes that if a law is vague, the court must try to construe it in accordance with the intention of the legislature. The court cites examples of laws that were struck down for being vague and imprecise.

The court order discusses the unconstitutionality of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act in India. The court finds that the language used in the section is vague and undefined, making it open to abuse and misuse. The court compares it to other sections of the Indian Penal Code and finds that those sections are more specific and clearly defined. The court also notes
