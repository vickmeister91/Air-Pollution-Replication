The court order under discussion pertains to the transfer of multiple writ petitions related to water pollution to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court cites the wide jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the need for a purposive interpretation of relevant provisions to achieve the objectives of the Act. The order emphasizes the necessity of transferring proceedings to the Tribunal for the settlement of disputes relating to the environment.

The court notes that while the Act does not mandate the transfer of pending cases to the Tribunal, the absence of such a provision suggests that such transfers are impermissible. The court order states that disputes involving substantial questions relating to the environment should be settled by the NGT, as outlined in the National Green Tribunal Act. The Act has an overriding effect and excludes the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters within the purview of the Tribunal.

The order cites a previous Supreme Court ruling that mandates the transfer of matters covered by the provisions of the Act to the Tribunal, whether pending prior to the coming into force of the Act or instituted thereafter, in order to avoid conflict of orders by it and the High Courts, and in the interest of expeditious and specialized justice in the field of environment to all concerned. The present writ petitions are disposed of on transfer to the National Green Tribunal.

The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, with the objective of providing effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment and has the power to hear appeals against orders of various environmental regulatory authorities.

The court order recognizes the importance of the NGT in addressing environmental disputes and highlights the need for a purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act to achieve its objectives. The order notes that the NGT has the expertise and specialized knowledge required to deal with complex environmental issues and that its jurisdiction should be respected and upheld.

The order also rejects the plea of inadequacy or inefficacy of the remedy provided by the Act and emphasizes the necessity of transferring proceedings to the Tribunal for the settlement of disputes relating to the environment. The court recognizes that the NGT has been established as a specialized forum for the resolution of environmental disputes and that its jurisdiction should be respected and upheld.

In conclusion, the court order emphasizes the importance of the National Green Tribunal in addressing environmental disputes and highlights the need for a purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act to achieve its objectives. The order recognizes the expertise and specialized knowledge of the Tribunal in dealing with complex environmental issues and emphasizes the necessity of transferring proceedings to the Tribunal for the settlement of disputes relating to the environment. The order also notes that the NGT has an overriding effect and excludes the jurisdiction of civil courts in matters within its purview.
