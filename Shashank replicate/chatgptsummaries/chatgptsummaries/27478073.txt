The case of Mohar Singh, who had been in custody since December 24, 2018, was brought before the court. Singh had filed a petition seeking regular bail in a case registered at Police Station Ramgarh, District Alwar for the offence under Section 9/51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that Singh and his co-accused had killed a blue bull. The trial was expected to take some time, and Singh had been in custody for a considerable period.

The court considered the petition and the arguments presented by both the prosecution and the defence. After careful consideration, the court allowed the petition and ordered the release of Singh on bail, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The Act aims to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats, prevent hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, and Section 51 provides for punishment for offences under the Act. The offence of killing a blue bull is a serious offence under the Act, and the prosecution had alleged that Singh and his co-accused had committed this offence.

The court's decision to grant bail to Singh was based on several factors. The court considered the nature of the offence, the evidence presented by the prosecution, and the length of time Singh had already spent in custody. The court also considered the possibility of Singh absconding or tampering with evidence if released on bail.

However, the court was satisfied that Singh was not a flight risk and that he would not tamper with evidence. The court also noted that Singh had no previous criminal record and that he had cooperated with the investigation. The court, therefore, allowed the petition and ordered the release of Singh on bail, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Mohar Singh was based on several factors, including the nature of the offence, the evidence presented by the prosecution, and the length of time Singh had already spent in custody. The court was satisfied that Singh was not a flight risk and that he would not tamper with evidence. The court, therefore, allowed the petition and ordered the release of Singh on bail, subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and the offence of killing a blue bull is a serious offence under the Act.
