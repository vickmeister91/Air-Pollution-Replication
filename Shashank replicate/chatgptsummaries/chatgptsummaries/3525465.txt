The court order in question pertains to a criminal case where the accused had been charged with dishonoring two cheques. The complainant had initiated the prosecution against the accused, and during the course of the trial, the accused had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking a direction to the complainant to produce his income tax returns and bank account details.

The trial court had dismissed the application, and the accused had subsequently filed a petition to set aside the order of dismissal. The High Court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked to conduct a fishing enquiry and that the trial court had rightly relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Debendranath Padi Vs State of Orissa.

The court observed that the trial court should proceed with the trial without being influenced by the observations made in the order. The order highlights the importance of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and its limitations in conducting a fishing enquiry.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is intended to enable the court to obtain relevant documents or things that are necessary for the fair and just disposal of a case.

However, the section cannot be used to conduct a fishing enquiry or to obtain documents or things that are not relevant to the case. The Supreme Court, in Debendranath Padi Vs State of Orissa, had held that the power under Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be used to compel a person to produce documents or things that are not relevant to the case.

The High Court, in the present case, upheld the trial court's decision to dismiss the accused's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court observed that the accused had not made out a case for the production of the complainant's income tax returns and bank account details. The court held that the accused had failed to show how the documents were relevant to the case and how they would assist in the fair and just disposal of the case.

The court also observed that the accused's application was nothing but a fishing enquiry, and the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked to conduct such an enquiry. The court held that the trial court had rightly dismissed the application, and there was no reason to interfere with the trial court's order.

The court's order highlights the importance of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and its limitations. The section is intended to enable the court to obtain relevant documents or things that are necessary for the fair and just disposal of a case. However, the section cannot be used to conduct a fishing enquiry or to obtain documents or things that are not relevant to the case.

The court's order also emphasizes the need for parties to a case to make out a case for the production of documents or things under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The party seeking the production of documents or things must show how the documents or things are relevant to the case and how they would assist in the fair and just disposal of the case.

In conclusion, the court's order in the present case highlights the importance of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and its limitations. The section is intended to enable the court to obtain relevant documents or things that are necessary for the fair and just disposal of a case. However, the section cannot be used to conduct a fishing enquiry or to obtain documents or things that are not relevant to the case. The court's order also emphasizes the need for parties to a case to make out a case for the production of documents or things under Section 91 Cr.P.C.
