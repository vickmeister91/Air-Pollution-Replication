The court order in question pertains to a dispute between the Raja of Jherria and Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi over the interpretation of a royalty clause in a lease agreement. The clause in question provides for a royalty payment of three annas per ton of coal and rubble, with an enhanced rate of five annas per ton if the freight on coal is reduced by two annas or more per ton due to the construction of the Bengal Nagpur Railway.

The dispute centers around the interpretation of the enhanced royalty clause. The lessee, Maharaja Manindra Chandra Nandi, argues that the enhanced royalty only applies to coal transported over the Bengal Nagpur Railway, while the lessor, the Raja of Jherria, contends that it applies to all coal transported by rail at a reduced rate, regardless of the railway used.

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court ultimately rules in favor of the lessor. The court finds that the enhanced royalty applies to all coals despatched by rail at a reduced rate, regardless of whether they are sent over the Bengal Nagpur system or the East Indian Company's line. This ruling is significant as it clarifies the scope of the enhanced royalty clause and ensures that the lessor receives the full benefit of the clause.

In addition to ruling on the interpretation of the royalty clause, the court also addresses a procedural issue raised by the lessee. The lessee argues that he should be allowed to raise a new issue on appeal that was not raised before the lower courts. However, the court rejects this argument, stating that the lessee had ample opportunity to raise the issue in the lower courts and cannot now raise it on appeal.

As a result of these rulings, the court dismisses the case with costs. This means that the lessee will be responsible for paying the costs associated with the legal proceedings, including the fees of the lawyers and court costs.

Overall, this court order provides important clarification on the interpretation of a royalty clause in a lease agreement. It also underscores the importance of raising all relevant issues in the lower courts, as failure to do so may result in those issues being barred from consideration on appeal.
