Dr. Neeraj Pathak, who was facing trial for an offence under Section 498-A of IPC, challenged the order of the JMFC, Chhatarpur, which dismissed his application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The applicant had moved an application for calling a document under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The document in question was a certificate given by doctors of AIIMS, New Delhi, which was sent to the police officers by Fax. However, the ink faded, and therefore, a certified copy of the document could not be given by the head copyist.

The court rejected the application, stating that if the prosecution document is not proved by the prosecution, then the court shall take an adverse inference of the prosecution, and advantage will be received to the applicant. The court held that the document in question was not a public document, and therefore, the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. were not applicable. The court further held that the document was not relevant to the case, and therefore, the application was dismissed.

The applicant then filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. before the High Court, challenging the order of the JMFC. The High Court dismissed the petition, holding that the order of the JMFC was not erroneous, and there was no ground to interfere with the same. The High Court held that the document in question was not a public document, and therefore, the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. were not applicable. The High Court further held that the document was not relevant to the case, and therefore, the application was rightly dismissed by the JMFC.

The High Court also observed that the prosecution had not relied upon the document in question, and therefore, the question of calling the document under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. did not arise. The High Court held that the prosecution was not obliged to prove every document that was in its possession, and it was for the prosecution to decide which documents it wanted to rely upon. The High Court further held that the trial court was entitled to take an adverse inference against the prosecution if it failed to prove a document that was relevant to the case.

The High Court also observed that the applicant had an alternative remedy available to him, and he could have sought the production of the document under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. during the trial. The High Court held that the applicant had failed to show any exceptional circumstances that warranted the exercise of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court held that the order of the JMFC was not erroneous, and there was no ground to interfere with the same. The court held that the document in question was not a public document, and therefore, the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. were not applicable. The court further held that the document was not relevant to the case, and therefore, the application was rightly dismissed by the JMFC. The court also observed that the prosecution was not obliged to prove every document that was in its possession, and it was for the prosecution to decide which documents it wanted to rely upon. The court held that the trial court was entitled to take an adverse inference against the prosecution if it failed to prove a document that was relevant to the case. The court also held that the applicant had an alternative remedy available to him, and he could have sought the production of the document under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. during the trial.
