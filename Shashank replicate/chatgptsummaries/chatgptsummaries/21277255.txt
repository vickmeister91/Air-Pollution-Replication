The first court order pertains to a case where a petitioner challenged a notification issued by Utkal University revising the result of the B.Ed. Examination (General) 2006, which declared her as "Fail" by revising the previous result of "2nd Class". The petitioner argued that she was provided with a provisional pass certificate and mark sheet declaring her as pass in 2nd Division in B.Ed. (General) Examination, 2006, and subsequently, the impugned notification should not have been issued declaring her fail without assigning any reason.

The court heard both parties and found that the petitioner was failed in two written papers, and the "hard case rule" was applied to her case in order to declare her pass. However, she was awarded 17 marks wrongly, and when the same was detected, it was placed before the Board of Conducting Examiners, which revised the result of the B.Ed. (General) Examination, 2006. As a result, some of the candidates, including the petitioner, were declared fail, as reflected in the impugned notification of the University dated 03.02.2007.

The court found that the petitioner was not entitled to any relief as the University had revised the result of the examination after detecting the mistake. The court held that the University had the power to revise the result of the examination if any mistake was detected, and the petitioner was not entitled to any relief as the University had acted within its powers.

The second court order discusses a complaint made by Dr. S.M. Pani regarding the implementation of the "hard case rule" in the B.Ed. Examination of the University. The Conducting Board of Examiners convened a meeting and decided to revise the result of the examination due to the wrong implementation of the rule. The old "hard case rule" was applied to the candidates who appeared for the examination, and their results were revised accordingly. The petitioner and four other candidates were declared fail.

The court stated that if a mistake was committed by the authority and rectified by revising the result, no illegality or irregularity has been committed. The writ application was dismissed.

In both cases, the court held that the University had the power to revise the result of the examination if any mistake was detected. The court also held that if a mistake was committed by the authority and rectified by revising the result, no illegality or irregularity has been committed. The court dismissed the writ application in the second case, and the petitioner was not entitled to any relief in the first case.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the importance of conducting examinations with utmost care and diligence. The court has the power to intervene if any illegality or irregularity is committed by the authority. However, if a mistake is committed and rectified by revising the result, no illegality or irregularity has been committed. The court's decision in both cases reinforces the principle of fairness and transparency in the conduct of examinations.
