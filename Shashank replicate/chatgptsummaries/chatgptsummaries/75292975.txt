The court order pertains to a bail application filed by two individuals, Majubhai Surjibhai Kharad and another person, in relation to a case registered under the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The court has issued a rule returnable on September 21, 2017, requiring the two individuals to appear along with another criminal miscellaneous application. The bail application of the co-accused is also scheduled to be heard on the same day.

The Gujarat Prohibition Act, enacted in 1949, prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in the state of Gujarat. The act imposes strict penalties on those who violate its provisions, including fines and imprisonment. The case in question likely involves allegations of violating the provisions of the act.

The bail application filed by Majubhai Surjibhai Kharad and the other individual seeks release from custody while the case is pending. Bail is a legal process that allows a person accused of a crime to be released from custody while awaiting trial. The court may grant bail if it determines that the accused is not a flight risk and is unlikely to commit further crimes while out on bail.

The court has issued a rule returnable on September 21, 2017, which means that the two individuals must appear in court on that date. The purpose of the appearance is to provide the court with an opportunity to hear arguments from both sides and make a decision on the bail application. The court may grant bail, deny bail, or impose conditions on the release of the accused.

In addition to the bail application, the court has also scheduled another criminal miscellaneous application to be heard on September 21, 2017. A criminal miscellaneous application is a legal request made to the court in a criminal case that is not related to the main case. It is unclear what the nature of this application is, but it is likely that it is related to the same case as the bail application.

The fact that the bail application of the co-accused is also scheduled to be heard on the same day suggests that there are multiple individuals involved in the case. It is possible that the co-accused is a codefendant in the case or is otherwise implicated in the alleged violation of the Gujarat Prohibition Act.

Overall, the court order is a routine procedural step in a criminal case involving allegations of violating the Gujarat Prohibition Act. The court has issued a rule returnable on September 21, 2017, requiring the two individuals to appear in court along with another criminal miscellaneous application. The purpose of the appearance is to provide the court with an opportunity to hear arguments from both sides and make a decision on the bail application. The fact that the co-accused's bail application is also scheduled to be heard on the same day suggests that there are multiple individuals involved in the case.
