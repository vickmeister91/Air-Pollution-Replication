The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed a group of petitions filed by Maheshkumar Virjibhai Trivedi and others, who had requested the quashing of an order and subsequent actions taken by the state of Gujarat to take possession of lands allotted to them. The land in question was within the Wild Ass Sanctuary, and necessary notifications had been issued under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court found that the petitioners' rights were not accepted by the competent authority, and that possession of the land could not be protected.

The petitioners had argued that they had been allotted the land in question by the government, and that they had been in possession of the land for many years. They claimed that they had invested a significant amount of money in developing the land, and that they had been using it for agricultural purposes. They argued that the government's decision to take possession of the land was arbitrary and illegal, and that it violated their fundamental rights.

The court, however, found that the petitioners' rights were not accepted by the competent authority, and that possession of the land could not be protected. The court noted that the land in question was within the Wild Ass Sanctuary, and that necessary notifications had been issued under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court held that the government had the power to take possession of the land in order to protect the wildlife in the sanctuary, and that the petitioners' rights could not override this power.

The court also noted that the petitioners had been allowed to approach the competent authority for the allotment of other lands in accordance with the government resolution dated 4.12.1978. The court held that the petitioners could not claim a right to the land in question, and that they were not entitled to any compensation for the loss of the land.

The court dismissed the petitions and discharged the rule in each petition, with no order as to costs. The court's decision is a significant victory for the government, which has been facing increasing pressure from environmental groups to protect the country's wildlife sanctuaries. The decision also highlights the importance of following the necessary legal procedures when dealing with land allotment and possession issues.
