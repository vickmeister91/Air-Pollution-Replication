The Delhi High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Sports & Leisure Apparel Ltd. seeking directions to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to not take any coercive action against the display made by the petitioner at its outlet in New Delhi. The respondent had previously imposed damages on the petitioner for unauthorized display of a "Two Wall Wrap" at the same premises. The petitioner argued that the proposed action of removal of the display by the respondent was illegal and arbitrary.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the relief sought by the petitioner had already been adjudicated in a previous case and that the petitioner's representation seeking permission for display had already been rejected by the respondent. The court further observed that the petitioner had not challenged the order imposing damages on them for the unauthorized display, and therefore, the same had attained finality.

The petitioner had contended that the display was not unauthorized and that they had sought permission from the respondent for the same. However, the respondent had rejected their representation, and the petitioner had not challenged the same. The court noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that they had sought permission for the display.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the order imposing damages on them for the unauthorized display. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to challenge the order imposing damages in a petition seeking directions to not take any coercive action against the display.

The court further held that the petitioner could not be allowed to seek relief in the present petition, which had already been adjudicated in a previous case. The court observed that the petitioner had already sought relief in a previous case, and the same had been rejected. The court held that the petitioner could not be allowed to seek the same relief again in the present petition.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court dismissed the petition filed by Sports & Leisure Apparel Ltd. seeking directions to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation to not take any coercive action against the display made by the petitioner at its outlet in New Delhi. The court held that the relief sought by the petitioner had already been adjudicated in a previous case and that the petitioner's representation seeking permission for display had already been rejected by the respondent. The court further observed that the petitioner had not challenged the order imposing damages on them for the unauthorized display, and therefore, the same had attained finality.
