The court recently rejected an anticipatory bail application filed by Rajendra Shivraya Gangde in connection with a case registered against him for illegal excavation of sand and violation of the Environment Protection Act. The court noted that the applicant's ownership of one of the unnumbered vehicles used in the crime was established and that he had used the same vehicle in another similar offence. The court found that his custodial interrogation was necessary to determine who had helped him in committing the offence.

The case against Gangde was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Environment Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that Gangde and his associates had illegally excavated sand from a riverbed and transported it using unnumbered vehicles. The prosecution further alleged that the excavation had caused damage to the environment and had violated the provisions of the Environment Protection Act.

Gangde had filed an anticipatory bail application before the court, seeking protection from arrest. He had argued that he was innocent and that he had been falsely implicated in the case. He had also contended that he had cooperated with the investigation and had provided all the necessary information to the police.

However, the court rejected his application, noting that the prosecution had established his ownership of one of the unnumbered vehicles used in the crime. The court also observed that Gangde had used the same vehicle in another similar offence, which indicated his involvement in the present case. The court further noted that Gangde's custodial interrogation was necessary to determine who had helped him in committing the offence.

The court's decision to reject Gangde's anticipatory bail application is significant as it underscores the importance of custodial interrogation in cases involving serious offences. Custodial interrogation allows the police to question the accused in a controlled environment and to gather evidence that may not be available otherwise. In this case, the court found that Gangde's custodial interrogation was necessary to determine the extent of his involvement in the offence and to identify his accomplices.

The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws. The excavation of sand from riverbeds is a common practice in many parts of India, and it often leads to environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity. The Environment Protection Act provides for strict penalties for such offences, including imprisonment and fines. The court's decision to reject Gangde's anticipatory bail application sends a strong message that such offences will not be tolerated and that the law will be enforced rigorously.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject Rajendra Shivraya Gangde's anticipatory bail application in connection with a case of illegal excavation of sand and violation of the Environment Protection Act underscores the importance of custodial interrogation in cases involving serious offences. The court found that Gangde's custodial interrogation was necessary to determine the extent of his involvement in the offence and to identify his accomplices. The decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and sends a strong message that such offences will not be tolerated.
