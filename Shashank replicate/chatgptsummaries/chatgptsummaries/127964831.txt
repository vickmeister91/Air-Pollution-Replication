The high court has granted custody of a vehicle seized in connection with a wildlife protection act violation to the petitioner, Robin Lal, in a recent court order. The lower courts had previously rejected Lal's application for custody, citing the provisions of the act. However, the high court found that the lower courts had misinterpreted the relevant sections of the act and that the custody of the vehicle could be granted to Lal. The court ordered the release of the vehicle on certain conditions.

The court order states that before releasing a vehicle, a proper Panchnama should be prepared, photographs of the vehicle should be taken, and a bond should be produced to ensure that the vehicle will be produced if required at the time of trial. Additionally, a personal bond of Rs.10 Lacs and a like sum of surety should be obtained before releasing the vehicle. The petition is allowed and the order is signed by Judge Goutam Bhaduri.

The case pertains to a violation of the wildlife protection act, which is a serious offense. The act is designed to protect endangered species and their habitats, and violations can result in significant penalties. In this case, the vehicle in question was seized as evidence of the violation. Lal, the petitioner, had applied for custody of the vehicle, but his application was rejected by the lower courts.

The high court's decision to grant custody of the vehicle to Lal is significant because it shows that the court is willing to interpret the provisions of the wildlife protection act in a way that is fair and just. The court found that the lower courts had misinterpreted the act and that Lal was entitled to custody of the vehicle. This decision is likely to have implications for future cases involving violations of the act.

The court order also sets out specific conditions that must be met before the vehicle can be released. These conditions are designed to ensure that the vehicle is produced if required at the time of trial. The preparation of a proper Panchnama and the taking of photographs of the vehicle are important steps in this process. The personal bond of Rs.10 Lacs and the like sum of surety are also important safeguards that will help to ensure that the vehicle is produced if required.

Overall, the court order in this case is an important decision that clarifies the provisions of the wildlife protection act and sets out specific conditions that must be met before a seized vehicle can be released. The decision to grant custody of the vehicle to Lal is significant because it shows that the court is willing to interpret the act in a way that is fair and just. The conditions set out in the order are important safeguards that will help to ensure that the vehicle is produced if required at the time of trial.
