The court order pertains to a lawsuit filed by Ram Rattan, the father of a deceased worker who died while cleaning sewer lines. Ram Rattan is seeking monetary compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs from the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), Government of NCT of Delhi, Government of Rajasthan, and two individuals. The plaintiff claims that the defendants are liable for the death of his son due to negligence. The defendants deny any responsibility and argue that the area falls under the jurisdiction of NDMC and CPWD has no contract with Rajasthan House to maintain any sewer line.

The court has framed issues related to the plaintiff's entitlement to compensation and interest. Witnesses and documents have been presented to prove the cause of death. The court has found that the plaintiff's case is proved and that the defendants are liable for compensation. The court has given a judgment in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the defendants to pay the compensation amount with interest.

The court notes that the son was drunk and negligent, but the court notes that it is common for people cleaning sewer lines to consume alcohol to tolerate the smell. The court also determines that the defendant, Sedu Ram, had a contract with the Rajasthan government to clean sewer lines and was responsible for the work at the Rajasthan House where the incident occurred. Sedu Ram's son carried out the work in his absence.

The court notes that there is a vicarious responsibility on the defendant for the acts of his agents. The court also applies the maxim res ipsa loquitur, which means that the accident speaks for itself, and holds the defendant liable for the death of the worker. The court cites previous cases that establish the right to life with dignity and a decent standard of living and the duty of care statutorily cast on the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

The court states that the state and its agencies have a constitutional obligation to ensure the safety of these workers and cannot absolve themselves of this responsibility. The court also discusses the concept of vicarious liability, where an employer cannot escape liability for the acts of its agents. The order concludes that the defendants in this case, including the government of Rajasthan, cannot escape liability for the death of a worker who was cleaning internal sewer lines.

The court cites previous cases to determine the calculation of damages, stating that compensation should be just and not a windfall, and that the death of an only son to a mother can never be compensated in monetary terms. The court also notes that determining compensation in death cases involves many imponderables and is a mixed question of fact and law.

The court refers to previous cases and guidelines for determining compensation. The court awards pecuniary damages for loss of income and non-pecuniary damages for mental pain and agony. The defendant is ordered to pay 75% of the compensation, and the government of Rajasthan is ordered to pay the remaining 25%. The plaintiff is also awarded interest on the compensation amount and the cost of litigation.

The court order states that the defendant no.4, Government of Rajasthan, must pay 75% of a certain amount mentioned in the order, with the remaining 25% to be paid by defendant no.6, Sedu Ram. The amount is to be split equally between the plaintiff and his wife, and must be paid within four months from the date of the order. No other relief is granted, and the decree sheet is to be prepared accordingly and filed in the record room. The order was announced in an open court on March 15, 2018.

In summary, the court order pertains to a lawsuit filed by Ram Rattan seeking compensation for the death of his son who died while cleaning sewer lines. The court has found the defendants liable for compensation and has ordered them to pay the amount with interest. The court has also discussed the concept of vicarious liability and the duty of care cast on the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The court has awarded pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages and has ordered the defendants to pay the compensation amount within four months.
