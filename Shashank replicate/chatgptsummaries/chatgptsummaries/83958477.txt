The Prohibition Act, under which the applicant was charged, is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain areas. The Act also provides for penalties for those who violate its provisions.

The court's decision to grant bail is not a final determination of the applicant's guilt or innocence. It is merely a decision to release him from custody while the trial is ongoing. The trial court will have to make its own independent assessment of the evidence presented before it and determine whether the applicant is guilty or not.
