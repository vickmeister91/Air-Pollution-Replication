The court recently issued an order in response to a challenge against a government notification that requires all Tipper Lorries to be fitted with a speed governor conforming to the standard AIS:018. The petitioners raised several contentions, including the authority of the state government to issue such a notification and the classification of Tipper Lorries as a class for the purpose of imposing the requirement to have speed governors. However, the court rejected these contentions and held that the government has the power to issue such a notification and that Tipper Lorries are a class by themselves.

The court also noted that there is an imminent need to have speed governors insisted upon for public safety. The court dismissed the writ petitions and upheld the government notification. This decision was made in order to give full effect to the judgment of the court in O.P. No. 34446/2000 and CCC. 1422/2003.

The court's decision to uphold the government notification requiring speed governors for Tipper Lorries is significant for several reasons. First, it affirms the authority of the state government to issue such notifications in the interest of public safety. This is particularly important given the high number of accidents involving Tipper Lorries in recent years.

Second, the court's decision recognizes the unique characteristics of Tipper Lorries as a class of vehicles. These vehicles are often used to transport heavy loads over long distances, and their size and weight can make them difficult to control at high speeds. By requiring speed governors for Tipper Lorries, the government is taking steps to reduce the risk of accidents and protect public safety.

Finally, the court's decision highlights the importance of adhering to established standards for speed governors. The AIS:018 standard is widely recognized as a reliable and effective means of regulating vehicle speed, and its use in this case ensures that all Tipper Lorries are subject to the same safety requirements.

Overall, the court's decision to uphold the government notification requiring speed governors for Tipper Lorries is a positive development for public safety. By recognizing the unique characteristics of these vehicles and the need for standardized safety measures, the court has taken an important step towards reducing the risk of accidents and protecting the lives of drivers and passengers on Indian roads.
