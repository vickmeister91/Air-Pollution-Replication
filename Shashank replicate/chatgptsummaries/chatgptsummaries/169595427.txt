The court order pertains to a criminal case in which the accused has filed a bail application and requested certain documents from the police. The court rejected the request, citing a previous decision that states the accused is not entitled to copies of statements recorded during the investigation before the forwarding of a report. The court cites previous cases to support its decision.

The court order states that the respondent has a substantial interest in the statements recorded because he was on remand, but the claim to copies was denied on the grounds that it would violate section 173(4) of the Code. The court also states that in a case where the Investigating Agency opposes bail, the material collected during the investigation should be disclosed to the accused. However, there is no general right to copies of statements recorded by the police during the course of investigation at an earlier stage. The court also notes that there is no provision for non-disclosure of material in this case, unlike in the Maintenance of Internal Security Act, 1971. Finally, the court states that section 124 of the Evidence Act, which states that no public officer shall be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence, would not be applicable to the statements recorded under section 161 of the Code.

The court order states that section 124 of the Evidence Act can only be applied when communication is made to a public officer in official confidence.

The investigating agency is bound to disclose material collected during the investigation to oppose the bail application of the petitioner. The court directs the investigating agency to disclose the material upon which they propose to oppose the bail application and give an opportunity to the accused to make submissions before coming to a conclusion on releasing the petitioner on bail or not.
