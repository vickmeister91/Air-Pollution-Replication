The court case in question involves a dispute over the payment of fair wages to laborers for work done in Madhya Pradesh. The petitioner claimed that the respondent was paid an amount in error and was liable to refund it. The arbitrator had upheld the payment made to the respondent and rejected the petitioner's claim. The court examined the concept of fair wages and the provisions of the General Conditions of Contract. 

The court found that the arbitrator had not taken into account the actual fair wage being paid by the respondent company and had only considered the base figure of Rs. 2/- for the minimum wage. The court also noted that the respondent company had claimed escalation on the basis of a basic wage of Rs. 2.70 per day. The court concluded that the maximum escalation available could not exceed Rs. 4/- per day, but the difference had to be calculated from the actual fair wage being paid by the respondent company.
