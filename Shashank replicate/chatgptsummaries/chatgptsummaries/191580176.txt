The court recently dismissed a petition filed by M/s Hotel Shivalik Retreat against the State of H.P. and others. The petitioner had raised concerns about the environmental impact of a proposed construction project in the area. However, the court ruled that the petitioner's contentions could be addressed through remedies provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of a specialized forum for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal (NGT) and several regional benches to hear and dispose of cases related to environmental issues.

In this case, the court held that the petitioner could approach the NGT to seek redressal of their grievances. The NGT has the power to hear and dispose of cases related to the enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment, including the right to a clean environment, the right to access to environmental information, and the right to participate in environmental decision-making.

The court also granted the petitioner permission to file a petition seeking review of the impugned order and/or file an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. This means that the petitioner can challenge the court's decision if they believe that the court has erred in its judgment.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of the NGT in addressing environmental concerns and protecting the rights of citizens to a clean and healthy environment. The NGT provides a specialized forum for hearing and disposing of cases related to environmental issues, and citizens can approach the NGT to seek redressal of their grievances. Additionally, the court's decision also underscores the importance of the right to access to justice and the right to challenge decisions that are perceived to be unjust or unfair.
