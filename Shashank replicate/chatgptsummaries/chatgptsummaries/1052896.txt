The Supreme Court of India recently passed a judgment in a case related to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the constitution of the State Pollution Control Board in the State of Manipur. The case involved the appointment of a Chairman of the Board, allegations of abuse of power, and the removal of the Chairman from office. The judgment clarified certain aspects related to the appointment and tenure of the Chairman and the filling of vacancies in the Board.

The State of Manipur had adopted the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and constituted the State Pollution Control Board. The Chairman of the Board resigned, and the present respondent was appointed as Chairman until further orders. The Board was reconstituted, and the respondent was shown as Chairman until further orders. The Governor restricted the respondent's office of Chairman to a period of three years from the date of his initial nomination. The respondent's tenure as Chairman met with allegations of abuse of power, and he was removed from office.

The High Court allowed the respondent's writ petition, and he continued to hold his office as Chairman until 15-10-1999. The appellants then filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, raising two grievances. The first grievance was related to the reconstitution of the Board every time a new member was inducted or a new Chairman was appointed. The second grievance was related to the tenure of the Chairman and whether it could go beyond the date of nomination.

The Supreme Court found that the first grievance raised by the appellants had become of academic interest, and the second contention was dismissed. The Court held that in case of any casual vacancy of any member of the Board, the successor nominee who fills up such vacancy will have only the unexpired period of office available in the light of the initial appointment of the original incumbent member vice whom he walks in to fill up the vacancy.

The court order states that in case of a vacancy in the Board, the successor nominee will only have the remaining period of the original member's tenure. The State authorities should not reconstitute the entire Board every time a new member is inducted or a new Chairman is appointed. The tenure of the Chairman cannot go beyond the date of nomination. The court allows the appeal and states that the authorities can fill the vacancy of the Chairman after a certain date. No costs are awarded.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's judgment in this case provides clarity on certain aspects related to the appointment and tenure of the Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board in Manipur. The judgment emphasizes that the successor nominee who fills up a vacancy in the Board will only have the remaining period of the original member's tenure. The State authorities should not reconstitute the entire Board every time a new member is inducted or a new Chairman is appointed. The tenure of the Chairman cannot go beyond the date of nomination.
