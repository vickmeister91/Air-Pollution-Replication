The case in question involves a petitioner named Piyush Goyal who sought the quashment of an order passed by the Sessions Court and an application seeking a stay over auction proceedings. Goyal is now registered with the State Biology Diversity Board and is under the regulations of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002.

During the proceedings, Goyal withdrew the petition with liberty to raise all grounds before the Competent Court of Law. The court granted this request, but also ordered that Goyal must keep renewing a bank guarantee of Rs.8 lac before the trial court until the trial is over. The fate of the product in question will be decided by the trial court.

Ultimately, the petition stands dismissed as withdrawn with liberty. This means that while Goyal's petition was dismissed, he is free to raise all of his grounds before a competent court of law in the future.

The reason for Goyal's petition was not explicitly stated in the court order summaries, but it is likely related to the regulations of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. This act is designed to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge, as well as to ensure equitable sharing of benefits arising from their use.

It is possible that Goyal was seeking to challenge the application of this act in his specific case, or to argue that the regulations were being unfairly applied to him. However, without more information it is difficult to say for certain.

Regardless of the specifics of Goyal's case, the court order summaries make it clear that he was not successful in his petition. While he was granted the liberty to raise his grounds before a competent court of law, the court also ordered him to renew a bank guarantee and left the fate of the product in question up to the trial court.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of understanding and complying with relevant regulations, particularly in industries that involve biological resources. It also underscores the need for individuals to seek competent legal counsel when facing legal challenges, in order to ensure the best possible outcome for their case.
