The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a significant judgment in a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the state government to declare forest land as protected forest. The petitioners also challenged the state government's notification declaring their mining leases as protected forest. The state government defended the provision and the notification, stating that they are necessary to protect the forest land and waste land from mining activities and to preserve the environment.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment. The court order discusses various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court emphasized the duty of the State and citizens to protect and improve the environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife. The court also highlighted the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court upheld the State's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area, stating that public interest and the interest of ecology, environment, health, safety, and composite culture cannot be compromised under private rights. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The judgment is significant as it upholds the State's power to declare forest land as protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area. The court's emphasis on the duty of the State and citizens to protect and improve the environment is also noteworthy. The court's decision is in line with the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle, which are essential for the protection and preservation of the environment.

The court's decision is also significant as it highlights the importance of balancing private rights with public interest and the interest of ecology, environment, health, safety, and composite culture. The court's decision is a reminder that private rights cannot be absolute and must be subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of the larger public good.

The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the mining industry in Rajasthan. The mining companies will now have to comply with the State's decision to declare forest land as protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area. The decision is also likely to have a positive impact on the environment, as it will help in the protection and preservation of forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's decision in the group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies against the State of Rajasthan and others is significant as it upholds the State's power to declare forest land as protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area.
