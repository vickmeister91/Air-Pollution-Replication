The Appellate Tribunal for Electricity in Chhattisgarh State Power Distribution Co. Ltd. vs Chhattisgarh State Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors. case dealt with two appeals against the same order passed by the State Commission. The issue was regarding the grant of captive status to all four units of 135 MW each of DCPP by the State Commission to Respondent No.2, resulting in the loss of revenue on account of non-recovery of cross subsidy surcharge by the Appellants from Respondent No.2 in respect of units 3 & 4 consisting of 135 MW each of DCPP. The Appellants argued that cross subsidy surcharge is leviable on all consumers for balancing the cost of supply between subsidizing.

The court order discusses an appeal regarding the levying of cross-subsidy surcharge on consumers for balancing the cost of supply between subsidizing and subsidized consumers of distribution licensees. The issue in question is whether all four units of a power plant should be considered captive or only the first two units. The appellants argue that the cross-subsidy surcharge has been wrongly denied, causing financial loss, and that the regulations require separate connectivity for each generating unit of a captive generating plant. The appellants allege that the respondent has violated legal provisions by supplying power from units 3 and 4 without obtaining connectivity as required. The court considers the arguments of both parties and provides detailed observations.

The court order pertains to a case where a captive user is required to identify the unit/units intended for captive consumption at the time of induction of equity stage itself. The court held that pre-identification of the unit/units is essential to prevent gaming and frustration of the purpose of law. The court also discussed the legal requirements for qualifying as a captive power plant. The respondent in the case claimed that it had fulfilled both the criteria of ownership of more than 26% and quantum of power of self-consumption not less than 51% as prescribed under the Electricity Act, 2003. The appellant alleged that the respondent was gaming with the ulterior motive of claiming undue benefit of exemption from payment of cross-subsidy surcharge. The court considered the arguments of both parties and made a decision.

The court order discusses the status of a captive power plant and its connection to the state grid. The respondent argues that there is no requirement for units 3 and 4 to be permanently disconnected from the CTU and that the relevant regulations allow for connectivity to both the STU and CTU. The respondent also argues that the twin test of ownership and captive consumption has been passed, and therefore, the plant should be considered a captive power plant. The State Commission defends its order, citing various documents submitted by the respondent, and argues that the plant was classified as a captive generating plant from its inception. The court also discusses the issue of safety violations and the payment of parallel operation charges.

The court order discusses the captive status of units 3 and 4 of a power plant owned by Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL). The State Commission has held that the power plant is maintaining captive status and therefore, cross-subsidy surcharge for the period under dispute will not be applicable. The court finds no ground to consider units 3 and 4 of the power plant not under captive status, even though JSPL has obtained open access to sell electricity in the market through the Central Transmission Utility network. The court also notes that all relevant documents submitted by JSPL have been perused by the State Commission while concluding the matter.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the captive status of a power plant and the levying of cross-subsidy surcharge. The petitioner argued that the power plant met the conditions for captive status, despite being connected to both the state transmission utility and the central transmission utility. The court found no merit in the appeals and upheld the state commission's order, dismissing the appeals and making no order as to costs.

In summary, the court orders discussed various appeals related to the captive status of power plants and the levying of cross-subsidy surcharge. The court considered the arguments of both parties and provided detailed observations. The court held that pre-identification of the unit/units intended for captive consumption is essential to prevent gaming and frustration of the purpose of law. The court also discussed the legal requirements for qualifying as a captive power plant and the issue of safety violations and the payment of parallel operation charges. The court found no ground to consider units 3 and 4 of the power plant not under captive status, even though the power plant had obtained open access to sell electricity in the market through the Central Transmission Utility network. The court dismissed some appeals and upheld the state commission's order in others.
