The court order pertains to the case of Kallu @ Bhan Singh, who has been in custody since January 23, 2015, for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant's counsel has requested bail, stating that the applicant is a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that the charge sheet has already been filed. The court has accepted the bail application and ordered the release of the applicant on a bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. The applicant must appear before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violation of this act is a serious offense, and the punishment can range from imprisonment to hefty fines. In the case of Kallu @ Bhan Singh, he was arrested for violating this act and has been in custody for over five years.

The applicant's counsel has requested bail, stating that the applicant is a reputed citizen with no criminal past. This is a common argument made by defense lawyers in bail applications. They try to establish that the accused is not a flight risk and will not abscond if released on bail. The fact that the charge sheet has already been filed is also a significant factor in favor of granting bail. It indicates that the investigation is complete, and there is no risk of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

The court has accepted the bail application and ordered the release of the applicant on a bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. A bond is a legal agreement between the accused and the court. The accused has to deposit a certain amount of money as security, which will be forfeited if they fail to appear in court or violate any of the conditions of the bond. The surety bond is a guarantee provided by a third party that the accused will comply with the conditions of the bond.

The applicant must appear before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court. This is a standard condition of bail. The accused has to attend all court hearings and cannot leave the jurisdiction without the court's permission. Failure to comply with this condition can result in the cancellation of bail and re-arrest of the accused.

The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective. Bail jump refers to the act of absconding or failing to appear in court after being released on bail. If the accused jumps bail, the court can issue a warrant for their arrest, and the bond amount will be forfeited. The fact that the court has explicitly mentioned this condition in the order indicates that they are aware of the risk of the accused absconding and want to deter them from doing so.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Kallu @ Bhan Singh, who has been in custody for over five years for violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has accepted the bail application and ordered the release of the applicant on a bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. The applicant must appear before the trial court on the dates given by the concerned court, and the order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective. This order is a significant development in the case and will allow the accused to defend themselves in court while awaiting trial.
