In a recent court order, Banarsi, who was accused of possessing a tiger skin, was granted bail by the court. The court based its decision on two main grounds. Firstly, there was no evidence to suggest that Banarsi had killed the tiger himself. Secondly, the maximum sentence for the offense was three years, which the court deemed to be a relatively minor offense.

The court also took into account the fact that Banarsi had been in jail since November 2009 and that the trial had not yet concluded. The court found it unfair to keep Banarsi in jail for such a long period without a verdict. Therefore, the court granted him bail.

The court also noted that there was no reason to believe that Banarsi would tamper with witnesses or abscond if released on bail. The court found no evidence to suggest that Banarsi posed a threat to society or that he was likely to flee the country. Therefore, the court granted him bail.

The decision to grant bail to Banarsi has been met with mixed reactions. Some people believe that the court has made the right decision, given the circumstances of the case. They argue that Banarsi has been in jail for a long time without a verdict and that it is unfair to keep him in jail any longer. They also point out that there is no evidence to suggest that Banarsi is a threat to society or that he is likely to flee the country.

However, others have criticized the decision to grant bail to Banarsi. They argue that the possession of a tiger skin is a serious offense and that it should not be taken lightly. They also point out that there is a risk that Banarsi may tamper with witnesses or abscond if released on bail.

Overall, the decision to grant bail to Banarsi is a controversial one. While some people believe that the court has made the right decision, others are critical of the decision. It remains to be seen how the case will progress and what the final verdict will be.
