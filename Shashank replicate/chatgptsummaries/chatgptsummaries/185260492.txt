The Kerala High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Prasanth A.V. challenging the proceedings of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests regarding the issue of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for bringing an elephant from Uttar Pradesh to Kerala. The court directed the Principal Chief Conservator to verify the genuineness of the ownership certificate and transport permit produced by the petitioner and issue a NOC if satisfied with the conditions referred to in the proviso to Section 48 of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The petitioner, Prasanth A.V., had sought permission to bring an elephant from Uttar Pradesh to Kerala for the purpose of conducting a temple festival. However, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests had denied the request, citing concerns about the welfare of the elephant and the possibility of illegal trafficking. The petitioner then filed a writ petition challenging the decision of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests.

The court order directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to verify the genuineness of the ownership certificate and transport permit produced by the petitioner. The genuineness of the certificates was to be verified by making a request with the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests in Uttar Pradesh, and a decision was to be taken within four weeks. If the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests is satisfied with the conditions referred to in the proviso to Section 48 of the Wild Life Protection Act, a NOC is to be issued.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that all necessary permits and certificates are in place before transporting animals. The Wild Life Protection Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and regulates their trade and transportation. The proviso to Section 48 of the Act lays down the conditions that must be satisfied before a NOC can be issued for the transportation of wild animals.

The court order also underscores the need to ensure the welfare of animals during transportation. The petitioner had argued that the elephant would be transported in a safe and humane manner and that all necessary precautions would be taken to ensure its welfare. The court order directs the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to satisfy himself that the conditions referred to in the proviso to Section 48 of the Wild Life Protection Act are met before issuing a NOC.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Kerala High Court in the writ petition filed by Prasanth A.V. highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring the welfare of animals during transportation. The court has directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to verify the genuineness of the ownership certificate and transport permit produced by the petitioner and issue a NOC if satisfied with the conditions referred to in the proviso to Section 48 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court order is significant as it underscores the need to protect wild animals and regulate their trade and transportation in accordance with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act.
