The court order in question pertains to two appeals against a judgment in two writ petitions filed challenging the government's refusal to permit the use of a road inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The government had cited a notification that declared a minimum space of 800 to 1000 square kilometers as the core or critical tiger habitat. The court ruled that the writ petitioners should not have approached the court seeking permission and should instead approach the proper forum to consider the matter on merits, including all aspects of the matter, including Section 38-V and Explanations (i) and (ii) to sub-section (4) thereto.

The Periyar Tiger Reserve is a protected area in the Indian state of Kerala, covering an area of 925 square kilometers. It is home to a variety of wildlife, including tigers, elephants, and leopards. The reserve is also an important source of water for the surrounding areas, as it is the catchment area for the Periyar River.

The dispute in this case arose when the government refused to permit the use of a road inside the reserve. The writ petitioners argued that the road was necessary for the transportation of goods and people, and that it had been in use for many years. They also argued that the government's decision was arbitrary and violated their fundamental rights.

The government, on the other hand, cited a notification issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2006, which declared a minimum space of 800 to 1000 square kilometers as the core or critical tiger habitat. The government argued that the road in question passed through this critical habitat and therefore could not be permitted.

The court, in its order, noted that the writ petitioners had approached the court seeking permission to use the road, rather than challenging the government's decision on its merits. The court held that the writ petitioners should have approached the proper forum to consider the matter on merits, including all aspects of the matter, including Section 38-V and Explanations (i) and (ii) to sub-section (4) thereto.

Section 38-V of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, deals with the declaration of critical wildlife habitats. It provides that the central government may, by notification, declare any area as a critical wildlife habitat if it is of national importance for the survival of any species of wildlife. The section also provides for the constitution of a committee to advise the government on the declaration of critical wildlife habitats.

Explanations (i) and (ii) to sub-section (4) of Section 38-V provide further details on the constitution of the committee and the procedure for declaring an area as a critical wildlife habitat. The explanations also provide for the preparation of a management plan for the critical wildlife habitat, which shall include measures for the conservation and management of wildlife and their habitats.

The court's order, therefore, makes it clear that the writ petitioners should have approached the proper forum to consider the matter on merits, including all aspects of the matter, including Section 38-V and Explanations (i) and (ii) to sub-section (4) thereto. The court's order does not, however, provide any guidance on what the proper forum would be in this case.

Overall, the court's order highlights the importance of following the proper legal procedures when challenging government decisions. It also underscores the need to consider all aspects of a matter, including relevant laws and regulations, before approaching the court for relief. In this case, the court has made it clear that the writ petitioners should have approached the proper forum to consider the matter on merits, rather than seeking permission from the court.
