The inhabitants of Mavelkot, a village in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, filed a case against the State of J&K regarding the operation of a unit in their area. The court has reviewed a supplementary affidavit and a consent order issued by the J&K State Pollution Control Board. The consent order permits the operation of the unit, but with certain conditions that must be followed, including adherence to environmental protection laws and self-monitoring.

The court has directed the Pollution Control Board to conduct inspections and submit a report on compliance before the next hearing on May 31, 2018. This order indicates that the court is taking the matter seriously and wants to ensure that the unit is operating in a manner that is safe for the environment and the people living in the area.

The fact that the court has reviewed a supplementary affidavit and a consent order suggests that there may have been previous legal proceedings related to this matter. It is possible that the inhabitants of Mavelkot have been fighting against the operation of the unit for some time, and this court order is a result of ongoing legal battles.

The consent order issued by the Pollution Control Board is significant because it allows the operation of the unit, albeit with conditions. This suggests that the Pollution Control Board has deemed the unit to be safe for operation, as long as certain measures are taken to protect the environment and the people living in the area.

The court's directive to the Pollution Control Board to conduct inspections and submit a compliance report before the next hearing is a clear indication that the court wants to ensure that the conditions set out in the consent order are being followed. This is a positive step towards ensuring that the unit is operating in a safe and responsible manner.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need to ensure that industrial units are operating in a manner that is safe for the environment and the people living in the area. The court's directive to the Pollution Control Board to conduct inspections and submit a compliance report is a positive step towards achieving this goal. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the next hearing will be, but this court order is a positive development in the ongoing legal battle between the inhabitants of Mavelkot and the State of J&K.
