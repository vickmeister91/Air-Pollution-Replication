The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving M/S. Cooperative Co. Ltd and the State of U.P. & Anr. The appellant, a limited company, had been running a distillery with a bottling plant in Saharanpur since 1910. In 1980, the appellant applied to the Commissioner of Excise, State of U.P., to establish a bottling warehouse in Ghaziabad to meet its requirement of supplying country-liquor to Delhi conveniently and economically. The appellant was granted permission to bottle country spirit under bond for exports in a bonded warehouse to be licensed for suitable premises to be indicated by the appellant at Ghaziabad.

However, the appellant faced difficulties in running its distillery and bottling warehouse at Saharanpur due to a property dispute and provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The government permitted the appellant to shift its distillery from Saharanpur to another suitable place, and subsequently, the appellant established a new distillery and bottling plant at Yusufpur, Tapari Road, Saharanpur.

The government then revoked the appellant's license to run a bottling plant at Sahibabad, district Ghaziabad, stating that it was only a temporary measure to facilitate the appellant's shift of its distillery and bottling plant from Saharanpur. The High Court dismissed the appellant's writ petition seeking to quash the government's order, and the Supreme Court heard arguments from both sides.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether a bottling plant in Sahibabad was granted a temporary permission or a permanent license. The court found that the permission was not temporary and was granted for a specific purpose. The court also stated that if the company had violated any laws or terms of the license, the state could take legal action, but the license could not be canceled on the grounds that it was temporary.

The appeal was allowed, and the previous order was set aside. The court has cancelled an order that was granted as a temporary measure, and the appeal has succeeded. The previous order from 16.11.1992 has been set aside, and there are no costs.
