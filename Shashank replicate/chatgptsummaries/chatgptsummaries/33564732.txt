The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by VVF (India) Pvt. Ltd. against the Regional Officer-Navi Mumbai Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The petitioner challenges an order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board on October 29, 2018, alleging that principles of natural justice were not followed. The respondents argue that an alternate statutory remedy is available to the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal. The court finds that the issues raised can be canvassed before the Tribunal and refuses to grant any ad-interim relief. The writ petition is disposed of, keeping all issues open.

The case revolves around an order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on October 29, 2018, which the petitioner, VVF (India) Pvt. Ltd., alleges was passed without following the principles of natural justice. The petitioner, therefore, filed a writ petition challenging the order and seeking relief from the court.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner had an alternate statutory remedy available to them, which was to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT is a specialized court that deals with environmental disputes and has the power to hear appeals against orders passed by the MPCB.

The court, after hearing both sides, found that the issues raised by the petitioner could be canvassed before the NGT and that the petitioner had an alternate statutory remedy available to them. The court, therefore, refused to grant any ad-interim relief to the petitioner and disposed of the writ petition, keeping all issues open.

The court's decision to refuse ad-interim relief means that the petitioner will not receive any immediate relief from the court. However, the court's decision to keep all issues open means that the petitioner can still pursue their case before the NGT and seek relief from that court.

The case highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice in administrative proceedings. Natural justice is a legal principle that requires decision-makers to act fairly and impartially when making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. Failure to follow the principles of natural justice can result in decisions being overturned by the courts.

The case also highlights the importance of having alternate statutory remedies available to individuals who feel that their rights have been violated. The NGT provides an avenue for individuals to seek relief from decisions made by the MPCB and other environmental authorities. This helps to ensure that decisions are made fairly and that individuals have access to justice.

In conclusion, the court's decision to refuse ad-interim relief to the petitioner and dispose of the writ petition, keeping all issues open, highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice in administrative proceedings and having alternate statutory remedies available to individuals who feel that their rights have been violated. The case also underscores the importance of the NGT in providing individuals with access to justice in environmental disputes.
