The court recently issued a rule against an order of the District Judge of Barisal, which had reversed an order of the Subordinate Judge of that place setting aside a sale under Order 21, Rule 90, Civil Procedure Code. The Subordinate Judge had set aside the sale due to suppression of sale processes and other material irregularities. However, the District Judge had dismissed the petitioner's application for setting aside the sale on the ground that there was no proof of service of notice on the decree-holder.

The court found that the District Judge's view was wrong and that he had no jurisdiction to dismiss the petitioner's application for setting aside the sale only on the ground that no notice was served on the decree-holder and auction-purchaser. The case was sent back to the learned Judge for an inquiry as to whether the decree-holder had any notice of the application, and, if he holds he had, he will hear the appeal on the merits.
