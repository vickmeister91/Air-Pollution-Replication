The Patna High Court has issued an order in connection with Mali P.S. Case No. 22 of 2018, which involves the theft of sand and five tractors loaded with sand. The accused, Rajesh Singh, has been directed to surrender before the court within six weeks from the date of the order. However, he will be released on provisional bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Aurangabad, subject to certain conditions.

The order specifies that Rajesh Singh must not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission. He must also cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings as and when required. In addition, he must not tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses in the case.

The court has taken a serious view of the theft of sand and tractors, which is a common problem in many parts of the country. The illegal mining and transportation of sand has been a major issue in Bihar, with many cases of theft and illegal transportation being reported in recent years. The court has therefore directed the police to take strict action against those involved in such activities.

The order also highlights the importance of protecting the environment and natural resources. The illegal mining and transportation of sand not only causes damage to the environment but also affects the livelihoods of many people who depend on these resources. The court has therefore emphasized the need for strict enforcement of laws and regulations to prevent such activities.

Overall, the order of the Patna High Court in the case of Rajesh Singh serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and protecting the environment and natural resources. The court has sent a strong message to those involved in illegal activities that they will be held accountable for their actions and that strict action will be taken against them.
