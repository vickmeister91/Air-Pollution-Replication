The Delhi High Court has issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by Gramin Uthan Avam Jankalyan in public interest regarding public health issues in village Kapashera in Delhi. The court had earlier issued directions to various authorities to take action against pollution and unhygienic living conditions in the area. The present petition seeks to relocate a proposed sewage treatment plant (STP) away from the village habitat of Kapashera, citing concerns of pollution and adverse impact on public health.

The court has allowed the petitioner to amend the petition and place material in support of the plea that setting up of an STP involves hazards of pollution for the inhabitants in the vicinity. The court has emphasized the need for improving the quality of life in Delhi and the importance of treatment of sewage for health and supply of pure water to citizens.

The court order states that the river Yamuna, which is the primary source of water supply, is heavily polluted due to the discharge of untreated sewage from eighteen drains, including the Najafgarh drain. The Najafgarh drain basin is the biggest polluter to the river. The court emphasizes the need for the urgent construction of sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Delhi to reduce pollution.

The court rejects the argument that the location of the proposed STP at Kapashera is not ideal and states that the choice of location is a matter of administrative discretion. The court also notes that experts have examined the location and found it appropriate. The court dismisses the writ petition and upholds the construction of the STP at Kapashera.
