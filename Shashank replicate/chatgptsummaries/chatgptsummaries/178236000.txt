The recent court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by Dhananjay and Shilpi Granite Exports respectively. Dhananjay's petition seeks to quash an order rejecting the renewal of a quarrying lease, while Shilpi Granite Exports' petition seeks a declaration that the property in question is not a deemed forest or a forest. The court heard arguments from both sides and discussed the concept of 'deemed forests'. The order does not provide a final decision on the matter.

The court order refers to a judgment from 1996 which states that the Forest Conservation Act must apply to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification. The court directs that prior approval from the Central Government is required for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. The court also directs State Governments to constitute Expert Committees to identify areas which are forests and file reports. The court quashes and sets aside impugned orders and directs concerned authorities to decide afresh on applications for quarrying license/lease or renewal thereof, considering whether the land is a forest or forest land as laid down in the 1996 judgment.

The court order states that if a land is classified as a "forest" or "forest land", lease or extension of lease cannot be granted without the consent of the Central Government. The court has not made any decision regarding the applicability of certain rules and has left it to the concerned authority to decide. The petitions have been allowed with no order as to costs.
