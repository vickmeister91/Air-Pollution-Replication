The court order pertains to a criminal appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case related to the discharge of effluent water without purification. The prosecution had failed to follow mandatory provisions of the Act and Rules, and the trial court had found that the prosecution had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The appellate court found no reason to interfere with the trial court's findings and dismissed the appeal.

The case in question involved the discharge of effluent water without purification, which is a violation of environmental laws. The prosecution had alleged that the accused had committed this offense and had charged them under relevant sections of the law. However, during the trial, it was found that the prosecution had not followed the mandatory provisions of the Act and Rules, which had resulted in a lack of evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The trial court had examined the evidence presented by the prosecution and had found it to be insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused. The court had noted that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the effluent water discharged by the accused was harmful to the environment or that it had caused any damage to the surrounding area. The court had also observed that the prosecution had not produced any witnesses to support their case.

The trial court had further noted that the accused had denied the charges against them and had produced evidence to show that they had taken steps to purify the effluent water before discharging it. The court had also observed that the accused had obtained the necessary permissions from the relevant authorities before discharging the effluent water.

Based on these findings, the trial court had acquitted the accused of all charges. The prosecution had then filed an appeal against this decision, arguing that the trial court had erred in its findings.

However, the appellate court found no reason to interfere with the trial court's decision. The court noted that the prosecution had failed to produce sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The court also observed that the trial court had examined the evidence presented by the prosecution and had arrived at a reasoned decision based on the facts of the case.

In light of these findings, the appellate court dismissed the appeal and upheld the trial court's decision to acquit the accused. The court's decision highlights the importance of following mandatory provisions of the law and rules while prosecuting cases. It also underscores the need for prosecutors to produce sufficient evidence to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.
