The Madras High Court recently issued a judgment in the case of V. Subramanian vs Ravikumar. The case involved a dispute over the starting of a stone crushing unit in a property adjacent to the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff alleged that the unit would create noise and dust, polluting the area and water. The defendants argued that the allegations were false and that they had obtained necessary permission to start the unit. 

After hearing both sides, the court found that the unit had already been put in operation and that the defendants had obtained necessary permission from the authorities. The court dismissed the plaintiff's suit, as there was no evidence of any violations or harm caused by the unit. The court order states that the defendants have been granted permission to run a stone crushing unit in a property and have complied with all legal formalities. 

The plaintiff's claim that the unit would cause pollution and harm to their property is found to be baseless as the authorities have given necessary permission and there is no evidence of pollution. The court dismisses the plaintiff's suit and the appeals against it. The order is sent to various authorities and the case is closed.

The judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and complying with legal formalities before starting any industrial unit. It also emphasizes the need for evidence to support any claims of harm or violations caused by such units. 

The court's decision to dismiss the plaintiff's suit is based on the fact that the defendants had obtained necessary permission from the authorities and there was no evidence of any harm caused by the unit. This decision is in line with the principle of natural justice, which requires that a person should not be punished or deprived of their rights without evidence of wrongdoing. 

The judgment also underscores the importance of environmental protection and the need to prevent pollution. The plaintiff's claim that the unit would cause pollution and harm to their property highlights the potential negative impact of industrial units on the environment and the need for strict regulations to prevent such harm. 

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's judgment in the case of V. Subramanian vs Ravikumar is a reminder of the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and complying with legal formalities before starting any industrial unit. It also emphasizes the need for evidence to support any claims of harm or violations caused by such units.
