The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Edakkachi Thambai, a 78-year-old lady belonging to the Scheduled Caste and an agricultural laborer residing at Pilicode Harijan Colony. The petitioner had earlier been assigned 3.5 acres of land under the settlement scheme of the Prime Minister, but the assignment was canceled in 1987. The petitioner had subsequently requested for alternate land, but her request was not considered. The court order details the petitioner's grievances and the actions taken by the respondents. The petitioner had approached the court seeking a writ of certiorari and mandamus.

The court order directs the issuance of a writ of certiorari to quash an illegal order and a writ of mandamus to assign land to the petitioner. The case involves a 78-year-old agricultural laborer who belongs to the Scheduled Caste and was assigned land in 1965, which was later canceled. The petitioner was never permitted to take possession of the land, and objections were raised by the State Revenue authorities. The court rejects the argument of delay and laches on the part of the petitioner and holds that the process for consideration of assignment of alternate land is still ongoing. The court also notes that the petitioner is not an affluent member of the landed class and had purchased four cents of land with financial assistance from the Block Panchayat.

The court order discusses the eligibility of a petitioner for the grant of land under statutory rules for the settlement of landless agricultural laborers. The court finds that the petitioner, who owns only four cents of land, is eligible for the grant of assignment of land under these rules. The court also notes that the grounds for rejection of the petitioner's application for land are irrelevant and untenable. The court further observes that encroachers who have trespassed into the lands assigned to persons like the petitioner have no right to be considered for alternate assignment of land. The court also mentions the role of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes in investigating and monitoring matters relating to the safeguards provided for the Scheduled Castes under the Constitution.

The court order requires the State to lay before the Legislature a memorandum explaining the action taken or proposed to be taken on recommendations relating to the State. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes has issued a proceeding requesting appropriate action to be taken to redress the grievances of the aggrieved SC Women. The court quashes the impugned order and remits the matter to the 1st and 3rd respondents for consideration afresh. The petitioner will be at liberty to submit any supplementary representation before respondents 1 and 3 in advance of her submissions. A just, fair and reasonable decision shall be taken by respondents 1 and 3 on the request of the petitioner for assignment of alternate land. Respondents 1 and 3 shall endeavor to take a final decision on the request of the petitioner as directed above without much delay. Final decision on the request of the petitioner for assignment of land as directed above shall be taken by respondents 1 and 3 within an outer time limit of six months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this judgment.
