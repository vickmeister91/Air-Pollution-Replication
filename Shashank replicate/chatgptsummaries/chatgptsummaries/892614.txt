The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.) by three applicants who are being prosecuted for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The applicants had requested that the complaint filed against them by the Law Officer of U.P. Pollution Control Board be quashed. However, the court rejected their arguments and ultimately dismissed their application.

The applicants had argued that they cannot be prosecuted as directors, that they have retired, and that they are old and suffering from ailments. However, the court rejected these arguments and held that the complaint against the applicants contained clear allegations that they were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company and that they could be prosecuted unless they proved that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commissioning of such offence.

The court also rejected the applicants' argument that no statement was recorded before issuing summonses and that no counter-affidavit was filed by the opposite parties. The court held that these were not valid grounds for quashing the complaint.

Furthermore, the court rejected the applicants' application for amendment, which sought to argue that the applicants had applied for consent and that the refusal of the application was without jurisdiction. The court held that the documents supplied by the applicants could not be analysed in proceedings under Section 482, Cr. P.C.

In summary, the court order upheld the complaint against the applicants and dismissed their application under Section 482, Cr. P.C. The court held that the applicants could be prosecuted unless they proved that the offence was committed without their knowledge or that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the commissioning of such offence. The court also held that the documents supplied by the applicants could not be analysed in proceedings under Section 482, Cr. P.C.
