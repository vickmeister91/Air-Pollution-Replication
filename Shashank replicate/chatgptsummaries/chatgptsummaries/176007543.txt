The State of Madhya Pradesh appealed against an order by the National Green Tribunal, Central Zonal Bench, Bhopal, which directed that motor vehicles not complying with the requirement of displaying a valid Pollution Control Certificate would suffer the consequence of suspension and/or revocation of the Registration Certificate of the vehicle, and would also not be provided with fuel by any dealer or petrol pump. The Supreme Court of India is considering whether the Tribunal had the authority to issue such a directive and whether a monetary deposit could be demanded to secure compliance of an order. The case involves concerns over pollution and the decline in air quality.

The court order defines terms related to air pollution and outlines the functions of the Central Board and State Boards in improving air quality and preventing pollution. The order also gives the government the power to issue directions and lay down standards for emission of pollutants from automobiles and other sources. Penalties are outlined for those who fail to comply with the provisions of the Environment Protection Act.

The court order outlines the punishments for failing to comply with the Environment Protection Act, including imprisonment and fines. It also states that government departments can be held responsible for offenses committed under the Act, and that legal proceedings cannot be taken against the government or its employees for actions taken in good faith. The order also discusses the Central Motor Vehicles Rules and the standards for emissions from motor vehicles, including the requirement for vehicles to carry a valid pollution control certificate.

The court order discusses the rules and consequences of non-compliance with pollution control regulations for motor vehicles. Rule 115(7) requires vehicles to carry a valid pollution control certificate after one year of registration, and Rule 116 empowers officers to direct vehicles for emission testing. Non-compliance can result in penalties and suspension of registration. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 establishes a tribunal to settle disputes related to environmental protection, and provides for relief, compensation, and restitution for victims of pollution and environmental damage. The tribunal is not bound by the usual civil procedure and evidence rules.

The court order discusses the powers and procedures of the National Green Tribunal, including its ability to regulate its own procedures and not be bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act. The Tribunal has the power to summon and examine witnesses, receive evidence on affidavits, issue commissions, and pass interim orders. The Tribunal must apply the principles of sustainable development, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle when making decisions. The Tribunal can order monetary compensation or relief for damage to the environment, and failure to comply with its orders can result in imprisonment or fines. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment and the enforcement of environmental laws. The Tribunal can direct the government to implement requirements for vehicles to possess and display valid PUC certificates, and failure to do so can result in penalties such as suspension of registration and imprisonment.

The court order states that driving a vehicle without a pollution PUC certificate can result in suspension of registration certificate, imprisonment, fine, disqualification for holding a license, and imprisonment or fine. The suspension of the certificate of registration is temporary until a certificate is produced certifying that the vehicle complies with the rules. The court emphasizes that strong measures must be taken to protect the environment, but in accordance with the law. The court also rules that the tribunal had no power to direct the state government to issue orders on dealers and petrol pumps not to supply fuel to vehicles without PUC certificates. The state government is ordered to strictly implement compliance with the rules and penalize those who contravene them. The court allows the appeals and sets aside the tribunal's orders to deposit Rs. 25 crores and to issue orders on dealers and petrol pumps.
