The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to two petitioners who were apprehending their arrest in connection with a case registered under various sections of the IPC, Forest Conservation Act, Indian Forest Act, Factory Act, Pollution Control Act, and Jharkhand Mines and Mineral Control Rules. The court directed the petitioners to surrender within four weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. They were also required to deposit Rs. 4,000 each in the court before their surrender. The deposition would not prejudice the case of the petitioners and would be subject to the final result of the case.

The case in question pertains to allegations of illegal mining and transportation of minerals from a forest area in Jharkhand. The petitioners, who are the owners of a stone crusher unit, were accused of carrying out illegal mining and transportation of minerals from the forest area without obtaining the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities concerned. The case was registered against them under various sections of the IPC, Forest Conservation Act, Indian Forest Act, Factory Act, Pollution Control Act, and Jharkhand Mines and Mineral Control Rules.

The petitioners had approached the High Court seeking anticipatory bail, apprehending their arrest in the case. They contended that they were innocent and had not committed any offence. They further submitted that they had obtained all the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities concerned for carrying out mining and transportation of minerals from the forest area. They also argued that they had been falsely implicated in the case due to political vendetta.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the High Court granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The court observed that the allegations against the petitioners were serious in nature and required a detailed investigation. However, it also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigating agency and had not absconded or tampered with the evidence. The court further observed that the petitioners had a good reputation in the society and were not likely to flee from justice. Therefore, the court deemed it fit to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions while granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners. The petitioners were directed to surrender within four weeks and furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. They were also required to deposit Rs. 4,000 each in the court before their surrender. The deposition would not prejudice the case of the petitioners and would be subject to the final result of the case. The court also directed the petitioners to cooperate with the investigating agency and not to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses in any manner.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioners in the case of illegal mining and transportation of minerals from a forest area in Jharkhand is a significant development. The court's decision to impose certain conditions while granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners is a welcome move as it ensures that the petitioners do not abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court's observation that the allegations against the petitioners are serious in nature and require a detailed investigation is also noteworthy. It is hoped that the investigating agency will conduct a fair and impartial investigation in the case and bring the guilty to justice.
