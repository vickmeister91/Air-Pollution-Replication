The Supreme Court of India recently heard appeals against a High Court order that directed the demolition of a hotel complex constructed on land acquired by Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd. The land was originally sold to Gustavo Renato da Cruz Pinto and M/s. Sociedade e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd. by Dr. Alvaro Remiojo Binto. Appellant No. 1, Fomento Resorts and Hotels Ltd., leased the land from appellant No. 2, M/s. Sociedade e Fomento Industries Pvt. Ltd., and applied for permission to construct a hotel complex near Vainguinim beach. The Gram Panchayat granted permission subject to the condition that public access to the beach must be maintained. During construction, appellant No. 1 applied to change the location of the footpath and parking area, which was not forwarded to the Town and Planning Department. The court ordered the demolition of the hotel complex and resumption of the land acquired on behalf of appellant No. 1.

The court order pertains to the acquisition of land for a hotel complex in Goa. The court directs the acquisition of two small plots of land for the lay-out plan of the hotel building and the construction of a first aid post and medical aid center. The court also recommends acquiring additional plots of land for the second phase of the hotel complex. The court order discusses an agreement signed between the developer and the government, which outlines the conditions for the use of the acquired land. The developer later applied for permission to extend the existing hotel building, which was granted subject to certain conditions.

The court order discusses a case involving the extension of a hotel building in Goa, India. The Eco Development Council (EDC) approved the project with the condition that a pedestrian path be constructed for public access to the beach. However, the hotel owners deviated from the approved plan and started construction without waiting for further approval. Several writ petitions were filed by concerned parties, including the Goa Foundation and a local resident, alleging violations of agreements and blocking public access to the beach. The court order details the responses and counter-arguments made by the hotel owners and government officials.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the construction of a hotel on a beach in Goa, India. The court found that the land was acquired for public purposes and that the hotel's construction violated the terms of the agreement. The court ordered the demolition of the hotel and the resumption of the land by the government. The court also ordered that public access to the beach be maintained without obstruction. The appellants argued that the acquisition was under a different section of the law and that the public access was not a valid claim. The court rejected these arguments and upheld its order.

The court order discusses several questions related to the acquisition of land for a hotel in Goa, including whether the land was acquired for a public purpose, whether public access to the beach through the land is required to be maintained, and whether the construction of the hotel building on a portion of the land is in violation of the acquisition agreement. The court also refers to a previous case regarding the acquisition of land for a private company and the interpretation of Sections 40 and 41 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The court order discusses the conditions under which land can be acquired for public purposes. The appropriate government must be satisfied that the acquisition is for the construction of buildings or works that will benefit the public, or for the provision of amenities for workmen employed by a company. An inquiry may be held to determine this. If the government is satisfied, the company must enter into an agreement with the government regarding the payment for the acquisition, transfer of land, and terms of use. The court also discusses the interpretation of the term "public purpose" and how it applies to the acquisition of land for private industries.

The court order discusses the acquisition of land for a tourism development project in Goa and whether public access to the beach was available before the acquisition. The court determines that the acquisition was made under Section 40(1)(aa) of the 1894 Act and that public access to the beach existed through survey No.803 before its acquisition. The court also discusses the requirements of Section 41 for agreements related to acquisitions for different purposes.

The court order discusses the issue of public access to a beach through survey numbers 792 and 803. The appellant filed an affidavit and plan prepared by a consulting engineer, which showed the existence of public pathways leading to the beach. The High Court relied on this evidence and held that public access to the beach cannot be doubted. The appellant argued that the admissions made in a previous suit regarding the existence of access to the beach should not be binding on them as the written statement was not verified by the concerned person on personal knowledge. However, the court found that the verification of the written statement was in conformity with Order VI Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the High Court rightly relied upon it. The court also rejected the appellant's attempt to confuse the existence of access to the beach with a different access running along a nallah.

The court order discusses the duty of the appellants to maintain public access to the beach without obstruction, as per Clause 4(ix) of the agreement. The public trust doctrine is also invoked, which mandates the government to protect natural resources for the benefit of the people and not permit their use for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court recognizes the importance of protecting
