The State of Bihar had demanded a sum of Rs. 2,44,600 from Khanna Construction for allegedly carrying out mining operations without prior approval of the Central Government. The demand was made under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. However, the court held that the Act does not contain any provision for payment of damages. The court also held that the respondent had no jurisdiction to demand compensation from Khanna Construction and quashed the notice with costs.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to conserve forests and wildlife, and not to provide for compensation for damages caused by mining operations. The Act provides for the prior approval of the Central Government for diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes, including mining operations. However, the Act does not provide for payment of damages in case of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act.

The court also noted that the demand for compensation was made by the respondent, who had no jurisdiction to do so. The respondent was not authorized to demand compensation from Khanna Construction under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court held that the respondent's action was illegal and quashed the notice with costs.

However, the court also noted that if the grant of renewal of mining lease in favour of Khanna Construction was illegal, the State of Bihar could take action against them. The court's decision was based on the fact that if the grant of renewal of mining lease was illegal, then Khanna Construction would be liable for damages caused by their mining operations.

In conclusion, the court held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, does not provide for payment of damages in case of non-compliance with its provisions. The court also held that the respondent had no jurisdiction to demand compensation from Khanna Construction and quashed the notice with costs. However, the court noted that if the grant of renewal of mining lease in favour of Khanna Construction was illegal, the State of Bihar could take action against them.
