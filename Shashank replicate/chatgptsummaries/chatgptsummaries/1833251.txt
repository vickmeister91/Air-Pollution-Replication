The Andhra High Court recently upheld a government order directing the A.P. Gunny Bags Merchants Association to shift their business from Maharajgunj to a safer place to avoid air and environmental pollution. The court rejected the association's argument that only a handful of traders caused pollution and that the order was a colorable exercise of power. The court also noted that the right to carry on business is subject to restrictions imposed by law and that the association's license could be canceled for creating a nuisance. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed traders to apply for a fresh license to carry on business in new and unused gunny bags.

The A.P. Gunny Bags Merchants Association had challenged the government order, which directed them to shift their business from Maharajgunj to a safer place to avoid air and environmental pollution. The association argued that only a handful of traders caused pollution and that the order was a colorable exercise of power. However, the court rejected these arguments and upheld the government order.

The court noted that the right to carry on business is subject to restrictions imposed by law. In this case, the government had the power to regulate the location of businesses to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The court also observed that the association's license could be canceled for creating a nuisance. Therefore, the government order directing the association to shift their business was a valid exercise of power.
