On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in response to multiple writ petitions (CWP Nos.) filed by individuals against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The petitions pertained to the issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners.

The court notes that while the facts of each case are different, the authorities have given concurrent findings that the petitioners are encroachers on government land. The petitioners rely on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicates that the government is contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court notes that some of the encroachers are proprietors of the village, while others are landless and homeless, and there is a category of small and marginalized landowners who have constructed small structures on government land.

The court refrains from expressing any views on the matter and leaves it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directs the state government to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involves more than one government department, and the authorities are directed to take a holistic view of the matter. The court clarifies that the decision will be subject to judicial review and until then, status quo shall be maintained.
