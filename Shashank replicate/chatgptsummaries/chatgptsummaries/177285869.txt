The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Mahavir Gurjar, who was arrested in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal sand. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicant, including cooperating with the investigation/trial, not committing a similar offence, and not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial. The order will remain operative subject to compliance with these conditions.

The illegal transportation of sand has become a major issue in many parts of India, including the Chambal region. The sand mafia, as they are commonly known, engage in the illegal mining and transportation of sand, which is then sold at exorbitant prices. This has led to environmental degradation, loss of revenue for the government, and even violence in some cases.

Mahavir Gurjar was arrested in connection with one such case of illegal transportation of Chambal sand. He filed a bail application before the court, which was allowed subject to certain conditions. The court directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with a solvent surety in the same amount. This is a common practice in bail applications, where the court requires the applicant to provide a financial guarantee that they will appear before the court as and when required.

In addition to the financial guarantee, the court also imposed certain conditions on the applicant. These conditions are aimed at ensuring that the applicant cooperates with the investigation/trial, does not commit a similar offence, and does not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial. Cooperation with the investigation/trial is crucial in ensuring that justice is served and the guilty are punished. Committing a similar offence would be a violation of the trust placed in the applicant by the court, and seeking unnecessary adjournments would delay the trial and cause inconvenience to the court and other parties involved.

The court order will remain operative subject to compliance with these conditions. This means that if the applicant fails to comply with any of these conditions, the court may revoke the bail and order the applicant to be taken into custody. Compliance with these conditions is therefore crucial for the applicant to remain out on bail.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Mahavir Gurjar, who was arrested in connection with the illegal transportation of Chambal sand. The court allowed the bail application subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a personal bond and cooperation with the investigation/trial. Compliance with these conditions is crucial for the applicant to remain out on bail. The illegal transportation of sand is a major issue in many parts of India, and it is important that the authorities take strict action against those involved in this illegal activity.
