Two court orders have been summarized here, both of which involve the Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board being sued for negligence resulting in the death of individuals due to electrocution from snapped live wires. In the first case, the family of the deceased sued the electricity board for compensation, but the trial court dismissed the suit. The family appealed, and the appellate court found that the burden of proof rested on the defendants to prove they had taken all necessary precautions to prevent such accidents, and they had failed to do so. The court also found that the lower court had erred in placing the burden of proof on the plaintiffs and drawing an adverse inference against them for not examining witnesses who were not present at the time of the accident. The court awarded compensation to the family.

In the second case, the court found the defendants negligent in failing to prevent the death of a pedestrian who came into contact with a live wire hanging from an electric pole. The court rejected the notion of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased and awarded compensation to the family of the deceased based on loss of dependency. The plaintiffs were awarded Rs. 2,05,000 in damages or compensation for the death of the deceased. The court also ordered the defendants to pay the court fees.

Both court orders highlight the importance of taking necessary precautions to prevent accidents and the burden of proof resting on the defendants to prove they have taken such precautions. The courts also emphasized the need for a fair and just trial, with the burden of proof not being placed on the plaintiffs and adverse inferences not being drawn against them for not examining witnesses who were not present at the time of the accident. The courts also recognized the loss of dependency suffered by the families of the deceased and awarded compensation accordingly.
