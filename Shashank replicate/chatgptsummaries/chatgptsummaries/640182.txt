The Gujarat High Court recently dismissed an appeal by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the dismissal of their complaint for want of prosecution. The original complaint was filed against Bhagwati Silk Mills for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court found that the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint due to the appellant's failure to serve summons and warrants and provide addresses for the accused after a 20-year delay. The appeal was dismissed, and bail bonds were cancelled.

The case dates back to 1999 when the Gujarat Pollution Control Board filed a complaint against Bhagwati Silk Mills for violating provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The complaint alleged that the company was discharging untreated effluent into the nearby river, which was causing pollution and harm to the environment. The case was initially heard by a magistrate court, which issued summons to the accused. However, the accused failed to appear before the court, and the case was adjourned several times.

In 2001, the case was transferred to the court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, who issued non-bailable warrants against the accused. However, the warrants could not be executed as the accused had not provided their addresses. The case was then transferred to the court of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, who issued fresh summons to the accused. However, the accused again failed to appear before the court, and the case was adjourned several times.

In 2019, the case was transferred to the court of the Judicial Magistrate First Class, who dismissed the complaint for want of prosecution. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board then filed an appeal against the dismissal of their complaint in the Gujarat High Court.

The Gujarat High Court, while dismissing the appeal, observed that the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint due to the appellant's failure to serve summons and warrants and provide addresses for the accused after a 20-year delay. The court noted that the accused had not appeared before the court despite several summons and warrants being issued against them. The court also observed that the appellant had not taken any steps to ensure that the accused appeared before the court.

The court further noted that the appellant had not provided any explanation for the delay in serving summons and warrants and providing addresses for the accused. The court observed that the appellant had failed to discharge its duty to ensure that the accused appeared before the court and that the delay had caused prejudice to the accused.

The court also cancelled the bail bonds furnished by the accused and directed them to surrender before the trial court. The court observed that the accused had not appeared before the court despite several summons and warrants being issued against them and that they had not provided their addresses to the court. The court noted that the accused had failed to cooperate with the court and that their conduct was not conducive to the fair and speedy trial of the case.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the dismissal of their complaint for want of prosecution. The court found that the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint due to the appellant's failure to serve summons and warrants and provide addresses for the accused after a 20-year delay. The court also cancelled the bail bonds furnished by the accused and directed them to surrender before the trial court. The case highlights the importance of timely and effective prosecution in environmental cases and the need for all parties to cooperate with the court to ensure a fair and speedy trial.
