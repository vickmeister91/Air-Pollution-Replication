The Orissa High Court recently heard two writ petitions challenging the actions of ING Vysya Bank Ltd. The petitioners claimed that the bank violated the principle of natural justice. The bank argued that the writ petitions were not maintainable, citing a judgment by the Hon'ble Apex court in the case of Federal Bank Ltd. vrs. Sagar Thomas and Others. The court examined the scope of Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the definition of 'State' within the meaning of Article 12 of the constitution of India and other public authorities. The court cited several cases and tests to determine whether a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government. The court decided to first decide the issue of maintainability before going into the factual aspect involved in the Federal Bank Ltd. case.

The court order discusses whether the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is considered a "State" under Article 12 of the Constitution. The court concludes that it is not a "State" and therefore a writ petition under Article 226 would not be maintainable against it for enforcement of fundamental and other rights. However, the court clarifies that the power of the High Court is not limited to the Government or authority which qualifies to be a "State" under Article 12 and can extend to any person or authority. The court also discusses previous cases where writ petitions were filed against private bodies or persons for enforcement of public duty.

The court order states that a writ of mandamus can only be issued if there is a public duty involved, whether statutory or otherwise. Private disputes do not qualify for a writ of mandamus. The court cites various cases to support this principle. The court also notes that the writ will not lie in cases of non-compliance or violation of any statutory provision by a private body unless there is a public law element involved. The court concludes that the writ is not maintainable in the case at hand as the dispute is entirely private and does not involve any public element.

The court order states that the writ petition filed by the petitioners is not maintainable under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution as the dispute raised by the petitioners is private in nature and there is no violation of any statutory provision. The court also mentions that the opposite party, a bank, is a public authority but the absence of any public element makes the writ not applicable. The writ petitions are dismissed, but the petitioners are given the liberty to search for another forum to address their grievances.
