The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission recently heard a complaint filed by Mohinder Singh Bajaj against Puma Realtors Pvt Ltd. Bajaj had paid a booking amount of Rs. 6,50,000 for a residential plot in their project, IREO Hamlet, and was allotted Plot No. 22. However, the Opposite Parties failed to develop the project as promised and did not offer possession of the plot within the stipulated time. Bajaj filed a complaint under Section 17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, claiming a refund of Rs. 47,79,115 along with interest, compensation, and litigation charges. The Opposite Parties denied the allegations and claimed that the project was fully developed and all necessary approvals were obtained. The Commission heard both parties and examined the evidence before making a decision.

The court heard the case and reviewed evidence, including affidavits and documents. The complainant had purchased a plot of land in a residential project and made payments according to a payment plan. The development work did not start until two years after the agreement was signed. The court considered whether the existence of an arbitration clause in the agreement meant that the consumer complaint could not be heard. The court cited previous cases and concluded that the Consumer Foras had jurisdiction to entertain the complaint, as the Consumer Protection Act provides an additional remedy for consumers and is not in derogation of any other law. The court also noted that referring the matter to arbitration would be costly and time-consuming for the consumer, defeating the purpose of the Act.

The court order pertains to a consumer complaint against a cooperative society for not delivering a residential plot within the agreed timeframe. The court rejected objections raised by the cooperative society, including that the complaint was not maintainable as the complainant had purchased the plot for investment purposes and that the consumer complaint was not maintainable as the complainant did not buy goods or hire services. The court held that the protection provided to consumers under the Consumer Protection Act is in addition to remedies available under any other statute, including consentient arbitration. The court also held that housing construction or building activity carried on by a private or statutory body constitutes a service within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act. The court further held that a clause of jurisdiction, by way of an agreement, between the parties, could not be made applicable to consumer complaints filed before the Consumer Foras, as the Foras are not the Courts.

The court order discusses two cases where agreements were made between parties excluding the jurisdiction of any other court/forum in case of disputes. The National Commission held that such a condition could not be given importance and the complaint could be filed where a part of the cause of action arose. The court also found that the Opposite Parties were deficient in providing basic facilities like roads, sewerage, drinking water, electricity, street lights, drainage, and indulged in unfair trade practice by offering a paper possession to the complainant without completing the basic amenities and obtaining necessary sanctions/approvals. The complainant is entitled to a refund of the entire amount deposited by him as the Opposite Parties committed a breach of their obligation in not offering possession of the plot within the stipulated time.

The court order states that the complainant is entitled to a refund of the deposited amount along with interest compounded quarterly at 12% from the respective dates of deposits. The complainant is also entitled to Rs. 1,00,000 as compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service, and unfair trade practices. The court also orders the Opposite Parties to pay the cost of litigation to the complainant. If the payment is not made within the stipulated period, the Opposite Parties shall be liable to pay the amount with interest.

In summary, the court orders discussed above pertain to consumer complaints against real estate developers and cooperative societies for not delivering residential plots within the agreed timeframe and failing to provide basic amenities. The courts have held that the Consumer Foras have jurisdiction to entertain such complaints, even if there is an arbitration clause in the agreement. The courts have also held that the protection provided to consumers under the Consumer Protection Act is in addition to remedies available under any other statute, including consentient arbitration. The courts have ordered the developers and cooperative societies to refund the deposited amount along with interest and pay compensation for mental agony, physical harassment, deficiency in rendering service, and unfair trade practices. The courts have also ordered the developers and cooperative societies to pay the cost of litigation to the complainants.
