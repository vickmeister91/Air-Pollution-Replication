The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard a case filed by M/s Khan Plastic Industry against the Punjab Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought to quash an order directing the closure of their unit and requested permission to run the industry. The petitioner claimed to have fulfilled all required conditions and obtained necessary permissions. However, the respondents alleged that the industry was located in a residential area and was causing pollution. 

The court examined the impugned order and found that the petitioner was required to obtain consent from the Pollution Control Board to operate and provide adequate waste water treatment facilities. The court also noted that complaints had been received regarding pollution caused by the industry. Ultimately, the court did not grant relief to the petitioner.

The court order states that a petitioner industry was granted consent to operate subject to certain conditions, but failed to submit permission from the competent authority regarding continuance at the existing site. The Member Secretary of the Board ordered the industry to shift its unit to another suitable site within six months, but when the industry failed to comply, the order was given to close the industry and dismantle and remove all outlets. The petition was dismissed as the authorities found no merit in it.

In the first case, M/s Khan Plastic Industry had sought relief from the court against an order issued by the Punjab Pollution Control Board directing the closure of their unit. The petitioner claimed to have fulfilled all required conditions and obtained necessary permissions, but the respondents alleged that the industry was located in a residential area and was causing pollution. The court examined the impugned order and found that the petitioner was required to obtain consent from the Pollution Control Board to operate and provide adequate waste water treatment facilities. The court also noted that complaints had been received regarding pollution caused by the industry. Ultimately, the court did not grant relief to the petitioner.

In the second case, the court order stated that a petitioner industry was granted consent to operate subject to certain conditions, but failed to submit permission from the competent authority regarding continuance at the existing site. The Member Secretary of the Board ordered the industry to shift its unit to another suitable site within six months, but when the industry failed to comply, the order was given to close the industry and dismantle and remove all outlets. The petition was dismissed as the authorities found no merit in it.

Both cases highlight the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and complying with conditions set by regulatory bodies. In the first case, the petitioner claimed to have fulfilled all required conditions and obtained necessary permissions, but the court found that they had not obtained consent from the Pollution Control Board to operate and provide adequate waste water treatment facilities. In the second case, the petitioner was granted consent to operate subject to certain conditions, but failed to comply with the order to shift the unit to another suitable site within six months.

The court's decision in both cases emphasizes the need for industries to comply with regulations and take necessary steps to prevent pollution. The court noted that complaints had been received regarding pollution caused by the industry in the first case, and in the second case, the industry was ordered to shift to another site due to concerns about pollution. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in these cases highlights the importance of obtaining necessary permissions and complying with conditions set by regulatory bodies. Industries must take necessary steps to prevent pollution and comply with regulations to avoid facing closure orders.
