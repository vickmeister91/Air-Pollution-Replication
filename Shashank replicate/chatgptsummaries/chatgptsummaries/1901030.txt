In a recent court order, the cognizance taken by the court in a case involving accused individuals charged with offences under the Wild Life Protection Act was challenged on the grounds that it was taken beyond the period of limitation and without condoning the delay. The petitioners argued that the cognizance taken was bad and should be quashed. 

After considering the arguments presented, the court found that the cognizance taken was indeed bad and quashed it. The matter was remitted to the court below for fresh consideration.
