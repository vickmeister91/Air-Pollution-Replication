The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The petitioner had challenged an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Forest Officer, Sub-Division Forest, Jhabua, which had ordered the confiscation of a vehicle owned by the petitioner. The petitioner had claimed that the confiscation proceedings were not conducted in accordance with the law and that he was not given an opportunity to present his evidence.

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the petitioner had not availed the remedies prescribed under Section 52A and 52B of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. These sections provide for an appeal against an order of confiscation passed by a forest officer. The court observed that the petitioner had not filed an appeal before the appropriate authority and had instead approached the court directly under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court noted that the powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are to be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of the court or where the ends of justice require intervention. The court found that the present case did not fall within the ambit of Section 482 and that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the Indian Forest Act.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition with liberty to the petitioner to file an appeal against the impugned order before the appropriate authority. The court also observed that the petitioner would be entitled to raise all the grounds and contentions that were raised before the court in the appeal before the appropriate authority.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of availing the remedies available under the law before approaching the court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court has reiterated that the powers under Section 482 are to be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear abuse of the process of the court or where the ends of justice require intervention. The order also emphasizes the need for litigants to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the court directly.
