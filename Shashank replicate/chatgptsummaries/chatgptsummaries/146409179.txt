The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar, who had been apprehending his arrest in connection with Crime No. 2421/18 registered at Forest Range Office, Banda, District Sagar against him and co-accused Karan for the offences punishable under Sections 9, 39, 50, 51 of the Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution had alleged that the applicant and co-accused passed electric current through the fence to ward off animals from entering the land, resulting in the death of a wild cow.

The court allowed the application and ordered the applicant to join the investigation immediately and cooperate with the investigating agency. The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar was based on the fact that he had no prior criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. The court also took into consideration the fact that the applicant had cooperated with the investigating agency during the course of the investigation.

The Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats, and to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products.

Section 9 of the Act provides for the prohibition of hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 provides for the power of the wildlife authorities to arrest without warrant any person who has committed an offence under the Act. Section 50 provides for the power of the wildlife authorities to enter and search any premises where they have reason to believe that an offence under the Act has been committed, while Section 51 provides for the power of the wildlife authorities to seize any vehicle, weapon, trap, or other equipment used for committing an offence under the Act.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Ashok Kumar is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for stringent penalties for offences committed under it, and the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the applicant does not in any way condone the alleged offence committed by him and co-accused Karan.

The court's decision to order the applicant to join the investigation immediately and cooperate with the investigating agency is also significant as it emphasizes the importance of cooperation between the accused and the investigating agency. The court's order ensures that the investigation is conducted in a fair and transparent manner, and that the accused is given an opportunity to present his case before the court.
