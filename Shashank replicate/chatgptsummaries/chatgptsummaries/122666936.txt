The court order pertains to two separate cases involving a dispute over possession of land. In the first case, the defendant had filed a suit for injunction against the plaintiff, which was dismissed along with the plaintiff's counterclaim. The plaintiff then filed another suit for possession, which was also dismissed. In the second case, the plaintiff claimed to have been dispossessed of land by the defendant. However, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove legal possession of the land in the previous case and that there was no cause of action for the present suit.

The court order discusses the principle of res judicata, which prevents parties from re-litigating matters that have already been decided in previous cases. The court found that the present suit was barred by the principle of res judicata, as the plaintiff had already filed a previous suit for possession that was dismissed. The court upheld the lower court's decision to dismiss the present suit, finding no substantial question of law.

The court's decision in both cases was based on the principle of res judicata, which is a fundamental principle of law that prevents parties from re-litigating matters that have already been decided in previous cases. This principle is based on the idea that once a matter has been decided by a court, it should not be re-litigated, as this would waste the court's time and resources and would be unfair to the parties involved.

In the first case, the court found that the plaintiff's second suit for possession was barred by the principle of res judicata, as the plaintiff had already filed a previous suit for possession that was dismissed. The court upheld the lower court's decision to dismiss the second suit, finding no substantial question of law.

In the second case, the court found that the plaintiff had failed to prove legal possession of the land in the previous case and that there was no cause of action for the present suit. The court also found that the present suit was barred by the principle of res judicata, as the plaintiff had already filed a previous suit for possession that was dismissed. The court upheld the lower court's decision to dismiss the present suit, finding no substantial question of law.

Overall, the court's decision in both cases was based on the principle of res judicata, which is a fundamental principle of law that prevents parties from re-litigating matters that have already been decided in previous cases. The court found that the present suit was barred by the principle of res judicata, as the plaintiff had already filed a previous suit for possession that was dismissed. The court upheld the lower court's decision to dismiss the present suit, finding no substantial question of law.
