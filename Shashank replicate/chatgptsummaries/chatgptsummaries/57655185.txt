The court order pertains to a case where a tanker carrying hazardous chemicals collided with a tipper lorry, resulting in the death of a person. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT), Puttur had passed a judgment and award in MVC.No.1657/1999 dated 17.10.2008, where the claim petition was allowed in part, and a compensation of Rs.3,11,732/- with interest at 6% p.a. was awarded. The liability was apportioned in the ratio of 50% on the Tipper Lorry and to the extent of 50% on the insurer of the hazardous chemical carried in the tanker. Two appeals were filed against this judgment and award, which were heard by the court.

The first appeal was filed by the insurance company, which argued that it cannot be called upon to indemnify the claim arising out of the accident as it had only insured the hazardous chemical being carried in the tanker. The court considered the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act and held that the insurer of the hazardous chemical was liable to indemnify the claim. The court also found that the accident was caused by the negligent driving of the tipper lorry driver and apportioned 50% of the liability to the insurer of the hazardous chemical carried in the tanker.

The second appeal was filed by the legal representatives of the deceased, who sought enhancement of compensation awarded by the MACT. The court found that the liability for the accident lies with the owner of the tipper lorry and their insurer, and not with the insurer of the hazardous chemical. The court ordered the compensation to be enhanced and directed the insurers to pay the same. The court awarded compensation to the deceased's legal representatives under various heads, including loss of dependency and conventional heads, and ordered interest to be paid from the date of filing the petition.

The court modified the award of the Tribunal by awarding interest to the claimants from the date of filing of the petition until the date of deposit of compensation awarded by the Tribunal. The court allowed MFA.No.609/2009 and set aside the judgment and award passed by the Tribunal in MVC.No.1657/1999, fixing 100% liability on the owner and insurer of the Tipper Lorry. The court also allowed MFA.No.4363/2009 in part, awarding additional compensation with interest to be deposited by the insurer of Tipper Lorry within four weeks. The amount in deposit in MFA.NO.609/2009 is ordered to be paid over to the appellant/insurance company.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where a tanker carrying hazardous chemicals collided with a tipper lorry, resulting in the death of a person. The court determined the liability of the insurers of both vehicles and the amount of compensation to be awarded. The court found that the accident was caused by the negligent driving of the tipper lorry driver and apportioned 50% of the liability to the insurer of the hazardous chemical carried in the tanker. The court also considered the provisions of the Public Liability Insurance Act and held that the insurer of the hazardous chemical was liable to indemnify the claim. The court ordered the compensation to be enhanced and directed the insurers to pay the same. The court modified the award of the Tribunal by awarding interest to the claimants from the date of filing of the petition until the date of deposit of compensation awarded by the Tribunal. The court allowed the appeals in part and set aside the judgment and award passed by the Tribunal, fixing 100% liability on the owner and insurer of the Tipper Lorry.
