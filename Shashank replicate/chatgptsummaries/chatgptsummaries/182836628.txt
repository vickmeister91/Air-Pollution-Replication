The Kerala State Pollution Control Board recently faced a writ petition filed by Kunju Moideen, who owns 65 cents of property in Eramalloor Village. Moideen had received a notice of intention of closure from the respondent under Sec.31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Sec.33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner sought an opportunity to be heard before the closure order was passed.

The court directed the petitioner to file an objection to the notice and directed the respondent to afford an opportunity of being heard on the objection before passing the closure order. This order is significant as it highlights the importance of due process and the right to be heard before any action is taken against an individual or entity.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 are two important pieces of legislation that aim to prevent and control pollution in India. These acts provide for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the acts.

Under these acts, the pollution control boards have the power to issue notices of intention of closure to industries or entities that are found to be violating the provisions of the acts. However, it is important to note that the right to be heard is a fundamental principle of natural justice and must be upheld in all cases.

In this case, the petitioner had sought an opportunity to be heard before the closure order was passed. The court, recognizing the importance of due process, directed the petitioner to file an objection to the notice and directed the respondent to afford an opportunity of being heard on the objection before passing the closure order.

This order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of due process and the right to be heard before any action is taken against an individual or entity. It also highlights the need for the pollution control boards to follow the principles of natural justice while enforcing the provisions of the acts.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the writ petition filed by Kunju Moideen against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board is an important reminder of the importance of due process and the right to be heard. It is a significant step towards ensuring that the principles of natural justice are upheld in all cases, and that the pollution control boards follow the provisions of the acts while enforcing them.
