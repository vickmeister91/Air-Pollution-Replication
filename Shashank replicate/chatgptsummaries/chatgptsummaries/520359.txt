The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by Ashok Foundries under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution to quash annexures 'J' and 'K'. Annexure-J informed the petitioner that operating its industries without the previous consent of the State Board under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1981 attracts penal provisions of Section 39 of the said Act. Annexure-K refused the consent of the Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 due to health hazards.

The Court stated that it cannot assume the role of a super-specialist and sit in judgment over the opinion given by a competent body like the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board-respondent No. 1. The Court further stated that the Board had conducted a detailed study and had come to the conclusion that the petitioner's industry was causing pollution and was a health hazard. The Court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the findings of the Board and had only challenged the legality of the annexures.

The Court observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. The Court also noted that the petitioner had not shown any error apparent on the face of the record or any violation of the principles of natural justice. The Court held that the annexures were valid and legal and dismissed the petition.

This judgment is significant as it upholds the powers of the State Pollution Control Board to regulate and control pollution caused by industries. The Court has also emphasized the importance of expert opinion and the need for the Court to defer to the opinion of competent bodies like the State Pollution Control Board.

In another case, the Delhi High Court recently directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to take action against thermal power plants that were not complying with the emission norms. The Court was hearing a petition filed by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) seeking directions to the CPCB to take action against thermal power plants that were not complying with the emission norms.

The Court noted that the CPCB had issued show-cause notices to the thermal power plants but had not taken any further action. The Court directed the CPCB to take action against the thermal power plants that were not complying with the emission norms and to submit a report to the Court within four weeks.

The Court also directed the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to consider the recommendations made by the CSE and to take appropriate action. The Court observed that the right to clean air was a fundamental right and that it was the duty of the State to ensure that the citizens enjoyed this right.

This judgment is significant as it emphasizes the importance of compliance with emission norms by thermal power plants. The Court has also directed the CPCB and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to take appropriate action to ensure compliance with the emission norms.

In yet another case, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) recently directed the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) to take action against industries that were polluting the Ganga river. The NGT was hearing a petition filed by the NGO, Social Action for Forest and Environment (SAFE), seeking directions to the UPPCB to take action against industries that were polluting the Ganga river.

The NGT noted that the UPPCB had not taken any action against the industries despite repeated complaints. The NGT directed the UPPCB to take action against the industries that were polluting the Ganga river and to submit a report to the NGT within four weeks.

The NGT also directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to monitor the water quality of the Ganga river and to submit a report to the NGT every month. The NGT observed that the pollution of the Ganga river was a matter of great concern and that it was the duty of the State to ensure that the river was kept clean.

This judgment is significant as it emphasizes the importance of protecting the Ganga river from pollution. The NGT has directed the UPPCB and the CPCB to take appropriate action to ensure that the Ganga river is kept clean. The judgment also highlights the need for the State to take proactive measures to protect the environment.
