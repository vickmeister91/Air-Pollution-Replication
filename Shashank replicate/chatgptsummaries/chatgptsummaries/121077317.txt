The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard an application filed by five residential colony societies seeking to address grievances regarding improper and unscientific operations at the Bhandewadi Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) dumping yard complex, resulting in serious air and water pollution and posing a serious health hazard to the population residing in the vicinity. The applicants claimed that the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and its contractor had not provided adequate machinery and plant for the purpose and were not operating the entire process of MSW management in a scientific manner, in compliance with the Municipal Solid Waste (M&H) Rules, 2000. The Respondent Nos. 3 and 4 had failed to provide a buffer zone, causing significant residential growth in areas surrounding the dumping yard, which ultimately resulted in exposing a large population directly to the air pollution and odour nuisance caused due to the dumping yard.

The court ordered the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to suggest improvements for solid waste management in the city, including developing disintegrated MSW facilities in different areas. The applicants requested that the court direct the respondents to restrict the present Bhandewadi Garbage Disposal Unit from polluting air and water in the vicinity, provide an alternate site for shifting the project beyond the city limit, and take preventive steps to save citizens from health hazards during the pendency of the petition. The respondents included the State Government, Town Planning department, Nagpur Improvement Trust, and Nagpur Municipal Corporation. The court received affidavits from each respondent, detailing their actions and compliance with regulations. The court also noted that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) issued notices and directions to the Corporation, which were duly complied with.

The court order discussed the pollution caused by the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) and sewage treatment at Bhandewadi in Nagpur. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and the operator had not complied with the MSW Rules, causing pollution. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had issued several notices and directions, but NMC had not complied. The MPCB had granted consent to operate the slaughterhouse at Bhandewadi with conditions, but untreated effluent containing blood was found to be discharged on the land. The court had identified issues related to pollution and the effectiveness of regulatory authorities in controlling it. The NMC had not adhered to the time limit for developing scientific MSW management facilities, and only 200 MT/D of MSW was being processed, causing pollution. The court had noted that the Respondent 2 and Respondent-7 were not operating the MSW processing and treatment plant in compliance with the MSW Rules and thereby causing pollution. The MPCB had issued directions to NMC in compliance with the comprehensive directions of the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay dated 2.4.2013 regarding MSW management in Maharashtra.

The court order outlined an action plan for managing solid waste in Maharashtra, including the identification of landfill sites and approval processes. The order also highlighted the neglected area of sewage treatment in urban development and the negative impacts of untreated sewage. The court found that the municipal authorities had violated waste management rules and failed to provide necessary sewage treatment and effluent treatment for slaughterhouses. The court also requested information on the environmental damage caused by non-compliance.

The court order discussed the lack of proper monitoring and management of a municipal solid waste (MSW) facility, sewage treatment plant (STP), and slaughterhouse in Nagpur, India. The court noted that the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) had not carried out adequate air and water quality monitoring, and that the operations of the facilities were causing environmental pollution. The court held the responsible parties liable for gross negligence and ordered them to restore the environment and pay environmental damages. The court also highlighted the importance of following MSW Rules and regulations for proper waste management.

The court order pertained to the mismanagement of municipal solid waste (MSW) in Nagpur, India. The court ordered the Secretary of Urban Development to review the MSW management status in Nagpur and prepare a specific action plan within four weeks. The court also ordered the MSW processing plant to be operational to its original capacity within sixteen weeks. The court directed the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra to investigate the mismanagement of MSW by the Respondent Corporation and take necessary action. The court also ordered the MPCB to conduct monthly monitoring as per MSW Rules and STP performance and submit reports to the Secretary of Urban Development and Collector, Nagpur. The Respondent Nos. 2 and 7 were ordered to deposit Rs. 20 lakhs each with the Collector, Nagpur, as environmental damages.

The court order required Respondent Nos. 2 and 7 to deposit Rs. 20 lakhs each as environmental damages for not operating the MSW processing plant to its capacity since February 2012. The money would be used for environmental programs in the localities in the vicinity of the MSW plant. If they failed to deposit the amount, the Collector of Rajkot would recover it by issuing a show cause notice and causing attachment of the property of the said Project Proponent. Respondent No. 2 was also required to install and operate an ETP for slaughterhouse within three months, or else MPCB may ensure closure directions for non-compliance.

In conclusion, the court orders highlighted the mismanagement of
