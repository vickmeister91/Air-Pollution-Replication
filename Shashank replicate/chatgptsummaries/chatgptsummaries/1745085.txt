The court order pertains to an appeal against a judgment and order passed in a Notice of Motion in a civil suit. The defendant had taken out a Notice of Motion raising a preliminary issue of jurisdiction, which was dismissed by a learned single judge. The defendant then filed an appeal against this order, which was also dismissed. The defendant then took out another Notice of Motion for an order rejecting the plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. The court rejected the plaint since the leave application under clause 12 of the Letters Patent was rejected.

The appellant sought leave from the court to file the suit under clause 12 of the Letters Patent. The court finds that the suit requires leave under clause 12, but the appellant did not apply for it when the suit was admitted. The court rejects the appellant's application for leave to file the suit under clause 12. The appellant's counsel argues that the plaint shall not be deemed to be duly instituted unless it complies with the requirements specified in Order IV Rule 1 of the CPC.

The court discusses the requirements for a suit to be deemed duly instituted and the relevance of sub-rule (1) and (2) in this regard. The learned counsel argues that the words "duly instituted" and "deemed to be" widen the scope of enquiry for granting leave under clause 12 of the Letters Patent. The counsel also relies on certain rules to support their argument that the suit was not instituted in accordance with the law. The court is asked to consider the application for leave under clause 12 since the suit is at the stage of lodging only.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether permission under clause 12 of the Letters Patent is required before instituting a suit. The appellant argues that suits without such permission are null and void, and that leave can be obtained at any time, even after the admission of the suit. The respondent argues that the appellant's reliance on Order IV Rule 1 is misplaced, as it only pertains to when a suit is instituted, and that compliance with clause 12 is necessary before admission. The court must consider the relevant provisions of the CPC and earlier case law to make a decision.

The court order states that sub-rules (1) and (2) of Rule 1 of Order IV must be complied with for a plaint to be deemed duly instituted. The deeming effect in sub-rule (3) of Rule 1 of Order IV only applies to non-compliance with Orders VI and VII, not clause 12 of the Letters Patent. The plaintiff intentionally pleaded a wrong jurisdiction to avoid clause 12 leave. Once a suit is admitted, leave under clause 12 cannot be obtained. The order cites several case laws in support of these contentions.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in receiving, trying, and determining civil suits. Clause 12 of the Letters Patent of Bombay states that the High Court can handle suits of every description if the cause of action has arisen wholly within the local limits of its ordinary original jurisdiction or if the defendant dwells or carries on business within those limits. However, the High Court cannot handle suits falling within the jurisdiction of the Small Cause Court at Bombay or the Bombay City Civil Court. The order clarifies that for suits related to land or immovable property situated within Bombay, the High Court has jurisdiction without the need for prior permission or leave to institute the suit. For other suits, the cause of action is taken into consideration to determine jurisdiction.

The court order states that for suits related to land or immovable property within the jurisdiction of the High Court, prior permission or leave is required to file a suit. However, for all other suits except those that can be entertained by Small Cause Court or Bombay City Civil Court, permission is not required. The jurisdiction of the High Court depends on whether the plaintiff has sought leave to file the suit. The court also discusses relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and the Original Side Rules regarding the filing of suits that require leave of the court. Rule 45 of the Original Side Rules deals with the procedure for filing a plaint that requires leave of the court.

The court order discusses the procedure for lodging and presenting a plaint in a court case. It states that the plaint must be presented before the Judge or court and not before any other officer, except in cases of special urgency. The order also clarifies that suits which require leave of the court under clause 12 of the Letters Patent must be presented before the Judge. The argument of the appellant is focused on sub-rule (3) of Rule 1 Order IV CPC, which states that the plaint shall not be deemed to be duly instituted unless it complies with the requirements specified in sub-rules (1) and (2) of Rule 1 Order IV.

The court order states that the plaintiff must present the plaint in duplicate and either to the court or an appointed officer. In this case, the plaintiff presented the plaint to the officer as directed by the Prothonotary & Senior Master. However, the plaintiff did not follow the special procedure required for plaints that require leave of the court. The court finds that the plaintiff did not comply with Order VI and VII of the CPC and the plaint shall not be deemed duly instituted unless it complies with the requirements specified in sub-rule (2).

The court order discusses the compliance of various orders and rules related to the presentation of a plaint. The plaintiff had
