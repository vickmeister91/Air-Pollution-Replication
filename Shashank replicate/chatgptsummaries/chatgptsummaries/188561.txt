The Madras High Court recently heard a case where the Directors of Addisoris Paints and Chemicals Ltd. filed a petition to quash a criminal case filed against them by the Government of Tamil Nadu for failing to carry out an award passed by the Industrial Tribunal. The Directors argued that the company should have been added as an accused and without the company, the criminal case filed against them is not maintainable. However, the court held that every Director, Manager, Secretary, agent or other officer or person concerned with the management of the company shall be deemed to be guilty for the offences committed by the company and they should prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge or consent. The court dismissed the petition and stated that the prosecution proceedings cannot be quashed on the ground that without impleading the company as an accused the Directors cannot be prosecuted.

The case in question pertains to a criminal case filed against the Directors of Addisoris Paints and Chemicals Ltd. by the Government of Tamil Nadu for failing to carry out an award passed by the Industrial Tribunal. The Directors filed a petition to quash the criminal case on the grounds that the company should have been added as an accused and without the company, the criminal case filed against them is not maintainable.

The court, however, held that every Director, Manager, Secretary, agent or other officer or person concerned with the management of the company shall be deemed to be guilty for the offences committed by the company and they should prove that the offence was committed without their knowledge or consent. The court dismissed the petition and stated that the prosecution proceedings cannot be quashed on the ground that without impleading the company as an accused the Directors cannot be prosecuted.

This decision by the Madras High Court is in line with the legal principle of 'vicarious liability', which holds that a person can be held responsible for the actions of another person or entity. In this case, the Directors of Addisoris Paints and Chemicals Ltd. were held responsible for the company's failure to carry out the award passed by the Industrial Tribunal.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of corporate governance and the need for Directors, Managers, Secretaries, agents or other officers or persons concerned with the management of the company to ensure that the company complies with all legal requirements and obligations.

It is important to note that the court's decision does not absolve the company of its responsibility in this matter. The company can still be held liable for its failure to carry out the award passed by the Industrial Tribunal. However, the court's decision does make it clear that the Directors of the company cannot escape liability by claiming that the company should have been added as an accused in the criminal case filed against them.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in this case reinforces the principle of vicarious liability and highlights the importance of corporate governance. It also serves as a reminder to Directors, Managers, Secretaries, agents or other officers or persons concerned with the management of the company to ensure that the company complies with all legal requirements and obligations.
