The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently granted bail to Vijay Singh and Santosh Singh, who had been in custody since 30 July 2019 for allegedly hunting a wild animal, a Cheetal, in violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court found that the mandatory provisions of the Act had not been complied with by the prosecution and that there was no previous criminal record of the petitioners. The court ordered the petitioners to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one solvent surety each of the same amount and to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and the prevention of their hunting, poaching, and trade. The Act has been enacted to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and to regulate the hunting and trade of wildlife and their products. The Act provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife and their habitats.

In this case, the petitioners were accused of hunting a Cheetal, which is a protected animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that the petitioners had violated the provisions of the Act by hunting the animal without obtaining the necessary permits and licenses. The petitioners were arrested and remanded to judicial custody.

The petitioners filed a bail application before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, seeking their release on bail. The court heard the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense and examined the evidence on record. The court found that the mandatory provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act had not been complied with by the prosecution, and that there was no previous criminal record of the petitioners.

The court observed that the prosecution had failed to produce any evidence to show that the petitioners had hunted the Cheetal without obtaining the necessary permits and licenses. The court also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had not tried to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

The court, therefore, granted bail to the petitioners, subject to certain conditions. The court ordered the petitioners to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one solvent surety each of the same amount. The court also directed the petitioners to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C., which requires them to attend the court on all the dates of hearing and not to leave the country without the permission of the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioners has been welcomed by their lawyers and supporters. They have argued that the petitioners were innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. They have also criticized the prosecution for failing to produce any evidence to support their case.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and obtaining the necessary permits and licenses before hunting or trading in wildlife and their products. It also underscores the need for the prosecution to produce sufficient evidence to support their case and to ensure that the accused are not falsely implicated in criminal cases.

In conclusion, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh's decision to grant bail to Vijay Singh and Santosh Singh in the case of alleged hunting of a Cheetal is a significant development. The court's decision has been based on the lack of evidence produced by the prosecution and the absence of any previous criminal record of the petitioners. The case highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and the need for the prosecution to produce sufficient evidence to support their case.
