The court order pertains to a criminal appeal in which the appellants challenged an order passed by a single judge of the Allahabad High Court. The judge had allowed a revision petition filed by respondent no. 2 without issuing notice to the appellants or other parties. The court discusses the principles of natural justice, which are ingrained into the conscience of man and are not codified canons. The first and foremost principle is the audialteram partem rule, which says that no one should be condemned unheard. The court emphasizes that adherence to principles of natural justice is of supreme importance when a quasi-judicial body determines disputes between parties or any administrative action involving civil consequences is in issue. The court also notes that the concept of natural justice has undergone a great deal of change in recent years and that even an administrative order that involves civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice.

The court order also discusses the principles of natural justice, which include the rules of "nemo judex in causa sua" (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). These principles are deeply rooted in tradition and conscience and are meant to prevent miscarriage of justice. The court sets aside an impugned order and remits the matter to the High Court to consider the matter afresh after issuance of notice to the respondents in the Criminal Revision Petition.
