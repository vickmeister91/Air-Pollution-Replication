In a recent criminal complaint case, the petitioner, Jagjit Singh Sethi, filed a petition for anticipatory bail under Section 438 Cr.P.C. The petitioner's counsel argued that the wrong address was given, and he was never served, resulting in him being declared a proclaimed offender. The court disposed of the petition with a direction to the petitioner to surrender in the trial court within seven days and apply for regular bail, which should be decided within ten days. The petitioner shall not be arrested until the decision of the regular bail.

The petitioner's plea for anticipatory bail was based on the grounds that he was falsely implicated in the criminal complaint case. The petitioner's counsel argued that the petitioner was not served with the summons, and the wrong address was given, which resulted in him being declared a proclaimed offender. The counsel further argued that the petitioner was willing to cooperate with the investigation and was not a flight risk.

The court considered the petitioner's arguments and observed that the petitioner was declared a proclaimed offender due to his failure to appear before the court. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to appear before the court and had not provided any explanation for his absence.

The court, therefore, disposed of the petition with a direction to the petitioner to surrender in the trial court within seven days and apply for regular bail. The court directed that the regular bail application should be decided within ten days of its filing. The court also directed that the petitioner shall not be arrested until the decision of the regular bail.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of appearing before the court and cooperating with the investigation. The court observed that the petitioner's failure to appear before the court and cooperate with the investigation had resulted in him being declared a proclaimed offender. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for individuals to provide accurate information and cooperate with the authorities during the investigation.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the criminal complaint case highlights the importance of appearing before the court and cooperating with the investigation. The court's direction to the petitioner to surrender in the trial court within seven days and apply for regular bail, which should be decided within ten days, is a significant step towards ensuring that justice is served.
