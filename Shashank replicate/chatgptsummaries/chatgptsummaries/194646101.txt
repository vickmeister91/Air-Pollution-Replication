The court order pertains to the case of Rais Ahmed, who had been in custody since May 10, 2015, for a forest crime registered under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant's counsel argued that he was a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that his presence was not required during the investigation. The court allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and directed the release of the applicant on bail on the furnishing of a bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.

The case of Rais Ahmed had been ongoing for several years, and he had been in custody for over five years. The charges against him were related to a forest crime, and he had been booked under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act. His counsel argued that he was a reputed citizen with no criminal past and that his presence was not required during the investigation. The court considered these arguments and allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C.

Section 439 of Cr.P.C. deals with the powers of the High Court or a Court of Session regarding bail. It states that a person who has been arrested or detained in custody may be released on bail if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offense for which he has been charged and that he is not likely to commit any offense while on bail.

In the case of Rais Ahmed, the court was satisfied that he was not likely to commit any offense while on bail and that his presence was not required during the investigation. The court, therefore, directed the release of the applicant on bail on the furnishing of a bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety bond of the same amount.

The court order stated that the bail would be effective until the end of the trial. However, in case of bail jump, the order would become ineffective. This means that if Rais Ahmed fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of his bail, the court may cancel his bail and order him to be taken into custody again.

The order also highlights the importance of furnishing a bond and a surety bond. A bond is a written agreement between the accused and the court, in which the accused promises to appear in court as and when required. A surety bond, on the other hand, is a written agreement between the surety and the court, in which the surety promises to pay a certain amount of money if the accused fails to appear in court.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Rais Ahmed directs his release on bail on the furnishing of a bond of Rs. 30,000 with one surety bond of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective. The order highlights the importance of furnishing a bond and a surety bond and the powers of the court under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. regarding bail.
