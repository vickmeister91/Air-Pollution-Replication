The National Green Tribunal in Chennai recently heard an application challenging an order of the Appellate Authority under Water and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Acts of Andhra Pradesh. The order in question had set aside an Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board order to stop all activities in the premises of Visaka Industries Ltd. and shift to an alternate place. The Board had challenged the order, arguing that the industry was polluting and should be relocated. The court heard arguments from both sides and looked into all relevant documents before making a determination.

In another court order, an appeal by an industry seeking consent to operate was discussed. The Board had initially denied the industry's request due to its classification as a polluting industry. However, the Appellate Authority set aside the Board's decision and remitted the matter back to the Board for further consideration. The Board argued that the industry was located within 10 km of lakes and therefore needed to be relocated, citing government policy and a Supreme Court directive. The industry countered that it was adhering to pollution control norms and had not caused any harm. The court ultimately found that the Board had not provided sufficient evidence to support its claims and upheld the Appellate Authority's decision.

The third court order discussed an inspection of an industry that uses asbestos fiber, cement, fly ash, cotton rock pulp, and hard ground waste as raw materials. The industry generates process and domestic waste water, which is treated and recycled. The court ordered the industry to stop all activities in its current location and shift to an alternate site by a certain date. However, a later inspection showed that the industry was adhering to pollution control norms and recycling all water used in the process. The industry had also provided treatment facilities and recycling facilities for waste water.

Finally, the court order stated that during an inspection of an industry, it was found that the industry was not a water polluting or pollution potential industry. The industry had provided facilities for treating waste water and reusing it for gardening, as well as recycling waste asbestos cement sheets and using them in the manufacturing process. The court found that the industry did not need to be stopped or relocated as it did not pose a pollution threat to the nearby lakes. The application was dismissed with no cost.

In all of these court orders, the issue of pollution control and the impact of industries on the environment were at the forefront. The courts had to balance the need for economic development and job creation with the need to protect the environment and public health. In some cases, the courts found that industries were adhering to pollution control norms and were not causing harm, while in others, the courts ordered industries to relocate or stop activities due to pollution concerns.

It is clear that the issue of pollution control and environmental protection is a complex one that requires careful consideration and balancing of competing interests. The courts play an important role in ensuring that industries adhere to pollution control norms and that the environment is protected for future generations.
