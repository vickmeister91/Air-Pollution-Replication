In a recent court case, the petitioners filed a petition challenging the dismissal of their application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The application was for the production of an authority letter dated 15.9.1997, which was later destroyed. The prosecution denied the existence of the letter, and the trial court dismissed the application, stating that the prosecution had only relied on letters dated 4.9.1997 and 20.9.1997.

The petitioners argued that the authority letter was crucial to their defense and that its destruction was a violation of their rights. They claimed that the letter contained important information that would have helped them prove their innocence. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the letter never existed and that the petitioners were trying to create a false defense.

The court carefully considered both arguments and ultimately decided to dismiss the petition. The court held that the dismissal of the application would not cause any prejudice to the defense on its merits. The court reasoned that even if the authority letter had existed, it would not have changed the outcome of the case. The court noted that the prosecution had relied on other letters that were still available and that these letters contained similar information to the authority letter.

The court also noted that the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the authority letter had existed. The court stated that the burden of proof was on the petitioners to show that the letter had existed and that its destruction was a violation of their rights. The court found that the petitioners had failed to meet this burden and that their claim was therefore without merit.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition challenging the dismissal of the application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court held that the destruction of the authority letter, if it had existed, would not have caused any prejudice to the defense on its merits. The court also found that the petitioners had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim that the letter had existed. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in court and the burden of proof that rests on the parties making those claims.
