The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Bhagwan Das against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case originated from a PIL filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, which was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments on water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from the canal and its distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, the samples could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work. The State has come up with a long term plan to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments, but the court has asked for more details. The court has also directed the State to impose damages or compensation on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The case has been listed for further hearing.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals providing drinking water and the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removing encroachments situated on the water bodies. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose the number of encroachers who had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Sriganganagar, Superintendent of Police, Sriganganagar, Commissioner, Municipal Council, Sriganganagar, and the Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The State was also directed to issue notices to persons who were contributing to pollution and to file a compliance report.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court has also directed the Executive Engineer to convey the order to the District Collector. The court has suggested that the persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environmental issues. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that an appeal or revision is available if an inferior court or tribunal has committed an error that cannot be cured by other statutory remedies. However, if the inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or in a manner contrary to the rules of natural justice, the doctrine of alternative remedy may be ignored. In this case, the petitioner seeks a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court finds that the tribunal has ample power to condone the delay and that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is efficacious. Therefore, the writ petition is dismissed with the liberty to the petitioner to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until December 31, 2016.
