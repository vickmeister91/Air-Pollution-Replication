The court order pertains to a bail application filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner in this case is the first accused in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution has alleged that the accused persons were found in a suspicious manner and that two wild tortoises and two wild owls were found in the house of the first accused.

After hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense, the court has granted bail to the petitioner subject to certain conditions. The conditions include reporting to the investigating officer as and when required, not tampering with evidence, and cooperating with the investigation.

The court has taken into consideration various factors while granting bail to the petitioner. The court has observed that the petitioner has no criminal antecedents and that he has been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court has also taken into account the fact that the petitioner has cooperated with the investigation and has not been found to be involved in any other criminal activity.

The court has further observed that the allegations against the petitioner are not of a serious nature and that the prosecution has not been able to establish a prima facie case against him. The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the petitioner has a family to support and that his continued detention would cause undue hardship to his family.

The court has, therefore, granted bail to the petitioner subject to the conditions mentioned above. The court has also directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond and surety bond in a specified amount as a guarantee that he will comply with the conditions of bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to the petitioner in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has taken into consideration various factors while granting bail and has imposed certain conditions to ensure that the petitioner cooperates with the investigation and does not tamper with evidence. The court has also directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond and surety bond as a guarantee that he will comply with the conditions of bail.
