The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes between workers and their employers. In the first case, a worker claimed that his services were terminated illegally and that he was entitled to back wages and continuity of service. The management denied the allegations and stated that the unit had been closed due to directions from the Supreme Court of India. The court examined the evidence and found that the worker had not abandoned his job and was entitled to reinstatement with full back wages and continuity of service. The court also discussed the legal definition of abandonment of service and the circumstances under which it can be inferred.

In the second case, an employee's services were terminated by the employer, who claimed that the employee had voluntarily abandoned their duties. However, the court found that the employer had failed to prove this claim and had terminated the employee's services without proper justification. The court also emphasized the importance of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial inquiries, stating that it must be fair and just for both parties involved.

The third court order, LLR-538, discusses the disadvantage that employees face compared to employers and the importance of conducting an inquiry when a worker leaves after working for a year or more. The court cites Section 2(oo) and Section 25F of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947, which provide conditions for retrenchment of workers. The management did not conduct an inquiry and did not prove that it was not reasonably practicable to hold one, so the termination of the worker's services was illegal. The court then discusses the relief to be given to the worker, including back wages, compensation, and a sum of money to compensate for the financial loss caused by the termination. The court also notes that the worker did not prove that he was unemployed and did not make sufficient efforts to secure alternate employment.

Finally, the fourth court order is an announcement that an award has been dictated and will be sent to the appropriate government for publication. The file will be consigned to the record room.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures when terminating an employee's services and the need for employers to conduct inquiries before taking such actions. They also emphasize the importance of natural justice and fairness in administrative and quasi-judicial inquiries. In cases where workers are found to have been terminated illegally, the court may order relief in the form of back wages, compensation, and other forms of financial assistance.
