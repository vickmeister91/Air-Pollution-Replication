The National Green Tribunal recently heard an application challenging orders passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate under the Madhya Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam and Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules. The applicant, Mahakoushal Shaheed Smarak Trust, argued that it cannot be held liable for noise pollution caused by third-party licensees. The respondents argued that the applicant, as the owner of the premises, has control over the land and is therefore responsible for preventing noise pollution. The Tribunal considered the provisions of the Adhiniyam and Rules and ultimately held that the applicant can be held responsible under vicarious liability principles.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam, 1985 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, both of which aim to prevent noise pollution. The court notes that while the Adhiniyam is specific to noise pollution, the Environment Act deals with larger environmental issues. The court also discusses the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which specify regulatory measures for noise pollution. The court concludes that the Adhiniyam is intended to control noise pollution in Madhya Pradesh and provides various provisions for this purpose, including penalties for contravention. However, the court notes that the primary objective is to abate noise pollution, not to punish offenders.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal in relation to noise pollution and the liability of the licensor for the actions of the licensee. The court concludes that the licensor cannot escape liability for noise pollution just because they have let out their premises, but the primary responsibility lies with the licensee. The court also cites previous cases to support the fundamental right to sleep and peaceful protest.

The court order discusses the liability of a trust for the actions of its members during a yoga camp, where an indefinite fast was undertaken. The court held that while the trust is equally guilty, the emergency action taken by authorities cannot be considered malafide. The court also stated that Section 144 Cr.P.C. cannot be resorted to merely on imaginary grounds or threats. The court gave guidelines for conducting public meetings, dharnas, and agitations, and held that the trust cannot escape its obligation even if it has given a license to a third party. The court set aside an impugned notice issued by the authorities, stating that it was vague and could not be complied with. The court also directed the state government to notify silence zones for the entire state of Madhya Pradesh.

In summary, the court orders discussed the liability of individuals and organizations for noise pollution under the Madhya Pradesh Kolahal Niyantran Adhiniyam and Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules. The court held that the owner of the premises can be held responsible for noise pollution caused by third-party licensees under vicarious liability principles. The court also discussed the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal in relation to noise pollution and the liability of the licensor for the actions of the licensee.
