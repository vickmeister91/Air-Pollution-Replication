The recent court order pertains to a petition filed by M/s Taneja Developers and Infrastructure Ltd. and others seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The petitioners argued that they already had an Environment Clearance Certificate and therefore the complaint was invalid. The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings. The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case in 2011.

The case involved allegations of violation of environmental norms by M/s Taneja Developers and Infrastructure Ltd. and others. The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the petitioners under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The petitioners argued that they had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate from the concerned authorities and therefore the complaint was invalid.

The court examined the relevant provisions of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and the rules and regulations framed thereunder. The court noted that the purpose of the Act was to protect and improve the environment and to prevent and control environmental pollution. The court also noted that the Act provided for the grant of Environment Clearance Certificate to projects that were likely to have an impact on the environment.

The court observed that the petitioners had obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate from the concerned authorities before commencing their project. The court noted that the certificate was valid and had not been cancelled or revoked by the authorities. The court also noted that the certificate was issued after due consideration of the potential impact of the project on the environment.

The court held that the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was not maintainable in law. The court noted that the complaint was based on the allegation of violation of environmental norms, which had already been considered and addressed by the authorities while granting the Environment Clearance Certificate. The court held that the complaint was therefore invalid and liable to be quashed.

The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case in 2011. In that case, the court had held that once an Environment Clearance Certificate was granted, it was not open to the authorities to initiate proceedings under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 on the same grounds. The court had held that such proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law.

The court held that the present case was similar to the previous case and the principles laid down in the previous case were applicable to the present case as well. The court held that the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was an abuse of the process of law and liable to be quashed.

In conclusion, the recent court order quashing the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Taneja Developers and Infrastructure Ltd. and others is based on the principle that once an Environment Clearance Certificate is granted, it is not open to the authorities to initiate proceedings under the Environment Protection Act, 1986 on the same grounds. The court held that such proceedings would be an abuse of the process of law. The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case in 2011 and held that the principles laid down in that case were applicable to the present case as well. The court quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings.
