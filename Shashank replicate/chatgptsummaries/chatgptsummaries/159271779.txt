On December 7, 2016, Hon'ble Mrs. Justice Sneh Prashar of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh issued an order in relation to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petition sought to quash a complaint under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974.

During the proceedings, the counsel for the petitioners requested to withdraw the petition. The court allowed the withdrawal and dismissed the petition as withdrawn.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. This section is often invoked in cases where a complaint or FIR has been filed, but the accused seeks to have it quashed on the grounds that it is frivolous, vexatious, or malicious.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974 is a legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of central and state pollution control boards, as well as for the regulation of industries and other activities that may cause water pollution.

It is unclear from the court order what specific allegations were made in the complaint that the petition sought to quash. However, it is possible that the complaint related to an alleged violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974.

The fact that the petition was withdrawn suggests that the petitioners may have reached a settlement or agreement with the complainant or the authorities. Alternatively, they may have decided not to pursue the matter further for other reasons.

Overall, the court order is brief and provides limited information about the case. However, it highlights the importance of the inherent powers of the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in preventing abuse of the legal process and ensuring justice.
