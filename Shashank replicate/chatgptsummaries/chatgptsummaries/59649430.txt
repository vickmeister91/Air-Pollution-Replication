The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition that was filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). The petition sought to set aside an order that had been passed on an application filed by the Public Prosecutor under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. during the course of a trial.

The application in question had been filed by the prosecution in order to secure certain documents that were related to criminal cases that had been registered in various police stations. The prosecution claimed that these documents were necessary in order to prove the motive behind the commission of a murder that was being tried in court.

However, the court rejected the application, stating that the documents could be produced at a later stage and that certified copies could be secured. As a result, the petition that sought to set aside this order was also rejected.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows for the production of documents or other materials that are necessary for the purposes of an investigation or trial. This section empowers a court to issue an order requiring the production of such materials, and failure to comply with such an order can result in penalties.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of a High Court to make orders that are necessary to prevent abuse of the process of the court or to secure the ends of justice. This section allows a High Court to exercise its inherent powers to set aside orders that are illegal, improper, or unjust.

In this case, the court had rejected the application filed by the prosecution under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. on the grounds that the documents could be produced at a later stage and that certified copies could be secured. The court's decision was based on the fact that the prosecution had not demonstrated that the documents were necessary for the purposes of the trial.

The petition that sought to set aside this order was also rejected by the court. The court held that the order passed by it was not illegal, improper, or unjust, and therefore did not warrant interference by the High Court under its inherent powers.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of demonstrating the necessity of documents or other materials that are sought to be produced during the course of a trial. It also underscores the limitations of the inherent powers of a High Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. in setting aside orders that are not illegal, improper, or unjust.
