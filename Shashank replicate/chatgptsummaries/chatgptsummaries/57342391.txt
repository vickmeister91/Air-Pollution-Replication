The Delhi High Court recently passed an order in a case filed by Ajeet Kumar Jain, seeking the quashing of a criminal case filed against him in 2005. The petitioner had argued that charges had not been framed against him yet, and therefore, the case should be quashed. The trial court had cited the absence of a co-accused and delaying tactics adopted by the accused as reasons for the delay in framing charges.

The High Court, after hearing both parties, directed the trial court to separate the case of the absconding co-accused and make all efforts to conclude the trial against the remaining accused within one and a half years. The petitioner had given an undertaking not to seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial.

The case dates back to 2005 when a complaint was filed against the petitioner and his co-accused for cheating and forgery. The trial court had issued summons to both accused, but the co-accused did not appear before the court. The trial court then issued a non-bailable warrant against the co-accused, but he remained absconding.

The petitioner had argued that the trial court had failed to frame charges against him within the stipulated time, and therefore, the case should be quashed. However, the trial court had cited the absence of the co-accused and delaying tactics adopted by the accused as reasons for the delay.

The High Court, after hearing both parties, observed that the trial court had failed to take appropriate steps to ensure the presence of the co-accused. The High Court also noted that the petitioner had not sought any adjournments during the trial and had cooperated with the trial court.

The High Court directed the trial court to separate the case of the absconding co-accused and make all efforts to conclude the trial against the remaining accused within one and a half years. The High Court also directed the trial court to ensure that the petitioner is not prejudiced in any manner due to the absence of the co-accused.

The petitioner had given an undertaking not to seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial.
