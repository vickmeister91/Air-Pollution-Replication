The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) has been ordered by the court to allow Shree Narayani Minerals to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. The petitioner, Shree Narayani Minerals, had challenged the order passed by the JSPCB to close down their crushing unit. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without following the principles of natural justice and without complying with the procedure laid down under Section 21(4) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court granted an interim stay on the closure of the unit and directed the respondents to allow the petitioner to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. The court also directed the petitioner to implead the Union of India through the Ministry of Environment and Forest as respondent no.4 to the present petition.

The petitioner, however, argued that the order was passed without following the principles of natural justice and without complying with the procedure laid down under Section 21(4) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court, while granting an interim stay on the closure of the unit, observed that the petitioner had made out a prima facie case for the grant of interim relief. The court also noted that the petitioner had raised substantial questions of law that required consideration.
