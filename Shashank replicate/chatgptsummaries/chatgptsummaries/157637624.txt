In a recent court order, a petitioner who was accused of forest offences had a sum of Rs. 18,90,000 seized by forest officials. The petitioner filed an application to release the money, claiming that it was not involved in the forest offence and was raised by selling immovable property. However, the learned Magistrate refused to release the cash as proceedings to find out the source of the money had not been completed.

The petitioner then approached the court seeking the release of the seized amount. The court directed the petitioner to implead the Deputy Director of Income Tax (Investigation) and ordered the release of the amount to the petitioner on certain conditions. The conditions were that the petitioner must furnish a bank guarantee to the tune of 25% of the amount seized and property security for the rest of the amount.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided evidence that the seized amount was not involved in the forest offence and was raised by selling immovable property. The court also took into consideration the fact that the proceedings to find out the source of the money had not been completed and that the petitioner had a legitimate claim to the seized amount.

The court's decision to release the seized amount to the petitioner on certain conditions was a fair and just decision. The conditions imposed by the court were reasonable and ensured that the petitioner would not abscond with the seized amount. The bank guarantee and property security provided by the petitioner would act as a safeguard against any potential loss to the state.

In conclusion, the court's decision to release the seized amount to the petitioner on certain conditions was a just and fair decision. The court took into consideration the evidence provided by the petitioner and ensured that the state's interests were protected by imposing certain conditions on the release of the seized amount. The court's decision sets a precedent for future cases where seized amounts are involved and ensures that justice is served in a fair and just manner.
