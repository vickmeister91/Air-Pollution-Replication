The case in question involved a petitioner who sought a mandamus commanding the respondents to provide or accord permissions to extract minor forest produce (MFP) from forests predominantly for industrial activity. The petitioner had set up a Small Scale Industrial Unit that was entirely dependent on the MFP. However, a ban had been imposed on the extraction of MFP, which had already come to an end. 

The court found that the ban on the extraction of MFP had already come to an end due to the efflux of time and ceased to operate with effect from 21.07.2009. The issue raised by the petitioner was merely of academic interest, as in the absence of a sanction authorizing the petitioner to extract and transport MFP from demarcated forests during such a period, he could not claim infringement of any legal right, much less a constitutional right. As a result, the petition was dismissed.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permissions and sanctions before engaging in any activity that involves the use of natural resources. In this case, the petitioner had set up an industrial unit that was entirely dependent on the MFP, but had failed to obtain the necessary permissions and sanctions to extract and transport the MFP from demarcated forests. As a result, the petitioner was unable to claim any legal or constitutional right to extract and transport the MFP.

The court's decision also underscores the need for individuals and businesses to comply with environmental regulations and laws. The extraction of natural resources, such as MFP, can have a significant impact on the environment and local communities. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that such activities are carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner, with the necessary permissions and sanctions in place.

Overall, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary permissions and sanctions before engaging in any activity that involves the use of natural resources. Failure to do so can result in legal and constitutional challenges, as well as negative impacts on the environment and local communities.
