The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Section 51 of the Act deals with the punishment for contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder. The section provides for imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and also a fine of not less than ten thousand rupees.

Abdul Hamid Sheikh, the petitioner, was named in the charge-sheet in connection with a case under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. However, he claimed that he was not the person named in the charge-sheet. In such a scenario, the petitioner filed a petition under Section 438 of the CrPC seeking pre-arrest bail. Section 438 of the CrPC deals with the direction for grant of bail to a person apprehending arrest. The section provides that when any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section.

The court, after hearing the petitioner's plea, directed him to appear before the trial court within 15 days and raise the contention along with relevant documents. The trial court will then cause an inquiry to identify the accused through the Investigating Officer and proceed with the matter in accordance with the law. The petitioner shall not be taken into custody until the completion of such inquiry.

The court's direction is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that a person should be given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against him. The court has directed the petitioner to appear before the trial court and raise his contention along with relevant documents. The trial court will then cause an inquiry to identify the accused through the Investigating Officer and proceed with the matter in accordance with the law. This will ensure that the petitioner's rights are protected and that justice is done.

In conclusion, Abdul Hamid Sheikh, the petitioner, filed a petition under Section 438 of the CrPC seeking pre-arrest bail in connection with a case under Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The court directed the petitioner to appear before the trial court within 15 days and raise the contention along with relevant documents. The trial court will then cause an inquiry to identify the accused through the Investigating Officer and proceed with the matter in accordance with the law.
