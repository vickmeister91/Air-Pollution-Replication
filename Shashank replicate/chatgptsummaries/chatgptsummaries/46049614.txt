The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by the petitioners against the State of Chhattisgarh, the Collector of Mahasamund, and others. The petitioners had been granted lease of Survey No. 853/1, which was recorded as bade jhad ka jangal, by the Naib Tahsildar in 1981. However, the Collector set aside the order, and the State Government declared that the land allotted was bade jhad ka jangal and patta cannot be granted without prior approval from the Central Government. The petitioners challenged this order, but the court upheld the decision, stating that forest land cannot be allotted without prior approval from the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court order states that the term "forest" must be understood according to its dictionary meaning, and this covers all statutorily recognized forests, regardless of their designation or ownership. The term "forest land" includes any area recorded as forest in the government record, and prior approval from the central government is required for any diversion of forest land for other purposes. The court also affirms that no allotment or lease of forest land can be made without prior permission from the central government. 

The court dismisses the writ petitions and leaves the parties to bear their own costs. The Bade jhad ka jangal cannot be leased by the State or its authorities without prior approval of the Central Government under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The parties involved in the case are ordered to bear their own costs.

The court order is a significant development in the protection of forest land in India. The court has clarified that the term "forest" must be understood according to its dictionary meaning, which includes all statutorily recognized forests, regardless of their designation or ownership. This means that any area recorded as forest in the government record is considered forest land, and prior approval from the central government is required for any diversion of forest land for other purposes.

The court has also affirmed that no allotment or lease of forest land can be made without prior permission from the central government. This is a crucial step in protecting India's forests, which have been under threat from various activities such as mining, industrialization, and urbanization. The court's decision ensures that forest land is not diverted for other purposes without proper scrutiny and approval from the central government.

The court's decision is also significant in the context of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Act was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The court has clarified that the Act applies to all forest land, regardless of its designation or ownership. This means that any diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes must comply with the provisions of the Act, including obtaining prior approval from the central government.

The court's decision is a welcome development for environmentalists and conservationists who have been advocating for the protection of India's forests. The decision ensures that forest land is not diverted for other purposes without proper scrutiny and approval from the central government. It also strengthens the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which is a crucial tool in protecting India's forests.
