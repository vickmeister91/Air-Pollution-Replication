The court order in question pertains to an anticipatory bail application filed by Bhimashankar Kallappa Handral in connection with a case registered against him for illegal excavation and storage of sand. The court has granted him interim protection till the next date of hearing and has ordered his release on bail on executing a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two sureties in the same amount in case of his arrest. The next date of hearing is set for September 5, 2019.

The case against Handral is related to the illegal excavation and storage of sand, which is a serious environmental issue in many parts of India. The illegal sand mining industry is worth billions of rupees and has been linked to corruption, violence, and environmental degradation. The government has been cracking down on illegal sand mining in recent years, but the problem persists.

Handral's anticipatory bail application was filed in order to avoid arrest in connection with the case. The court has granted him interim protection till the next date of hearing, which means that he cannot be arrested in the meantime. However, he will have to appear in court on September 5, 2019, for the next hearing.

In order to secure his release on bail, Handral will have to execute a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two sureties in the same amount. This means that he will have to provide a written promise to appear in court when required and to comply with any other conditions that the court may impose. The sureties will also have to provide a similar promise and will be liable to pay the bail amount if Handral fails to appear in court.

The court's decision to grant Handral interim protection and release him on bail is a common practice in India's legal system. Anticipatory bail is a provision in the law that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of arrest. It is meant to protect individuals from arbitrary arrest and detention by the police. However, the grant of anticipatory bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the requirement to cooperate with the investigation and to appear in court when required.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Bhimashankar Kallappa Handral grants him interim protection and release on bail in connection with a case of illegal excavation and storage of sand. The next date of hearing is set for September 5, 2019, and Handral will have to execute a personal recognizance bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two sureties in the same amount in order to secure his release. The grant of anticipatory bail is a common practice in India's legal system, but it is subject to certain conditions. The case against Handral highlights the serious environmental issue of illegal sand mining in India and the government's efforts to crack down on it.
