The court order in question pertains to two bail applications filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for the grant of bail in connection with Crime No.113/2018 registered at Police Station Malazkhand District Balaghat for the offences punishable under Sections 9, 39, 44, 49B(1), 51 and 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first bail application was filed by the accused, who was charged with the illegal possession of wildlife products, while the second bail application was filed by the co-accused, who was charged with aiding and abetting the accused in the commission of the crime.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, dismissed the first bail application on the grounds that the accused had failed to make out a prima facie case for bail. The court observed that the accused had not been able to show that he was not guilty of the offences charged against him, and that there was a prima facie case against him. The court also noted that the accused had not been able to show that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence if released on bail.

The court also dismissed the second bail application on similar grounds. The court observed that the co-accused had failed to make out a prima facie case for bail, and that there was a prima facie case against him. The court also noted that the co-accused had not been able to show that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence if released on bail.

The court further observed that the third bail application filed by the accused was also liable to be dismissed as there was no substantial change in circumstances after the rejection of the earlier bail application. The court noted that the accused had not been able to show any new facts or circumstances that would warrant a reconsideration of the earlier order rejecting his bail application.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two bail applications filed under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for the grant of bail in connection with Crime No.113/2018 registered at Police Station Malazkhand District Balaghat for the offences punishable under Sections 9, 39, 44, 49B(1), 51 and 52 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court dismissed both the bail applications on the grounds that the accused and the co-accused had failed to make out a prima facie case for bail, and that there was a prima facie case against them. The court also observed that the third bail application filed by the accused was liable to be dismissed as there was no substantial change in circumstances after the rejection of the earlier bail application.
