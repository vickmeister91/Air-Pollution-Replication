In a recent court case, a petitioner filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking a direction to the District Collector to lay roads and install street lights in the interest of public health and safety. The petitioner argued that the lack of proper roads and street lights posed a threat to the safety of the public, especially during the night. The petitioner also claimed that the lack of infrastructure made it difficult for emergency services to reach the area in case of an emergency.

However, the District Forest Officer stated that forming roads in the reserved forest attracts the provision of Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The officer argued that the construction of roads in the reserved forest would have a negative impact on the environment and wildlife. The officer also stated that there was no proposal to lay a road in the area.

The court considered both arguments and ultimately dismissed the writ petition. The court noted that while the safety of the public was important, it could not be achieved at the cost of the environment and wildlife. The court also observed that the petitioner had not provided any alternative solutions to address the issue of safety.

The court's decision highlights the importance of balancing the needs of the public with the protection of the environment and wildlife. While it is important to ensure the safety of the public, it cannot be achieved at the cost of the environment. The court's decision also underscores the need for alternative solutions to address issues of safety and infrastructure in areas where traditional methods may not be feasible.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder that the protection of the environment and wildlife is a crucial consideration in any development project. It is important for policymakers and stakeholders to work together to find solutions that balance the needs of the public with the protection of the environment and wildlife.
