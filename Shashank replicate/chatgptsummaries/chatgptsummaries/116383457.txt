The case revolves around the requirement for petroleum dealers to obtain consent from the Pollution Control Board (PCB) to establish or operate petroleum outlets.

However, the court ruled that regardless of the relationship between the company and dealers, every dealer is bound to obtain consent to prevent pollution and protect the life of others.

The court also dismissed the argument that no pollution is caused by the operation of the petroleum outlet.

The court order gives the dealers three months to comply with the direction of PCB to obtain consent. Failure to comply with this direction could result in penalties or other legal action. The court order also makes it clear that no costs are awarded in this case.
