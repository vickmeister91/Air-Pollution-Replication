On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in Himachal Pradesh, India, which pertained to several writ petitions filed by individuals who were ordered to be evicted from government land. The court order listed multiple cases (CWP Nos.) with their respective petitioners and respondents. The cases involved individuals and their grievances against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India.

The court noted that while the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land. The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government in 2017, which indicated that the state was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court noted that some of the encroachers were proprietors of the village, while others were landless and homeless.

The court refrained from expressing any views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the court directed the state government to take a final decision within three months and maintain status quo until then. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and the authorities were directed to convene a meeting to take a holistic view of the matter. The court clarified that the decision taken by the state government would be subject to judicial review.

The issue of encroachment on government land by various categories of people, including landless and homeless individuals, small and marginalized landowners, and big landowners, was at the heart of the court order.

The court acknowledged that the state government had to balance the interests of various stakeholders, including the encroachers, the government, and the public at large.

The court order highlighted the need for a comprehensive policy on the regularization of encroachments on government land. The court noted that such a policy would have to take into account various factors, including the nature of the encroachment, the duration of the encroachment, the size of the encroached land, and the socio-economic status of the encroachers. The court emphasized that any policy decision taken by the state government would have to be based on a careful consideration of all these factors.

The court order also recognized the need for a participatory approach to the decision-making process. The court directed the state government to convene a meeting of all stakeholders, including the encroachers, to take a holistic view of the matter. The court emphasized that the views of all stakeholders would have to be taken into account while formulating the policy.
