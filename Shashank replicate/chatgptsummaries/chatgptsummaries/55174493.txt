The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M. Syed Ali against the Union of India, seeking a declaration that the provision "Renting of immovable property" as defined under Section 65 (90a) read with Section 65 (105) (zzzz) as 'Declared Service' under Section 66 E (a) read with 65 B (22) and bringing the said service under the definition of "Service" under Section 65 B (44) for the purpose of charging to Service Tax under Section 66 B of the Finance Act, 1994 and as amended by Finance Act, 2007 and Finance Act 2010, is illegal, ultra vires, beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament and unenforceable and liable to struck down as unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect.

The court dismissed the petition as a similar petition had been dismissed earlier and the matter had been referred to a larger bench. The court also noted that the order in the earlier case had not been stayed by the Supreme Court.

In the case of G.V.Matheswaran Vs. Union of India, the court order states that the provision has not been stayed by the Supreme Court and is upheld as of today. The respondents are allowed to act according to the existing provision, and the writ petition is dismissed without any costs. The order is addressed to various government officials and a copy is to be issued on April 15, 2019.

The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed against the Union of India. The first petition, filed by M. Syed Ali, sought a declaration that the provision "Renting of immovable property" as defined under Section 65 (90a) read with Section 65 (105) (zzzz) as 'Declared Service' under Section 66 E (a) read with 65 B (22) and bringing the said service under the definition of "Service" under Section 65 B (44) for the purpose of charging to Service Tax under Section 66 B of the Finance Act, 1994 and as amended by Finance Act, 2007 and Finance Act 2010, is illegal, ultra vires, beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament and unenforceable and liable to struck down as unconstitutional, null and void and of no effect.

The court dismissed the petition as a similar petition had been dismissed earlier and the matter had been referred to a larger bench. The court also noted that the order in the earlier case had not been stayed by the Supreme Court. This means that the provision in question remains in force and can be enforced by the government.

The second petition, filed by G.V.Matheswaran, challenged the same provision but on different grounds. The court order in this case states that the provision has not been stayed by the Supreme Court and is upheld as of today. The respondents are allowed to act according to the existing provision, and the writ petition is dismissed without any costs.

It is important to note that the provision in question relates to the taxation of renting of immovable property. The petitioners in both cases argued that the provision is unconstitutional and beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament. However, the court has upheld the provision and allowed the government to continue to tax renting of immovable property as a service.

The court order in both cases is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the taxation of renting of immovable property. The provision in question has been the subject of much debate and controversy, with some arguing that it is unfair and burdensome on property owners. However, the court has upheld the provision and allowed the government to continue to tax renting of immovable property as a service.

Overall, the court order in these cases is a significant development in the area of taxation law. It clarifies the legal position on the taxation of renting of immovable property and allows the government to continue to tax this activity as a service. While the petitioners may be disappointed with the outcome, the court's decision is likely to be welcomed by the government and other stakeholders in the real estate industry.
