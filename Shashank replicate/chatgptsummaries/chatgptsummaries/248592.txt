The court order pertains to three writ petitions filed against the laying of a road in Narikulam irrigation tank in Kanyakumari district, which could be detrimental to the ecology and environment. The court delinks one of the petitions and deals with the issue of whether the laying of the road can be permitted in public interest. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) claims that the tank land is government poramboke and required for the proposed 4-lane project of North-South Corridor. The petitioner, Conservation of Nature Trust, represented by its Chairman, Dr. R.S. Lal Mohan, claims that the tank is one of the biggest water bodies having a large water spread area to conserve water for one calendar year compared to other minor water bodies in the district and caters to the needs of three Panchayats comprising nearly 10 villages.

The court considers the arguments of both parties and makes a decision. The court emphasizes the importance of applying the precautionary principle to protect the environment, especially in cases where there is a threat of irreversible damage. The burden of proof should be on those proposing potentially harmful activities, and the polluter pays principle should be applied. The court also stresses the need to maintain natural resources and protect them from destruction.

In the specific case at hand, the court orders the NHAI to construct a full-length over bridge to prevent damage to the Narikulam Tank, a prominent water body, even if it involves higher costs. The court cites various principles laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the importance of environmental protection and the precautionary principle. The court ultimately decides that the road should not be constructed across the tank and instead directs the NHAI to construct an over bridge for the entire stretch of 530m to avoid any damage to the water body.

The Narikulam tank is a major source of irrigation and drinking water for several villages and is also important for maintaining the groundwater source in the area. The court cites a previous Supreme Court mandate empowering them to issue such directions in the interest of public and environmental protection. The NHAI is directed to construct a full-length over bridge for the 530 meters of the road to be laid over Narikulam Tank, investing a higher amount to save the water body from getting obliterated in the future. The NHAI is not permitted to lay the road across the Narikulam tank as planned and shown in Annexure 1 & 2, but need not resort to any alternate route.

The court has ordered that a 6 lane highway road can be built as scheduled, but the pillars must be laid inside the lake to prevent damage to the water body. The writ petitions are ordered with the above directions to the NHAI. The court's decision is a significant victory for environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources. The court's emphasis on the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. The court's decision also highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. The NHAI's willingness to invest a higher amount to save the water body from getting obliterated in the future is a positive step towards sustainable development.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the Narikulam tank case is a significant victory for environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources. The court's emphasis on the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. The court's decision also highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection. The NHAI's willingness to invest a higher amount to save the water body from getting obliterated in the future is a positive step towards sustainable development. The court's decision sets an important precedent for future cases involving environmental protection and the conservation of natural resources.
