The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to call for certain documents. The trial court had rejected the application, which was challenged by the petitioner. The court observed that while the powers of the court under Section 91 Cr.P.C. are wide, there are inherent checks and the court must consider the necessity and desirability of the documents sought to be produced.

The court found that the purpose of calling the documents had already been satisfied as the statements of the signatories of the documents were part of the police report submitted before the competent court. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition but allowed the petitioners to get the documents produced at any subsequent stage if required.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is wide in its scope and allows the court to call for any document or thing that it deems necessary or desirable.

However, the court must also consider the necessity and desirability of the documents sought to be produced. This means that the court must weigh the relevance and importance of the documents against the burden and inconvenience that their production may cause.

In the present case, the court found that the purpose of calling the documents had already been satisfied as the statements of the signatories of the documents were part of the police report submitted before the competent court. This means that the information contained in the documents had already been brought before the court and there was no need to call for the documents themselves.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition but allow the petitioners to get the documents produced at any subsequent stage if required is a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of both the petitioner and the court. The dismissal of the petition means that the burden and inconvenience of producing the documents at this stage have been avoided, while the allowance for their production at a later stage ensures that the interests of justice are not compromised.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of balancing the powers of the court under Section 91 Cr.P.C. with the necessity and desirability of the documents sought to be produced. While the section is wide in its scope, there are inherent checks that must be considered to ensure that the interests of justice are served.
