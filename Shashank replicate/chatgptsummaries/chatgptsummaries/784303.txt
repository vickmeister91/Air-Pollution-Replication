The Madras High Court recently issued an order in a case involving Midas Golden Distilleries Pvt. Ltd. and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had challenged an order issued by the Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which had closed the petitioner's unit with immediate effect. The court found that the order was issued without proper notice and opportunity for the petitioner to rectify any defects found during inspection. The court set aside the order and remitted the case to the Board for further inspection and corrective measures.

The court also prohibited the petitioner from increasing production beyond the permitted limit without permission from the competent authority. This order was issued to ensure that the petitioner complies with the environmental regulations and does not cause any harm to the environment.

The case was heard by Justice M. Sathyanarayanan, who observed that the order issued by the Board was arbitrary and violated the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the petitioner had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the order was issued, and that the Board had not provided any reasons for the closure of the unit.

The court also observed that the Board had not followed the proper procedure for inspection and had not given the petitioner an opportunity to rectify any defects found during the inspection. The court noted that the Board had not issued any show-cause notice or given any opportunity to the petitioner to explain its position.

The court, therefore, set aside the order and remitted the case to the Board for further inspection and corrective measures. The court directed the Board to follow the proper procedure for inspection and to give the petitioner an opportunity to rectify any defects found during the inspection.

The court also prohibited the petitioner from increasing production beyond the permitted limit without permission from the competent authority. This order was issued to ensure that the petitioner complies with the environmental regulations and does not cause any harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's order in the case involving Midas Golden Distilleries Pvt. Ltd. and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board is a significant development in the field of environmental law. The court's decision to set aside the Board's order and remit the case for further inspection and corrective measures is a welcome move, as it ensures that the principles of natural justice are upheld and that environmental regulations are complied with. The court's direction to the petitioner not to increase production beyond the permitted limit without permission from the competent authority is also a step in the right direction, as it ensures that the environment is protected from any harm that may be caused by the petitioner's activities.
