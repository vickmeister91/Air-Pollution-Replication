The court order pertains to the case of Theophilus vs State, where Theophilus was charged with offences under Sections 21 and 29 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, along with Section 14(a) of the Foreigners Act, 1946. The court acquitted Theophilus of the charges under the NDPS Act but convicted him for the offence under Section 14(a) of the Foreigners Act.

The case of Theophilus vs State is an interesting one, as it involves charges under two different acts - the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Foreigners Act. Theophilus was charged with offences under Sections 21 and 29 of the NDPS Act, which deal with the production, manufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transport, and consumption of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. He was also charged with an offence under Section 14(a) of the Foreigners Act, which deals with the entry, stay, and departure of foreigners in India.

The court acquitted Theophilus of the charges under the NDPS Act, which means that he was found not guilty of the offences related to narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. However, he was convicted for the offence under Section 14(a) of the Foreigners Act, which means that he was found guilty of violating the provisions related to the entry, stay, and departure of foreigners in India.

The court reduced his sentence from 5 years to the period he had already undergone in custody and ordered him to pay the fine imposed by the Trial Court. This means that Theophilus had already spent some time in custody, and the court decided to take that into account while deciding his sentence. The court also ordered him to pay the fine that had been imposed by the Trial Court, which is the court that had originally heard the case.

In addition to reducing his sentence and ordering him to pay the fine, the court also directed the Superintendant of the Tihar Jail to get in touch with FRRO or any other appropriate authority for his deportation or grant/extension of visa on payment of penalty. This means that Theophilus, who is a foreigner, will be deported from India or granted an extension of his visa on payment of a penalty. The court directed the Superintendant of the Tihar Jail to take the necessary steps to ensure that this happens.

It is not clear from the information provided what the penalty is or what the process for deportation or extension of visa involves. However, it is clear that the court has ordered Theophilus to pay a penalty and to leave India if he is not granted an extension of his visa.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Theophilus vs State involves charges under two different acts - the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and the Foreigners Act. Theophilus was acquitted of the charges under the NDPS Act but convicted for the offence under Section 14(a) of the Foreigners Act. The court reduced his sentence and ordered him to pay the fine imposed by the Trial Court. The court also directed the Superintendant of the Tihar Jail to get in touch with FRRO or any other appropriate authority for his deportation or grant/extension of visa on payment of penalty.
