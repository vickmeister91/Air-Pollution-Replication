The police had issued a notice under Section 91 Cr.P.C. calling upon the petitioners to furnish particulars about the woman or produce her before the police. However, the petitioners did not comply with the notice, and the court found that their objection to the notice was not maintainable as they were trying to stall the proceedings without cooperating with the police. As a result, the petition was dismissed.
