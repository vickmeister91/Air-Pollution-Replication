The court order pertains to two inter-connected writ petitions. The petitioner, a wholesale dealer in kerosene, applied for permission to shift his business to a part of plot No. 61 in Pragathi Nagar Colony. The Commissioner of Police and Controller of Explosives granted permission, but the Pragathi Nagar Colony Welfare Association filed a writ petition seeking a mandamus to prohibit the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad from issuing a license. The Welfare Association obtained interim orders, but the petitioner filed a petition to vacate the stay, which was granted. The Deputy Commissioner of Police issued a show-cause notice to the petitioner, and the no-objection certificate issued in his favor was canceled. The petitioner filed a statutory appeal, which was dismissed. The court held that the cancellation of the no-objection certificate was illegal and without jurisdiction. The court also held that the petitioner had not obtained a license as required under Rule 141 of the Petroleum Rules. The court dismissed one writ petition and allowed the other.
