The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a case where a petitioner sought to stop a tyre reconditioning unit from functioning due to environmental pollution caused by the unit. The Sub Divisional Magistrate had earlier passed a conditional order to stop the functioning of the unit, which was challenged by the respondents before the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court set aside the order and remitted the case back to the Sub Divisional Magistrate for fresh disposal after complying with the mandatory provisions of the Code. The petitioner challenged this order before the Kerala High Court.

The High Court observed that the burden of proof is on the respondents to show that the functioning of the unit does not cause any air pollution or nuisance, and the burden was wrongly cast on the petitioner. The court directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to dispose of the case afresh in accordance with the law expeditiously.

The case pertains to a tyre reconditioning unit that was allegedly causing environmental pollution. The petitioner had sought to stop the functioning of the unit, citing the adverse impact it was having on the environment. The Sub Divisional Magistrate had passed a conditional order to stop the functioning of the unit, subject to certain conditions being met. However, the respondents challenged this order before the Sessions Court, which set aside the order and remitted the case back to the Sub Divisional Magistrate for fresh disposal.

The petitioner then challenged this order before the Kerala High Court, which observed that the burden of proof is on the respondents to show that the functioning of the unit does not cause any air pollution or nuisance. The court held that the burden was wrongly cast on the petitioner, and directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to dispose of the case afresh in accordance with the law expeditiously.

The judgment is significant as it clarifies the burden of proof in cases where environmental pollution is alleged. The court has held that the burden of proof is on the respondents to show that their activities do not cause any air pollution or nuisance. This is in line with the principle of 'polluter pays', which holds that those who cause environmental damage should bear the cost of remediation.

The court has also directed the Sub Divisional Magistrate to dispose of the case afresh in accordance with the law expeditiously. This is important as environmental cases often involve complex issues and require a thorough examination of the evidence. The court's direction will ensure that the case is disposed of in a timely manner, without compromising on the quality of the decision.

Overall, the judgment is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. It clarifies the burden of proof in cases where environmental pollution is alleged, and ensures that such cases are disposed of in a timely and efficient manner. It is hoped that this judgment will serve as a precedent for future cases involving environmental pollution, and will help to protect the environment and the health of the people.
