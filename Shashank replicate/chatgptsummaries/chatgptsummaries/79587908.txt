The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Mangat Ram against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT issued various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal. The court also directed the State Pollution Control Board to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and its distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, due to ongoing maintenance work, water samples from the distributories could not be collected. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case. The State was warned of a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if they failed to submit the plans and action report. The District Collector was directed to be present on the next hearing date.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal, which were causing contamination of canal water. The state government was directed to file a compliance report. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the state's lethargic attitude and warned of appropriate action if the order was not implemented.

The court order discusses compliance reports related to encroachments on a water body and pollution of drinking water. The court orders the District Collector to appear before the tribunal and provide relevant information. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal for relief. The order cites legal precedents related to the availability of alternative remedies and the discretion of writ courts.

The court order states that a writ court can issue a certiorari even if an appeal or revision is available, if the inferior court or tribunal has committed an error that cannot be cured by other remedies. However, the court may still insist on using alternative remedies if they are effective. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and the petitioner could use the remedy provided under the Act of 2010. The writ petition was dismissed, but the petitioner was allowed to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT was expected to consider the delay caused by the writ petition and to sympathetically consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner.
