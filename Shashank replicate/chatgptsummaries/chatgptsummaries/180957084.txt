The Kerala High Court delivered a judgment on April 7, 2014, in a case filed by George Varghese against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash two documents issued by the third and fourth respondents and a declaration that he can maintain a go-down for storing gas cylinders without any consent from respondents 1 to 3. The petitioner alleged that the third respondent demanded a domestic gas cylinder illegally and threatened to close his godown. The second respondent filed a report on behalf of the first and second respondents, contending that it is the statutory duty of the Pollution Control Board to regulate and control the storage and handling of LPG.

The court order states that the petitioner approached the court regarding the storage of LPG and the need for obtaining consent from the Panchayat or Pollution Control Board. The second respondent filed a report stating that it is the petitioner's statutory obligation to obtain consent as he is carrying out a dangerous and offensive trade. The court notes that LPG storage falls under the Orange category industry and requires prior consent from the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner did not respond positively to notices issued to obtain consent and did not have a license from the local body.

The court permitted the petitioner to approach the Board and local authority with a proper application for consent and license. Until then, the existing state of affairs shall continue. The court also observed that the petitioner's godown is situated in a residential area, and the storage of LPG cylinders in such an area is hazardous. The court directed the Pollution Control Board to inspect the godown and submit a report on the safety measures taken by the petitioner.

The court further observed that the petitioner's godown is not a domestic connection, and the petitioner is carrying out a commercial activity. The court noted that the petitioner's godown is not registered under the Explosives Act, 1884, and the Petroleum Rules, 2002. The court directed the petitioner to obtain necessary licenses and registrations under the Explosives Act, 1884, and the Petroleum Rules, 2002, within three months from the date of the judgment.

The court also directed the local authority to ensure that the petitioner's godown is situated in a place that is not hazardous to the public. The court observed that the petitioner's godown is situated in a densely populated area, and the storage of LPG cylinders in such an area is hazardous. The court directed the local authority to ensure that the petitioner's godown is situated in a place that is not hazardous to the public.

In conclusion, the court ordered the petitioner to obtain necessary licenses and registrations under the Explosives Act, 1884, and the Petroleum Rules, 2002, within three months from the date of the judgment. The court permitted the petitioner to approach the Board and local authority with a proper application for consent and license. Until then, the existing state of affairs shall continue.
