The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by Satendra Kumar Sharma against the University Grant Commission (UGC) regarding the release of correct answer keys for question numbers 34 and 38 of the UGC-National Eligibility Test (NET) held in July 2016. The petitioner had raised objections to the answer keys provided by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and had paid Rs. 5000 for apprising the CBSE to correct the options. However, the CBSE rejected the objections of the petitioner.

The court has directed the UGC to modify the result of the petitioner and issue a revised marks-sheet. The court has also imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000/- payable to the petitioner, to be equally borne by the respondent no.1 and respondent no.2, for the harassment caused to the petitioner.

The petitioner had appeared for the UGC-NET exam in July 2016 and had raised objections to the answer keys provided by the CBSE for questions 34 and 38. The petitioner had paid Rs. 5000 for apprising the CBSE to correct the options. However, the CBSE rejected the objections of the petitioner and declared the result on 21st November 2017.

The petitioner then filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court challenging the decision of the CBSE. The petitioner contended that the answer keys provided by the CBSE were incorrect and that he had suffered a loss due to the same. The petitioner also contended that the CBSE had not followed the procedure laid down by the UGC for the conduct of the UGC-NET exam.

The court heard the arguments of both parties and observed that the CBSE had not followed the procedure laid down by the UGC for the conduct of the UGC-NET exam. The court also observed that the CBSE had not provided any reasons for rejecting the objections of the petitioner.

The court directed the UGC to modify the result of the petitioner and issue a revised marks-sheet. The court also imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000/- payable to the petitioner, to be equally borne by the respondent no.1 and respondent no.2, for the harassment caused to the petitioner.

The judgment of the Delhi High Court is significant as it upholds the rights of the candidates who appear for the UGC-NET exam. The court has directed the UGC to ensure that the procedure laid down by it for the conduct of the UGC-NET exam is followed by the CBSE. The court has also directed the CBSE to provide reasons for rejecting the objections of the candidates.

The judgment of the Delhi High Court is also significant as it imposes a cost on the respondents for the harassment caused to the petitioner. This will act as a deterrent for the respondents in future cases.

In conclusion, the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the writ petition filed by Satendra Kumar Sharma against the University Grant Commission (UGC) regarding the release of correct answer keys for question numbers 34 and 38 of the UGC-National Eligibility Test (NET) held in July 2016 is a significant one. The court has directed the UGC to modify the result of the petitioner and issue a revised marks-sheet. The court has also imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000/- payable to the petitioner, to be equally borne by the respondent no.1 and respondent no.2, for the harassment caused to the petitioner. The judgment upholds the rights of the candidates who appear for the UGC-NET exam and ensures that the procedure laid down by the UGC for the conduct of the UGC-NET exam is followed by the CBSE.
