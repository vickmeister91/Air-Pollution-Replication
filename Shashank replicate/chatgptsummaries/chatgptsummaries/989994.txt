The State of Madhya Pradesh filed a revision against the order of the Sessions Judge, Bhopal, which directed the release of a seized jeep to the respondent on furnishing security. The State argued that the amendment to Section 30 of the Wild Life Protection (Amendment) Act, 1991, which came into effect from 2-10-1991, makes any vehicle used for committing an offence and seized under the Act the property of the government. The power to return the vehicle has been taken away by the amendment to Section 50. The court allowed the revision and directed the jeep to be returned to the government.

The case involved the interpretation of the Wild Life Protection (Amendment) Act, 1991, and specifically the provisions relating to the seizure and forfeiture of vehicles used for committing offences under the Act. The State of Madhya Pradesh argued that the amendment to Section 30 of the Act made any vehicle used for committing an offence and seized under the Act the property of the government. The power to return the vehicle has been taken away by the amendment to Section 50.

The court agreed with the State's argument and allowed the revision. The court held that the amendment to Section 30 of the Act clearly states that any vehicle used for committing an offence and seized under the Act shall be the property of the government. The court also noted that the amendment to Section 50 of the Act takes away the power of the court to return the vehicle to the owner.

The court's decision in this case has important implications for the enforcement of the Wild Life Protection (Amendment) Act, 1991. The court's interpretation of the Act makes it clear that any vehicle used for committing an offence under the Act and seized by the authorities shall be the property of the government. This will make it easier for the authorities to seize and forfeit vehicles used for committing offences under the Act.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is an important one for the enforcement of the Wild Life Protection (Amendment) Act, 1991. The court's interpretation of the Act makes it clear that any vehicle used for committing an offence under the Act and seized by the authorities shall be the property of the government. This will make it easier for the authorities to seize and forfeit vehicles used for committing offences under the Act.
