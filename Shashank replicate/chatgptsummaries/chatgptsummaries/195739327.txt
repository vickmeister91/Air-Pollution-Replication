The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Suram Nath, who had been arrested in connection with an offence under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that the offence was triable by a magistrate and that the petitioner had been in custody for over a month with no other cases registered against him. The court, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, granted bail to the petitioner on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each and appear before the trial court on all dates of hearing.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 deals with penalties for offences under the Act. The offence that Suram Nath was charged with is not specified in the court order, but it is likely that it pertains to hunting or poaching of a wild animal.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the offence was triable by a magistrate, which means that it is a relatively minor offence. This is significant because it suggests that the petitioner is not a serious threat to society and is unlikely to flee or tamper with evidence. The fact that the petitioner had been in custody for over a month with no other cases registered against him also suggests that he is not a habitual offender.

The court, without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, granted bail to the petitioner. This means that the court did not make a determination as to whether the petitioner was guilty or innocent of the offence he was charged with. Instead, the court simply decided that the petitioner should be released from custody pending trial.

The court imposed certain conditions on the petitioner's bail. Specifically, the petitioner was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each. This means that the petitioner had to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he would appear before the trial court on all dates of hearing. The surety bonds were provided by two individuals who agreed to be responsible for the petitioner's appearance in court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner is significant because it reflects the principle of presumption of innocence. This principle holds that a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. By granting bail to the petitioner, the court is acknowledging that he has not yet been proven guilty of the offence he was charged with.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Suram Nath, who had been arrested in connection with an offence under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court granted bail to the petitioner on the condition that he furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each and appear before the trial court on all dates of hearing. The court did not express any opinion on the merits of the case, but its decision to grant bail reflects the principle of presumption of innocence.
