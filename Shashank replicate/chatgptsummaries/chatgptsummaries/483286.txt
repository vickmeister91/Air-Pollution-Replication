The court order in question pertains to a case where the directors of M/s U.S. Dugal and Company were being prosecuted for alleged violation of Sections 18 and 19(4) of the Minimum Wages Act. The Labour Inspector had found that certain registers were not maintained in accordance with the requirements of the Act and had filed a case against the company and its directors. The directors had filed an application under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code for quashing the entire criminal proceeding and the order taking cognizance.

However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the directors could be prosecuted along with the company under the Act and the Rules if a violation was committed, and it was not necessary to pinpoint the specific part played by each of them or their individual responsibility in the complaint. The court also directed the court below to consider the directors' request for a fresh summons and bail.

The Minimum Wages Act is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to ensure that workers are paid a minimum wage for their labour.

Failure to comply with these provisions can result in criminal prosecution.
