In a recent court case, the petitioner challenged the rejection of his application to summon documents related to his alleged illegal confinement. The court ultimately dismissed the case, finding that the petitioner could establish the fact of his confinement during trial by leading evidence in his defense.

The case centered around the petitioner's claim that he had been illegally confined, and his request for documents related to that confinement. The petitioner argued that these documents were necessary to establish the facts of his case and to prove his innocence.

However, the court found that the petitioner did not need these documents to establish the fact of his confinement. Instead, the court held that the petitioner could lead evidence in his defense during trial to establish this fact.

The court's decision was based on the principle that a petitioner must establish the facts of his case through evidence, rather than relying on documents alone. In this case, the court found that the petitioner could establish the fact of his confinement through testimony and other evidence presented during trial.

The court's decision highlights the importance of evidence in legal proceedings. While documents can be helpful in establishing the facts of a case, they are not always necessary. In this case, the court found that the petitioner could establish the fact of his confinement through other means, and therefore dismissed his request for documents.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder that evidence is key in legal proceedings. While documents can be helpful, they are not always necessary, and a petitioner must be prepared to establish the facts of his case through other means if necessary.
