The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) filed a writ petition against R Narayanappa, seeking to quash an order passed by the City Civil Court in Bangalore. The order rejected the petitioner's written statement in a suit for permanent injunction. The petitioner had sought to file the written statement after a delay of five years, citing administrative inconveniences. However, the court rejected the petition, stating that being a statutory body was not a valid ground for interference.

The BDA is a statutory body established under the Bangalore Development Authority Act, 1976. It is responsible for the planning, co-ordination, and implementation of development schemes in the Bangalore Metropolitan Area. The BDA is also responsible for acquiring land for public purposes and developing it for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes.

The suit for permanent injunction was filed by R Narayanappa against the BDA, seeking to restrain the BDA from interfering with his possession of a property. The BDA had acquired the property for a public purpose, but Narayanappa claimed that he was the rightful owner of the property and had been in possession of it for several years.

The BDA filed a written statement in response to the suit, but it was rejected by the City Civil Court on the grounds of delay. The BDA then filed a writ petition in the High Court, seeking to quash the order of the City Civil Court.

The High Court rejected the BDA's petition, stating that being a statutory body was not a valid ground for interference. The court held that the BDA was bound by the same rules of procedure as any other litigant and could not claim special treatment on the basis of its status as a statutory body.

The court also allowed the respondent's counsel to file his memo of appearance within four days. This meant that the respondent's counsel would be able to participate in the proceedings and present their case before the court.

The court's decision has significant implications for statutory bodies like the BDA. It clarifies that such bodies cannot claim special treatment in legal proceedings and must follow the same rules of procedure as any other litigant. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on how statutory bodies approach legal proceedings in the future.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the BDA against R Narayanappa. The court rejected the BDA's petition, stating that being a statutory body was not a valid ground for interference. The court also allowed the respondent's counsel to file his memo of appearance within four days. This decision has significant implications for statutory bodies and clarifies that they must follow the same rules of procedure as any other litigant in legal proceedings.
