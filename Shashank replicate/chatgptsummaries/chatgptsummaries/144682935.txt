The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) recently filed a petition against M/S Osho Upwan, challenging an order by the Financial Commissioner. The petitioner had previously directed the respondent to close down its unit and cancel its license, but the Financial Commissioner set aside these directions, stating that the petitioner had not given the respondent an opportunity to be heard. The court suggested that the petitioner grant the respondent an opportunity to be heard and pass fresh directions under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also clarified that the Financial Commissioner's order would not set a precedent for similar appeals. No costs were awarded.

The case revolves around the pollution caused by M/S Osho Upwan, which is a unit engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling of ready-made garments. The DPCC had issued a show-cause notice to the respondent on 22nd August 2019, alleging that the unit was operating without obtaining the necessary consent from the DPCC and was discharging untreated effluent into the drain. The DPCC had also alleged that the unit was operating in violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The respondent had filed a reply to the show-cause notice, denying the allegations made by the DPCC. The respondent had also submitted that it had obtained the necessary consent from the DPCC and was not discharging untreated effluent into the drain. The respondent had further submitted that it was not violating any provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The DPCC, however, was not satisfied with the reply filed by the respondent and had directed the respondent to close down its unit and cancel its license. The respondent had then filed an appeal before the Financial Commissioner, challenging the order passed by the DPCC. The Financial Commissioner had set aside the directions issued by the DPCC, stating that the petitioner had not given the respondent an opportunity to be heard.

The DPCC had then filed a petition before the court, challenging the order passed by the Financial Commissioner. The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, suggested that the petitioner grant the respondent an opportunity to be heard and pass fresh directions under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court also clarified that the Financial Commissioner's order would not set a precedent for similar appeals.

The court's decision is significant as it emphasizes the importance of giving parties an opportunity to be heard before passing any orders. The court has also clarified that the Financial Commissioner's order would not set a precedent for similar appeals, which means that each case would be decided on its own merits.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of DPCC v. M/S Osho Upwan highlights the importance of giving parties an opportunity to be heard before passing any orders. The court has also clarified that each case would be decided on its own merits and that the Financial Commissioner's order would not set a precedent for similar appeals. The decision is a step towards ensuring that the principles of natural justice are upheld in all legal proceedings.
