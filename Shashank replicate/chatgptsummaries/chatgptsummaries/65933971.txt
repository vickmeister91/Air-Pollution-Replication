The court recently granted bail to Kamal Bhumiya and Ramfal Bhumiya in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The applicants were accused of being in illegal possession of 10-12 kg of beef of Sambhar, a wild animal protected under the Act. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order will remain effective till the end of the trial but will become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, Kamal Bhumiya and Ramfal Bhumiya were accused of being in illegal possession of 10-12 kg of beef of Sambhar, a wild animal protected under the Act. The possession of such meat is a violation of the Act and is punishable under the law. The court, however, did not comment on the merits of the case and granted bail to the applicants.

The court ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. This means that the applicants will have to provide a guarantee that they will appear in court for all hearings and will not abscond. The surety will also have to provide a guarantee that they will pay the bail amount in case the applicants fail to appear in court.

The court's order will remain effective till the end of the trial but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that if the applicants fail to appear in court or violate any of the conditions of the bail, the bail order will become ineffective, and they will be arrested again.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants without commenting on the merits of the case is significant. It indicates that the court did not find any strong evidence against the applicants and that they are not a flight risk. However, it is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the applicants are innocent. The trial will continue, and the applicants will have to prove their innocence in court.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Kamal Bhumiya and Ramfal Bhumiya in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is significant. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order will remain effective till the end of the trial but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the applicants are innocent, and the trial will continue.
