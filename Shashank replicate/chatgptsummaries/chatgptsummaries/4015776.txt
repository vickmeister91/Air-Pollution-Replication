In the first court order, the judge ruled that the employer had the right to verify the training certificates of their employees and that the termination of the petitioners due to invalid certification was justified. The court also stated that the principles of natural justice were not violated in this case and cited a previous judgment to support this. 

The second court order discussed the concept of the "useless formality theory" and natural justice. The court noted that there is a divergence of opinion on whether an applicant must prove their case or a real likelihood of success, and that courts can refuse certain writs even if natural justice is not followed. The court declined to express an opinion on the "useless formality theory" and noted that legal formulations must be considered in the context of the case. The court also noted that post-decisional hearing can sometimes make up for a lack of pre-decisional hearing. Ultimately, the court decided not to grant relief to the concerned employee in this case.

In the third court order, the judge ruled that in a particular case, a post-decisional hearing can make up for the lack of a pre-decisional hearing. The court cited previous judgments and dismissed the petitioners' contention, ultimately dismissing the writ petition.
