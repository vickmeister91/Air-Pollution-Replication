The recent court order pertains to a series of petitions filed by the State of Rajasthan against the Collector of Bundi and others. The issue at hand is related to the alteration of boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The State argues that the issue is covered by a previous judgment of the court and should be decided accordingly. The respondents, on the other hand, argue that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

After hearing both sides, the court ruled that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries and the impugned orders are set aside. The matter is remanded to the Collector to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents in accordance with the Act.

The Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the district of Bundi in Rajasthan. It is spread over an area of 252.79 square kilometers and is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The sanctuary was established in 1982 with the aim of protecting the wildlife and their habitats.

The issue of alteration of boundaries of the sanctuary arose when the Collector of Bundi issued orders in 2016 and 2017, altering the boundaries of the sanctuary. The State of Rajasthan challenged these orders, arguing that they were illegal and without jurisdiction. The State contended that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary as it was a protected area under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the Collector had the power to alter the boundaries under Section 24(2)(a) of the Act. This section empowers the Chief Wildlife Warden to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary or a national park after considering the objections of the affected parties. The respondents contended that the Collector was acting as the Chief Wildlife Warden and had the power to alter the boundaries after considering the objections of the affected parties.

The court, after considering the arguments of both sides, ruled that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary. The court held that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary or a national park was vested only with the Chief Wildlife Warden and not with any other officer. The court also observed that the Collector had not considered the objections of the affected parties before altering the boundaries, as required under the Act.

The court further held that the issue was covered by a previous judgment of the court in the case of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India. In this case, the court had held that the power to alter the boundaries of a sanctuary or a national park was vested only with the Chief Wildlife Warden and not with any other officer. The court observed that the Collector had not followed the guidelines laid down in this judgment and had acted without jurisdiction.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the impugned orders of the Collector and remanded the matter to him to reconsider the objections filed by the respondents in accordance with the Act. The court directed the Collector to consider the objections of the affected parties and to take a decision in accordance with the law.

In conclusion, the recent court order in the case of the State of Rajasthan v. Collector of Bundi and others has clarified the issue of alteration of boundaries of a sanctuary or a national park. The court has held that the power to alter the boundaries is vested only with the Chief Wildlife Warden and not with any other officer. The court has also emphasized the importance of following the guidelines laid down in the previous judgments of the court. The order is a significant step towards protecting the wildlife and their habitats in the country.
