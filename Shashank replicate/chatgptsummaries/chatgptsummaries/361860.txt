In a recent court order, it was stated that a notification under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 cannot be considered valid as it did not go through the proper procedure prescribed by Section 16 of the Act. The respondents in the case had argued that sugarcane may be considered an agricultural product and therefore exempt from the Act, but the court ruled that even if it were to be included in the Act, it would have to go through the proper procedure of being laid before Parliament.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the proper procedure for notifications under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Act was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities, with the aim of preventing and controlling water pollution. The Act also provides for the establishment of a Central Board and State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution.

The court order in this case was issued in response to a petition filed by a sugar mill, which had challenged a demand for cess made by the Central Board of Pollution Control. The petitioner had argued that sugarcane was an agricultural product and therefore exempt from the Act. However, the court ruled that even if sugarcane were to be included in the Act, the notification in question did not go through the proper procedure of being laid before Parliament.

The court order also stated that any demand for cess in pursuance of the notification is not in accordance with the law and the petitioner is entitled to a refund. This is significant as it provides relief to the petitioner and sets a precedent for future cases involving notifications under the Act.

The court order highlights the importance of following proper procedure when enacting notifications under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. It also clarifies the scope of the Act and the exemptions that may be available to certain industries and products.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of adhering to proper procedure when enacting laws and regulations. It also provides relief to the petitioner and sets a precedent for future cases involving notifications under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977.
