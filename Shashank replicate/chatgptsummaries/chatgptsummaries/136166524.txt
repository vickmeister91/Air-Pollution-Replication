The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to environmental issues in India. The first order concerns a petition filed by the Forum for Human, Legal and Ecological Rights, Bansdroni, seeking to protect the first heritage plaza of Kolkata known as "Swabhumi". The court reproduces the observations of O. Chinnappa Reddy, J. in the case of Shri Sachidanand Pandey vs. State of West Bengal, emphasizing the importance of environment as understood by the native Indians of North America. The reply of an Indian Chief to the President of the United States of America is quoted, which talks about the sacredness of the earth and the need to treat it with respect. However, the court order ends abruptly, leaving the outcome of the petition unclear.

The second court order discusses the issue of environmental deterioration in Indian cities and the responsibility of the government to protect and improve the environment. The court examines a case where the government of West Bengal has allotted land for a five-star hotel at the expense of a zoological garden and heritage center. The court emphasizes the importance of considering relevant factors and excluding irrelevant ones when making such decisions. The court also highlights the constitutional directive principle and fundamental duty to protect and improve the environment. The court examines the facts of the case and concludes that the government has not shown enough awareness of the environmental problem and warrants interference by the court. The court orders a halt to the conversion of the heritage center into a luxury hotel.

The third court order pertains to a dispute over the development of a green area called "Swabhumi" in Kolkata. The petitioners are concerned that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) is planning to convert a part of the area into a luxury hotel, which would harm the environment and destroy the heritage of the city. The KMC argues that the proposed development is necessary to increase the commercial viability of the project and enhance the beauty of the place. The West Bengal Pollution Control Board has also submitted a report stating that the proposed development is in compliance with environmental regulations. The court is yet to make a decision on the matter.

The fourth court order discusses a dispute over the construction of a complex in West Bengal, which includes a school of architecture and a hotel. The petitioners argue that the construction is illegal and will have a negative impact on the environment, while the respondents argue that it is in compliance with the lease agreement and will have a positive impact on the area. The court considers the arguments and emphasizes the importance of genuine public interest in filing a petition. Ultimately, the court does not find sufficient evidence to support the petitioners' claims and dismisses the case.

The fifth court order discusses the misuse of Article 32 and Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which should not be used to create bottlenecks in the court system. The court also emphasizes the duty to protect fundamental rights while preventing their misuse. The order also discusses the precautionary principle and burden of proof in environmental cases, stating that the burden of proof should be on those proposing potentially harmful activities. The case in question involves the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board's efforts to control pollution and protect the environment against an industry's attempts to derail their efforts.

The sixth court order concerns the establishment of an industry for production of castor oil derivatives. The appellant Board argued that the proposed industry would fall under the hazardous category of industries and could not be located within 10 km of two lakes. The respondent-Company appealed under Section 28 of the Water Act, and the appellate authority allowed the appeal, stating that the industry was not polluting. The Division Bench held that the writ petitioners had locus standi to file the writ petitions and directed the A.P. Pollution Control Board to grant consent subject to conditions. The court dismissed three public interest cases and allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent-industry.

The seventh court order allowed a writ petition filed by an industry and directed the grant of consent by the A.P. Pollution Control Board subject to conditions. The Board filed five appeals against this judgment. The Supreme Court reiterated the new concept of burden of proof and the precautionary principle. The court also discussed the issue of locus standi and the parameters within which Public Interest Petitions ought to be entertained. The court examined the entire issue on merits and found no cause for unnecessary apprehensions expressed by the writ petitioners. The project was conceived as a commercial venture from its inception.

The eighth and final court order requires the promoters to follow the positive and negative covenants in the lease for a commercial project in Kolkata. The court notes that the project was planned in detail and stopping its development would harm the city. However, the court cautions the promoters and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation to ensure that the project matches the aesthetic beauty of other world-class facilities. The writ petition is dismissed, but no costs are ordered.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of protecting the environment and balancing economic development with environmental concerns. The courts emphasize the need to consider relevant factors and exclude irrelevant ones when making decisions that impact the environment. The courts also discuss the burden of proof and the precautionary principle in environmental cases, as well as the importance of genuine public interest in filing a petition. Overall, these court orders demonstrate the Indian judiciary's commitment to protecting the environment and upholding the constitutional directive principle and fundamental duty to protect and improve the environment.
