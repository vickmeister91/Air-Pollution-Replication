The Kalasa-Bhandura Project has been a contentious issue in Karnataka for several years. The project aims to divert water from the Kalasa and Banduri tributaries of the Mahadayi river to the Malaprabha river, which is a major source of water for the state. The project has been opposed by environmentalists and activists who claim that it will have a detrimental impact on the ecology of the Western Ghats and the wildlife sanctuary in the region.

In this context, a writ petition was filed by Ravendra Kumar Saini against the State of Karnataka and other respondents regarding the Kalasa-Bhandura Project. The petitioner alleged that the project violates the Forest Conservation Act and Water Right Protection Act and will affect the wildlife sanctuary and ecology of the forest environment. The petitioner sought detailed project reports and other documents from the respondents and a writ of prohibition preventing them from proceeding with the project.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, ordered that the project cannot be executed in the forest area without necessary clearance from the authorities. The court also disposed of the writ petition. This order has been welcomed by environmentalists and activists who have been fighting against the project.

The court's order is significant as it recognizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife in the Western Ghats. The Western Ghats are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and are home to several endangered species of flora and fauna. The court's order ensures that the project will not be executed without proper clearance from the authorities, which will involve a thorough assessment of the impact of the project on the environment and wildlife.

The court's order also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in government projects. The petitioner had sought detailed project reports and other documents from the respondents, which indicates a lack of transparency in the project. The court's order ensures that the respondents will have to provide all necessary documents and reports to the authorities and the public, which will enable a more informed decision-making process.

The court's order is a victory for environmentalists and activists who have been fighting against the project for several years. The project has been opposed by several organizations, including the Goa Foundation, which had filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the project. The court's order is a step towards protecting the environment and wildlife in the Western Ghats and ensuring that government projects are executed in a transparent and accountable manner.

In conclusion, the court's order in the writ petition filed by Ravendra Kumar Saini against the State of Karnataka and other respondents regarding the Kalasa-Bhandura Project is a significant step towards protecting the environment and wildlife in the Western Ghats. The court's order ensures that the project will not be executed without proper clearance from the authorities and highlights the need for transparency and accountability in government projects. The court's order is a victory for environmentalists and activists who have been fighting against the project for several years and is a step towards ensuring that government projects are executed in a responsible and sustainable manner.
