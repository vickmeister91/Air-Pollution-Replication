The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case in which M/S Hamdard Laboratories challenged orders passed by the Cess Appellate Committee, which held that the company was liable to pay the cess tax under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974. The company argued that it was not a specified industry under Section 2(C) of the Cess Act and that its industry was not covered under Schedule 1. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined relevant provisions of the Cess Act, including Schedules 1 and 2. The court reserved its decision on the matter.

The court upheld the committee's decision and dismissed the writ petition.
