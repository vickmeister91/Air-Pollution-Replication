The issue of property tax on electricity transmission towers in Delhi was brought before the court in several petitions filed by the Power Grid Corporation of India and Delhi Transco Ltd. The East Delhi Municipal Corporation had passed assessment orders, assessing the towers to property tax under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act. The main issue before the court was whether the towers fell within the definition of "building" under the Act and whether they were assessable to property tax as "towers" under the Property Tax Byelaws.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately ruled in favor of the municipal corporation, stating that the towers were indeed assessable to property tax. The court found that the definition of "building" was wide enough to include any structure, and the words "any other structure" in the MCD Act could not be given a restrictive meaning. The court also noted that there were machinery provisions for determining the annual value of a covered space of a building, but none for electricity transmission towers.

However, in another court order, the court found that there was no machinery provision to determine the covered space of electricity transmission towers, which is necessary to calculate the property tax. The court also noted that the towers are standalone structures and do not fall under the category of towers as defined in the Property Tax Byelaws. Therefore, the court concluded that the assessments framed for property tax on Electricity Transmission Towers must fail. The court emphasized that taxation laws must be strictly construed and must be based on clear and unambiguous language.

The court also emphasized that a taxing statute must be clearly and unambiguously worded, and that if a case is not covered within the provisions of a taxing statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or analogy. In a separate order, the court allowed the petitions and set aside the assessment orders, disposing of pending applications.

In summary, the court orders dealt with the issue of property tax on electricity transmission towers in Delhi. While one order ruled in favor of the municipal corporation, stating that the towers were assessable to property tax, another order found that there was no machinery provision to determine the covered space of the towers, and therefore the assessments framed for property tax must fail. The court emphasized that taxation laws must be strictly construed and must be based on clear and unambiguous language, and that if a case is not covered within the provisions of a taxing statute, no tax can be imposed by inference or analogy.
