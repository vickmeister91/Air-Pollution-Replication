The court order in question pertains to the implementation of a notification issued by the Central Government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 for monitoring sand mining or river bed mining in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The notification was issued in response to concerns about the environmental impact of such mining activities, which can cause damage to river ecosystems and lead to erosion and other problems.

The State Government of Madhya Pradesh has taken an in-principle decision to implement the procedures stipulated in the notification within six months. This decision was made in response to a petition filed by an environmental activist group, which argued that the state government had not taken sufficient steps to regulate sand mining and protect the environment.

In its order, the court directed the Chief Secretary of Madhya Pradesh to constitute a High Power Committee to act as a nodal agency for coordinating with different agencies throughout the state. The committee will be responsible for ensuring that the procedures specified in the notification are implemented effectively and that the environmental impact of sand mining is minimized.

The court also directed the committee to submit a periodical report to the court on a month-to-month basis, disclosing the details about the completion of parameters specified in the notification. This will allow the court to monitor the progress of the implementation process and ensure that the state government is taking appropriate steps to protect the environment.

The court listed the matter for further directions on 20th April 2016, indicating that it will continue to monitor the situation and take further action if necessary. This order represents an important step forward in the regulation of sand mining in Madhya Pradesh and demonstrates the court's commitment to protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development in the state.

Sand mining is a major industry in many parts of India, and it is important to balance the economic benefits of this activity with the need to protect the environment. The court's order in this case represents a positive step towards achieving this balance and ensuring that sand mining is conducted in a responsible and sustainable manner. It is hoped that other states will follow Madhya Pradesh's example and take similar steps to regulate sand mining and protect the environment.
