The court order in question pertains to a dispute between Indian Telephone Industry Ltd. and the Cess Appellate Committee in Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner argued that their factory, which manufactures telephone and telecommunication instruments, does not fall under the Schedule Industries mentioned in the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court examined the definition of metallurgy and concluded that the petitioner's industry does not engage in metallurgy as it does not extract metals from their ores. The court also cited previous decisions to establish that it is the end product, not the raw materials used, that determines the nature of the industry.

The Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons operating and maintaining specified types of industrial units. The Act defines "Schedule Industries" as those industries that are listed in the Schedule to the Act. The Act also provides for the constitution of a Cess Appellate Committee to hear appeals against orders passed by the assessing authorities under the Act.

In this case, the petitioner, Indian Telephone Industry Ltd., argued that their factory, which manufactures telephone and telecommunication instruments, does not fall under the Schedule Industries mentioned in the Act. The petitioner contended that their industry does not engage in metallurgy, which is one of the industries listed in the Schedule to the Act. The petitioner argued that their industry only uses metals as raw materials and does not extract metals from their ores.

The court examined the definition of metallurgy and concluded that the petitioner's industry does not engage in metallurgy as it does not extract metals from their ores. The court noted that metallurgy involves the extraction of metals from their ores and the production of alloys, whereas the petitioner's industry only uses metals as raw materials to manufacture telephone and telecommunication instruments. The court also cited previous decisions to establish that it is the end product, not the raw materials used, that determines the nature of the industry.

The court observed that the petitioner's industry falls under the category of "electronic and telecommunication equipment" as per the National Industrial Classification (NIC) code. The court noted that the NIC code is a classification system used by the government to classify industries based on their economic activities. The court held that the petitioner's industry is not a Schedule Industry under the Act and, therefore, is not liable to pay water Cess.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the impugned order of the Appellate Committee, directing the respondents not to demand water Cess from the petitioner and to refund any amount paid with interest. The court held that the respondents had wrongly classified the petitioner's industry as a Schedule Industry under the Act and had demanded water Cess from the petitioner. The court directed the respondents to refund any amount paid by the petitioner with interest.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a dispute between Indian Telephone Industry Ltd. and the Cess Appellate Committee in Uttar Pradesh. The court examined the definition of metallurgy and concluded that the petitioner's industry does not engage in metallurgy as it does not extract metals from their ores. The court also cited previous decisions to establish that it is the end product, not the raw materials used, that determines the nature of the industry. The court held that the petitioner's industry is not a Schedule Industry under the Water (Prevention and Control Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, and, therefore, is not liable to pay water Cess. The court allowed the petition and quashed the impugned order of the Appellate Committee, directing the respondents not to demand water Cess from the petitioner and to refund any amount paid with interest.
