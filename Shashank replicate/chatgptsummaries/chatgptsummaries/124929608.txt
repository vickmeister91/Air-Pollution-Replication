The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a public interest litigation filed by the Institute of Social Welfare against the State of Kerala and other authorities. The petitioner had sought a writ mandamus to prepare Local Level Coastal Zone Management Maps as required by the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991. However, during the hearing, it was brought to the court's notice that the Government of India had issued a Coastal Regulation Zone Notification in 2011, which provided for the preparation of Coastal Zone Management Plans. The court found that the main grievance of the petitioner was redressed by this provision in the notification. 

The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991, was enacted to regulate development activities in the coastal areas of the country. The notification classified the coastal areas into different zones, and activities were allowed or prohibited based on the zone in which they were located. The notification also required the preparation of Local Level Coastal Zone Management Maps to ensure that development activities were carried out in a sustainable manner. 

The petitioner in this case had alleged that the authorities had not prepared the Local Level Coastal Zone Management Maps as required by the notification. The petitioner had also alleged that the authorities were issuing Coastal Regulation Zone clearance certificates without following the due process. The petitioner had sought a writ mandamus to direct the authorities to prepare the maps and to regulate the issuance of clearance certificates. 

During the hearing, the court noted that the Government of India had issued a Coastal Regulation Zone Notification in 2011, which provided for the preparation of Coastal Zone Management Plans. The court found that this provision in the notification had redressed the main grievance of the petitioner. The court also noted that the issuance of CRZ clearance certificates was already regulated by a government notification. Therefore, the court closed the writ petition. 

The judgment of the court is significant as it highlights the importance of sustainable development in the coastal areas of the country. The Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 1991, was enacted to ensure that development activities in the coastal areas were carried out in a sustainable manner.
