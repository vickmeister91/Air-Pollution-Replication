The first court order pertains to a suit for recovery of damages filed by the mother of a deceased fireman who died in a train accident. The defendant in the case was the Union of India representing the Indian Railways. The defendant contested the suit on various grounds, including the bar of the suit by the Workmen's Compensation Act and the Indian Railways Accidents Act, and the doctrine of common employment.

The court overruled the defense and decreed the plaintiff's suit for a reduced amount. The court also discussed the applicability of the Workmen's Compensation Act and the doctrine of common employment. The court held that the suit was not barred by the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act and that the doctrine of common employment was still applicable.

The court also discussed the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act and held that the suit was curable, and decrees could be passed for awarding one-third of the compensation to the plaintiff and two-thirds to the defendant.

The second court order deals with a clause in question that did not cover the case at hand, leaving the plea of common employment open. The court rejected the argument that the legislature's expression of intention in the amending Act of 1951 should be used to interpret the former law.

The court found that the Employers' Liability Act did not apply to the case and that negligence on the part of the railway administration's employees was the cause of the accident. However, the court found that the defense of common employment was open to the appellant, and the appeal was allowed.

The court recommended that the railway administration consider awarding compensation to the respondents.
