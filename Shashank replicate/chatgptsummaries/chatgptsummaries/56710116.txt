The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/S Manik Prabhu Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner had sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit. 

The court found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and allowed the operation of the crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court also quashed the closure notice issued by the Pollution Control Board.

The petitioner, M/S Manik Prabhu Stone Crusher, had challenged the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board on the grounds that it was arbitrary and illegal. The petitioner had contended that the closure notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity to be heard and that it was based on incorrect and incomplete information.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and that the closure notice was issued without following due process of law. The court also found that the petitioner had submitted all the necessary documents and had complied with all the requirements for operating the crushing unit.

The court, therefore, allowed the operation of the crushing unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The court also directed the competent authority to consider the petitioner's application to operate the crushing unit and dispose of it in accordance with the law.

The court's decision to quash the closure notice issued by the Pollution Control Board was based on the fact that the notice was issued without following due process of law. The court found that the Pollution Control Board had not given the petitioner any prior notice or opportunity to be heard before issuing the closure notice. The court also found that the Pollution Control Board had not considered all the relevant facts and had based its decision on incorrect and incomplete information.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of natural justice and due process of law. The court has made it clear that government authorities cannot act arbitrarily and must follow the law while exercising their powers. The court's decision also ensures that legitimate businesses are not unfairly targeted by government authorities.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Karnataka High Court in response to the writ petition filed by M/S Manik Prabhu Stone Crusher is a significant decision that upholds the principles of natural justice and due process of law. The court's decision to allow the operation of the crushing unit at the present site until its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order and to quash the closure notice issued by the Pollution Control Board is a victory for the petitioner and ensures that legitimate businesses are not unfairly targeted by government authorities.
