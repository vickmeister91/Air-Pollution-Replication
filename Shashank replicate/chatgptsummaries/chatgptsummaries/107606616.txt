The Ernakulam Karayogam society had filed a writ petition against the District Geologist for insisting on an environmental clearance certificate as a precondition for considering their application for mining permit and transit pass. The society argued that their project did not require an environmental clearance certificate as it involved a building and construction up to an extent of 20,000 Sq. meters. The court found that the society's argument was valid and directed the 1st respondent to consider the application submitted by the petitioner for mining permit and transit passes without insisting on an environmental clearance certificate.

The court's decision was based on the Environment Protection Act and Rules and the Notification dated 14.09.2006 of the Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. According to these laws, any project involving a building and construction up to an extent of 20,000 Sq. meters, is not required to get a prior environmental clearance. The court found that the society's project fell within this limit and therefore did not require an environmental clearance certificate.

The court's decision was a significant victory for the Ernakulam Karayogam society, as it allowed them to proceed with their project without the additional burden of obtaining an environmental clearance certificate. The court's decision also clarified the legal requirements for obtaining an environmental clearance certificate, which will be helpful for other organizations and individuals who are planning similar projects.

The court's order directed the 1st respondent to consider the application submitted by the petitioner for mining permit and transit passes without insisting on an environmental clearance certificate. The 1st respondent was ordered to consider the application within two weeks. This order ensured that the society's application would be processed quickly and without any unnecessary delays.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the Ernakulam Karayogam society's case was a significant victory for the society and clarified the legal requirements for obtaining an environmental clearance certificate. The court's order directed the 1st respondent to consider the society's application for mining permit and transit passes without insisting on an environmental clearance certificate, ensuring that the application would be processed quickly and without any unnecessary delays.
