The case revolves around the dishonor of two post-dated cheques issued by the respondent to the appellant. The appellant had claimed that the respondent had borrowed Rs. 4 lakhs as a hand loan and issued two post-dated cheques as security. However, when the cheques were presented for payment, they were dishonored due to insufficient funds. The appellant then initiated a prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, against the respondent.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, deals with the dishonor of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer.

The court also observed that the appellant had failed to prove that the cheques were issued as security for the debt.
