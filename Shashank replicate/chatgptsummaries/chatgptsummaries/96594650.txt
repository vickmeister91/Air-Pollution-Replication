The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which involve allegations of environmental violations. In the first case, a private complaint was filed against M/s. Madras Cements Limited for not obtaining necessary clearance certificates for establishing a thermal plant. The complaint was dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in 2012. However, a new complaint was filed against Balaji, Member Secretary, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and Vijaya Baskaran, District Environmental Engineer, alleging that they did not take any action against M/s. Madras Cements Limited for commencing the construction work without the clearance certificate. The accused filed criminal original petitions to quash the proceedings, claiming that the complaint was an abuse of process of law. The court heard the arguments of both sides and reserved the order.

In the second case, the accused, who are public servants, were charged with not obtaining prior sanction to prosecute them for a private complaint against them. The court considered the arguments of both sides and concluded that the accused had not committed any cognizable offense and that there was no law that cast a duty upon them to give information of the commission of an offense under the Environment (Protection) Act to a specified authority. Therefore, the prosecution of the accused under Section 202 I.P.C. was deemed illegal, and the criminal original petitions were allowed, and the prosecution against the accused was quashed.

In the first case, the court was tasked with determining whether the complaint against Balaji and Vijaya Baskaran was an abuse of process of law. The complaint alleged that the accused did not take any action against M/s. Madras Cements Limited for commencing the construction work without the necessary clearance certificate. The accused argued that the complaint was an abuse of process of law because the same complaint had been dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in 2012.

The court heard the arguments of both sides and reserved the order. In its order, the court noted that the complaint against Balaji and Vijaya Baskaran was not identical to the complaint that had been dismissed by the learned Judicial Magistrate in 2012. The court also noted that the accused had not obtained the necessary clearance certificate before commencing the construction work. Therefore, the court held that the complaint was not an abuse of process of law and allowed the proceedings to continue.

In the second case, the accused were charged with not obtaining prior sanction to prosecute them for a private complaint against them. The court considered the arguments of both sides and concluded that the accused had not committed any cognizable offense. The court noted that there was no law that cast a duty upon the accused to give information of the commission of an offense under the Environment (Protection) Act to a specified authority. Therefore, the prosecution of the accused under Section 202 I.P.C. was deemed illegal, and the criminal original petitions were allowed, and the prosecution against the accused was quashed.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate cases involving allegations of environmental violations. In the first case, the court allowed the proceedings to continue against Balaji and Vijaya Baskaran, who were accused of not taking action against M/s. Madras Cements Limited for commencing construction work without the necessary clearance certificate. In the second case, the court quashed the prosecution of the accused, who were public servants, for not obtaining prior sanction to prosecute them for a private complaint against them. The court held that the accused had not committed any cognizable offense and that there was no law that cast a duty upon them to give information of the commission of an offense under the Environment (Protection) Act to a specified authority.
