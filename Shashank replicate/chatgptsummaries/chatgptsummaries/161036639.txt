The Supreme Court has recently issued an order in response to a grievance filed by the Him Jagriti Uttaranchal Welfare Society. The grievance pertained to the tagging of Original Application No. 15 of 2014 for hearing and disposal together with Original Application No. 606 of 2018 before the National Green Tribunal. The appellant argued that the scope and ambit of the two applications were distinct, and that the issues raised in OA No. 15 of 2014 were unrelated to those in OA No. 606 of 2018.

The main grievance raised by the appellant in OA No. 15 of 2014 pertained to health hazards associated with the use of plastic packaging in connection with food and edible preparations. The Supreme Court acknowledged the distinct nature of the issues raised in the two applications and directed that OA No. 15 of 2014 be de-linked from the hearing of OA No. 606 of 2018.

The order issued by the Supreme Court directed that the appeals be disposed of without expressing any view on the merits. This means that the court did not make any determination as to the validity or strength of the arguments put forth by the appellant in OA No. 15 of 2014.

In addition to the order to dispose of the appeals, the Supreme Court also mentioned the names of the lawyers involved in the case. This information is likely included for the purposes of record-keeping and to ensure that all parties involved in the case are properly identified.

Overall, the order issued by the Supreme Court in response to the grievance filed by the Him Jagriti Uttaranchal Welfare Society serves to clarify the distinct nature of the issues raised in OA No. 15 of 2014 and OA No. 606 of 2018. By de-linking the two applications, the court has ensured that each will be heard and disposed of on its own merits. The inclusion of the names of the lawyers involved in the case further serves to ensure that all parties are properly identified and accounted for in the court's records.
