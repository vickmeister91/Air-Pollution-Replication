The case in question involves serious allegations of abduction, rape, and unlawful restraint. The accused, Chandra Reddy and Sudha, are facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to place on record a mahazar, which was not included earlier. The mahazar is a document that records the seizure of any property or article by the police during an investigation. The prosecution argued that the mahazar was crucial to the case and should be placed on record.

However, the accused objected to the application, stating that the document was concocted and not coming from proper custody. They argued that the mahazar was not prepared at the time of the seizure and was fabricated later to strengthen the prosecution's case. The accused also argued that the document was not coming from proper custody and could not be relied upon.

The court considered the arguments of both parties and allowed the application filed by the prosecution. The court held that the mahazar was a crucial document and should be placed on record. The court also observed that the validity of the document has to be adjudicated upon during the course of the trial and that the prosecution has not tried to fill up any lacuna.

The accused then filed a petition seeking to set aside the order passed by the court. They argued that the court had erred in allowing the application filed by the prosecution and that the mahazar was not a genuine document. They also argued that the document was not coming from proper custody and could not be relied upon.
