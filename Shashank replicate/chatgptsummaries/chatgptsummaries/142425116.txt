The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by C.H. Mohammed Abbas against Smt. Shafinaz Begum. Abbas had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to obtain certain documents related to the marriage between Begum and her first husband. However, the application was rejected by the Magistrate, and the revision against the order was also dismissed.

The court observed that Abbas had not applied for the copies of those documents and had straightaway filed an application before the court. The court noted that the procedure for obtaining documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. requires the applicant to first apply for the copies of the documents from the concerned authority and only if the copies are not provided, can the applicant approach the court for the same.

The court further observed that the Magistrate had rightly rejected Abbas' application as he had not followed the proper procedure for obtaining the documents. The court also noted that the revision against the order was rightly dismissed as there was no error in the Magistrate's order.

In light of these observations, the court disposed of the petition filed by Abbas. The court's order serves as a reminder to litigants to follow the proper procedure for obtaining documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and not to approach the court directly without first applying for the copies of the documents from the concerned authority.

It is important to note that Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also provides for the procedure for obtaining such documents or things.

The procedure requires the applicant to first apply for the copies of the documents or things from the concerned authority. If the copies are not provided, the applicant can approach the court for the same. However, if the copies are provided, the applicant cannot approach the court for the same documents or things.

The court's order in this case highlights the importance of following the proper procedure for obtaining documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and serves as a cautionary tale for litigants who may be tempted to approach the court directly without first applying for the copies of the documents from the concerned authority.

In conclusion, the court's order in the criminal petition filed by C.H. Mohammed Abbas against Smt. Shafinaz Begum serves as a reminder to litigants to follow the proper procedure for obtaining documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and not to approach the court directly without first applying for the copies of the documents from the concerned authority. The court's observations in the case highlight the importance of adhering to the procedural requirements of the law and serve as a cautionary tale for litigants who may be tempted to take shortcuts in the legal process.
