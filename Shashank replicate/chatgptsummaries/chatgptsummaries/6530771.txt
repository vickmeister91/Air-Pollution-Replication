The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Maninder Kaur seeking to quash an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Tarn Taran, upholding the order of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tarn Taran, rejecting her application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. seeking to summon relevant records in a criminal case. The court found that the orders passed by both the lower courts were correct and as per the law, and dismissed the petition.

The case in question involves a criminal matter, and Maninder Kaur had sought to summon relevant records in order to support her case. However, her application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. was rejected by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tarn Taran. Kaur then appealed this decision to the Additional Sessions Judge, Tarn Taran, who upheld the lower court's decision. Kaur then filed a petition to quash this order, which was dismissed by the court.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) allows a court to issue a summons to produce a document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. However, the court may only issue such a summons if it is satisfied that the document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding.

In this case, the court found that the lower courts had correctly applied the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. and had properly exercised their discretion in rejecting Kaur's application to summon relevant records. The court noted that Kaur had failed to demonstrate how the documents she sought to summon were necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding, and that the lower courts had therefore been justified in rejecting her application.

The court's decision highlights the importance of demonstrating the relevance and necessity of any documents or other evidence that a party seeks to produce in a criminal proceeding. While Section 91 Cr.P.C. provides a mechanism for parties to obtain such evidence, the court will only issue a summons if it is satisfied that the evidence is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding. Parties must therefore be prepared to demonstrate the relevance and necessity of any evidence they seek to produce, and to provide a clear and compelling argument in support of their application.

Overall, the court's decision in this case reinforces the importance of following proper legal procedures and demonstrating the relevance and necessity of any evidence that is sought to be produced in a criminal proceeding. While parties have the right to seek relevant evidence, they must do so in accordance with the provisions of the Cr.P.C. and must be prepared to demonstrate the relevance and necessity of any evidence they seek to produce. Failure to do so may result in their application being rejected, as was the case with Maninder Kaur's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C.
