The Delhi High Court recently heard two appeals from Dua Polymers Pvt Ltd and Sanjay Plastic Industries, who had applied for industrial land in 1996 and were required to pay 30% of the revised estimated cost of the plot by 31 October 2000. The appellants did not comply with this and their allotment was cancelled in 2002. They approached the court in 2008 for redressal of their grievance, but the writ petition was dismissed on the grounds of delay and laches. The appellants argued that the learned Single Judge had erred in not adjudicating on the merits of the case and that the doctrine of delay and laches should not apply. The court considered the issue of whether the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIDC) had committed any illegality by cancelling the letter of allotment issued in favour of the appellants.

The court observed that the appellants had not complied with the terms of the allotment letter and had failed to pay the required amount by the stipulated date. The court also noted that the appellants had not challenged the cancellation of the allotment letter within the prescribed time limit. The court held that the doctrine of delay and laches applied in this case, as the appellants had not approached the court for redressal of their grievance for a period of six years after the cancellation of the allotment letter. The court further held that the learned Single Judge had not erred in dismissing the writ petition on the grounds of delay and laches.

The court also discussed a case where the appellant failed to challenge the legality of demands and claim relief for earlier years while challenging the demand for subsequent years. However, the court ruled that the failure to do so does not disentitle the appellant from remedies under the law. The demand was found to be illegal, and the court rejected the appellant's argument that delay in filing the writ petition was due to representations made to the authorities. The court cited previous cases to emphasize that stale claims do not get a new lease of life because of representations made to the authorities, and a direction to consider a representation does not create a new cause of action. The court dismissed the appeals without any order as to costs.

In summary, the Delhi High Court has held that the doctrine of delay and laches applies in cases where the appellants have not approached the court for redressal of their grievance for a period of time after the cancellation of the allotment letter. The court has also ruled that the failure to challenge the legality of demands and claim relief for earlier years while challenging the demand for subsequent years does not disentitle the appellant from remedies under the law.
