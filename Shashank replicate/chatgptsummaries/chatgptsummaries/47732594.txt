The case of Arman Khan was related to offences under Sections 9, 39, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. He had filed a second bail application under section 439 of Cr.P.C. seeking bail. The court granted bail to the applicant on the grounds that the period of three months had already elapsed, the allegation of hunting was against a co-accused, and the applicant had been in custody for more than 5 months. The court considered the fact that the applicant had already been in custody for a considerable period of time and that the allegation of hunting was against a co-accused, not against the applicant himself. The court also noted that the period of three months had already elapsed, which meant that the investigation had been completed and the chargesheet had been filed. 

The court further observed that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court also took into account the fact that the applicant had a family to support and that he had been in custody for more than 5 months, which had caused him considerable hardship. 

The court, therefore, granted bail to the applicant on the condition of furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of JMFC concerned or CJM for his appearance in Trial Court on the dates so fixed by that Court during trial. The court also directed the applicant to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the trial court on the dates fixed by that court. 

In conclusion, the court granted bail to Arman Khan on the grounds that the period of three months had already elapsed, the allegation of hunting was against a co-accused, and the applicant had been in custody for more than 5 months. The court also considered the fact that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and that he was not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court, therefore, granted bail to the applicant on the condition of furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000/- with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of JMFC concerned or CJM for his appearance in Trial Court on the dates so fixed by that Court during trial.
