The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case between the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board and CCL Products (India) Ltd. The case involved the invocation of three bank guarantees issued to the appellant and the direction to refund the amounts covered by them to the respondent. The bank guarantees were issued to secure compliance with environmental standards. The court examined the stipulations of each bank guarantee and ultimately upheld the National Green Tribunal's decision to allow the appeal of the respondent in part and refund the amount covered by the bank guarantees.

The court order restricts the bank guarantee to Rs. 10,00,000 and states that it will remain in force until 06.09.2013 unless a claim is filed before that date. The appellant invoked the bank guarantees without providing a hearing to the respondent, which led to the Tribunal setting aside the invocation. However, the court holds that a bank guarantee is an independent contract and the invocation must be in accordance with its terms. The court cites previous cases to support this principle and concludes that the Tribunal's decision does not warrant interference.

The court order states that a bank guarantee must be honored as long as it is invoked in accordance with its terms, unless there is fraud, irretrievable injustice, or special equities. In this case, the bank guarantee was invoked correctly and the appellant was entitled to receive the guaranteed amount. The court found that the Tribunal erred in directing the appellant to refund the amount covered by the guarantees and allowed the appeal. The court also noted that the respondent was aware of the invocation of the bank guarantees and had failed to comply with environmental standards. The appeal was admitted and allowed in terms of the signed reportable judgment.
