The court order in question pertains to an application filed by Tribhuvan Singh and others to quash an order passed by the Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, Ghaziabad in Special Case No. 11 of 2009. The applicants had moved applications to admit certain documents to the record of the case, which were dismissed by the learned Special Judge. The applicants had invoked the provisions of Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the order. However, the court refused to interfere with the impugned order at this stage, as the applicants will have full opportunity to invoke the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage.

The case in question involves allegations of corruption against certain individuals, including Tribhuvan Singh and others. The applicants had sought to introduce certain documents into the record of the case, which they claimed would be crucial to their defense. However, the Special Judge had dismissed their applications, prompting the applicants to file an application under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to quash the order.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The applicants had argued that the Special Judge's order was erroneous and had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. They had therefore sought the High Court's intervention to quash the order and allow them to introduce the documents in question.

However, the High Court refused to interfere with the Special Judge's order at this stage. The court noted that the applicants would have a full opportunity to invoke the provisions of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other material that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

The High Court's decision not to interfere with the Special Judge's order is significant as it underscores the importance of following due process in criminal cases. The court's decision suggests that the applicants will have to follow the proper procedure under the Cr.P.C. to introduce the documents in question. This is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties to a case be given a fair and equal opportunity to present their case.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of the provisions of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in criminal cases. Section 91 empowers a court to order the production of any document or other material that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. This provision is crucial in ensuring that all relevant evidence is presented before the court and that justice is done.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application filed by Tribhuvan Singh and others to quash an order passed by the Special Judge, Prevention of Corruption Act, Ghaziabad in Special Case No. 11 of 2009. The court refused to interfere with the impugned order at this stage, as the applicants will have full opportunity to invoke the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage. The court's decision underscores the importance of following due process in criminal cases and highlights the importance of the provisions of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in ensuring that justice is done.
