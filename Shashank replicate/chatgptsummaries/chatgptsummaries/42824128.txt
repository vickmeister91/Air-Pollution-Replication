The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, including wild boars, and possession of their meat. Laluram Baiga was arrested for violating this law by possessing 45 kgs of wild boar meat.

The applicant filed for bail under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C., which allows a person to apply for bail before or after the arrest. The court allowed the application and directed the release of Laluram Baiga on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount. A personal bond is a written promise by the accused to appear in court when required, and a solvent surety is a person who guarantees the payment of the bond amount if the accused fails to appear in court.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions on Laluram Baiga's release. These conditions are laid down under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. and include:

2. The accused shall surrender his passport, if any, to the court.

3. The accused shall not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

4. The accused shall cooperate with the investigation and attend the court as and when required.

5. The accused shall not commit any offence while on bail.

The court warned Laluram Baiga that any breach of these conditions would result in coercive action by the trial court. Coercive action may include cancellation of bail, arrest, or imposition of a fine.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Laluram Baiga allows him to be released on bail on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with one solvent surety of the same amount. However, he must abide by certain conditions laid down under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. Any breach of these conditions will result in coercive action by the trial court. The court order highlights the importance of following the law and the consequences of violating it.
