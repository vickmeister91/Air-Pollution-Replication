The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under section 482 Cr.P.C. by the accused petitioners in a murder trial. The petitioners had requested the production of a log book maintained at the Control Room of the Police Line for the purpose of verifying the time of lodging of the First Information Report (FIR). The trial court had rejected the application, and the petitioners had filed the present petition to quash the order.

The petitioners had argued that the log book maintained at the Control Room of the Police Line was crucial evidence in the case, as it would help establish the exact time at which the FIR was lodged. They had contended that the FIR was lodged much later than the time recorded in the log book, and that this discrepancy was a crucial factor in the case.

The trial court had rejected the petitioners' application on the grounds that the log book was not a public document, and that the petitioners had failed to establish that it was necessary for the just decision of the case. The court had also noted that the petitioners had not made any effort to obtain the log book through the proper channels, such as by issuing a notice to the police.

The petitioners had challenged the trial court's order on the grounds that it was arbitrary and illegal. They had argued that the log book was a crucial piece of evidence, and that the trial court had erred in rejecting their application without giving any reasons.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the trial court to pass a fresh order on the application if the petitioners move a fresh application for keeping the log book of the Police Control Room of the relevant dates under safe cover. The court noted that the log book was not a public document, and that the petitioners would have to establish that it was necessary for the just decision of the case.

The court also observed that the trial court had not given any reasons for rejecting the petitioners' application, and that this was a serious lapse. The court emphasized that the trial court must give reasons for its orders, and that failure to do so would render the order liable to be set aside.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed by the accused petitioners in a murder trial, seeking the production of a log book maintained at the Control Room of the Police Line for the purpose of verifying the time of lodging of the FIR. The trial court had rejected the application, and the petitioners had filed the present petition to quash the order. The court directed the trial court to pass a fresh order on the application if the petitioners move a fresh application for keeping the log book of the Police Control Room of the relevant dates under safe cover. The court emphasized the importance of giving reasons for orders, and noted that failure to do so would render the order liable to be set aside.
