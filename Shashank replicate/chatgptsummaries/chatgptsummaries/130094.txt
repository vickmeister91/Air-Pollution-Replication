The court order pertains to a case where a landlord filed eight Rent Control Petitions against different tenants, seeking eviction under Section 11(3) of Act 2/65. The Rent Control Court allowed a joint trial of all the petitions and passed a common order of eviction. The tenants challenged this order, arguing that the joint trial was unsustainable since there were differentiality in their defensive pleas. However, the court held that the objection raised for the first time before this Court regarding joint trial must necessarily fail, as no objection was raised before the Rent Control Court or before the Rent Control Appellate Authority. The court also cited previous cases where joint trials were allowed in similar situations.

The court order dismisses the objection raised by tenants regarding the procedure followed by the Rent Control Court and Appellate Authority. The court finds that the joint trial was not opposed and did not affect the jurisdiction of the Rent Control Court. The court also upholds the landlord's bonafide need for the entire building for conducting department stores. The tenants are granted time until December 31, 2011, to vacate the premises and must file affidavits undertaking to give peaceful surrender of the building and pay occupation charges of Rs. 1,500 per month. Failure to comply with these conditions will result in the tenants losing the benefit of the extension of time.
