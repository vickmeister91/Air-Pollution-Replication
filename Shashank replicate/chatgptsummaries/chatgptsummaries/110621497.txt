Arshid Khan, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, filed an application for anticipatory bail in a case of hunting blackbucks under the Wild Life Protection Act. However, the court dismissed his application for anticipatory bail as it would not be appropriate to grant it to him, given the role ascribed to him in the statement of his co-accused.

The prosecution claimed that Khan and his co-accused went on a motorcycle to hunt blackbucks. Khan's co-accused fired three shots at the blackbucks, injuring one. Khan then cut the throat of the injured blackbuck, but they left the carcass when they heard people shouting. The guns of all villagers were seized and sent for ballistic examination, and it was found that the bullet seized from the body of the blackbuck was fired from the gun owned by Khan's co-accused.

The court's decision to dismiss Khan's application for anticipatory bail was based on the evidence presented by the prosecution. The court found that Khan's role in the incident was significant, and he could not be granted anticipatory bail. The court's decision was in line with the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, which prohibits hunting of protected animals.
