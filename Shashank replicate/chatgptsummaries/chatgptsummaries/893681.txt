In a case involving Parry Agro Industries Ltd. and the Forest Range Officer, the court issued a ruling that clarified the proper authority for issuing orders related to the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882. The Forest Range Officer had issued an order to Parry Agro Industries Ltd. to dismantle materials and find an alternative source of water supply, but the company filed a writ petition claiming that the order was in contravention of the Act. 

The learned single Judge who heard the case found that the Forest Range Officer was not competent to issue such an order and quashed it. However, the Forest Range Officer appealed the decision, arguing that the order was necessary to protect the forest and its resources. 

The court considered the arguments of both parties and ultimately upheld the decision of the learned single Judge. The court stated that the District Forest Officer, with prior sanction of the Government, is the proper authority empowered to take action against the petitioner. 

This ruling has important implications for the proper interpretation and enforcement of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882. It clarifies that the District Forest Officer is the appropriate authority for issuing orders related to the Act, and that the Forest Range Officer does not have the necessary competence to do so. 

The case also highlights the importance of balancing environmental protection with the needs of industry and commerce. While the Forest Range Officer may have had valid concerns about the impact of Parry Agro Industries Ltd.'s activities on the forest and its resources, the court ultimately found that the order was not properly issued and therefore could not be enforced. 

Overall, this case serves as an important reminder of the need for clear and consistent interpretation and enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. By clarifying the proper authority for issuing orders related to the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882, the court has helped to ensure that the Act is properly enforced and that the forest and its resources are protected for future generations.
