Bhagwati Lal was arrested for offences under Sections 2, 9, 51 of Protection of Wild Life Act and Section 379 IPC. These sections deal with the illegal hunting, killing, or capturing of wild animals and theft. The accused was in custody and had applied for bail. The court has now granted him bail on certain conditions.

The court has ordered Bhagwati Lal to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each. These bonds are to be submitted to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. The accused has also been directed to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The granting of bail is a common practice in the Indian legal system. It allows an accused person to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. However, bail is not granted automatically. The court considers various factors before granting bail, such as the nature of the offence, the evidence against the accused, and the likelihood of the accused fleeing or tampering with evidence.

In this case, the court has considered the offences under which Bhagwati Lal was arrested. These offences are serious in nature and carry significant penalties. The court has also considered the evidence against the accused and the likelihood of him fleeing or tampering with evidence. Based on these factors, the court has granted bail to Bhagwati Lal.

However, the court has imposed certain conditions on the accused. These conditions are designed to ensure that Bhagwati Lal appears before the court on all dates of hearing and does not flee or tamper with evidence. The accused has been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each. These bonds are a form of security that the accused will appear before the court as required. The bonds are to be submitted to the satisfaction of the learned trial court, which means that the court must be satisfied that the bonds are genuine and sufficient.

In addition to the bonds, Bhagwati Lal has been directed to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This is a standard condition of bail and ensures that the accused does not abscond or delay the trial. If the accused fails to appear before the court as required, the bail may be cancelled, and the accused may be arrested again.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Bhagwati Lal, who was in custody for offences under Sections 2, 9, 51 of Protection of Wild Life Act and Section 379 IPC. The accused has been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. These conditions are designed to ensure that the accused appears before the court as required and does not flee or tamper with evidence.
