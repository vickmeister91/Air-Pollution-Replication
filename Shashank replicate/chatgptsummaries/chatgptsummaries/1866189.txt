The Jharkhand High Court recently heard two cases involving the quashing of a criminal case under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The case was filed against two individuals who were allegedly operating industrial units without the consent of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The court was asked to determine whether the case could be prosecuted based on a First Information Report or if it required a complaint made by the Board or an authorized officer.

The court found that the Act did not define the term "complaint" and therefore, the case could be prosecuted based on a First Information Report. However, the court noted that the police must follow the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure when investigating such cases. The court order states that any offense under any law must be investigated according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, subject to the provisions of the special law regulating the investigation. 

The offense in question is punishable for six years, making it a cognizable offense. The police are obligated to reduce the offense into writing and investigate it according to the manner prescribed in subsequent sections. The court also cites previous cases where similar situations were dealt with using the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court concludes that the police are competent to register the case as the offense alleged is cognizable, and the magistrate can take cognizance of the offense on the basis of a complaint filed along with the police report.

The Jharkhand High Court's decision in these cases clarifies the procedure for prosecuting offenses under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's ruling that a First Information Report can be used to prosecute such cases provides a more efficient and streamlined process for law enforcement agencies. However, the court's emphasis on following the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure ensures that the rights of the accused are protected and that investigations are conducted in a fair and just manner.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict enforcement of laws regulating pollution. The Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The court's ruling ensures that those who violate the Act will be held accountable for their actions and that the environment will be protected.

Overall, the Jharkhand High Court's decision in these cases provides clarity on the procedure for prosecuting offenses under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's emphasis on following the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure ensures that investigations are conducted fairly and justly, while its ruling that a First Information Report can be used to prosecute such cases provides a more efficient process for law enforcement agencies. The decision also highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for strict enforcement of laws regulating pollution.
