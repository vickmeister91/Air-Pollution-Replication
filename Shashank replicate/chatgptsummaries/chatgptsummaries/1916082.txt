The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Pius Abraham, who is the fourth accused in a case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused allegedly trespassed into a reserve forest, killed a sambar deer, and sold its meat. While the other accused have already been granted bail, Pius Abraham was not available for arrest. 

The court dismissed the application for anticipatory bail, stating that there were no features in the case that would justify the invocation of the extraordinary equitable discretion under Section 438 Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for anticipatory bail to be granted in certain circumstances, such as when a person has reason to believe that they may be arrested for a non-bailable offence. However, the court found that Pius Abraham did not meet the criteria for anticipatory bail in this case.

The court directed Pius Abraham to surrender before the investigating officer or the learned Magistrate and then seek regular bail in the normal and ordinary course. This means that Pius Abraham will have to surrender himself to the authorities and then apply for bail in the usual manner, rather than being granted anticipatory bail. 

The case in question involves a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, which is aimed at protecting endangered species and their habitats. The killing of a sambar deer and the sale of its meat is a violation of this law, and the accused are facing serious charges as a result. 

While the other accused have already been granted bail, Pius Abraham's application for anticipatory bail was dismissed by the court. This suggests that the court did not find his case to be compelling enough to warrant anticipatory bail, despite the fact that he was not available for arrest at the time of the application. 

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following due process in criminal cases, even when seeking bail. While anticipatory bail can be granted in certain circumstances, it is not a right and must be justified by the specific features of the case. In this instance, the court found that Pius Abraham did not meet the criteria for anticipatory bail and directed him to surrender himself to the authorities and seek regular bail in the usual manner.
