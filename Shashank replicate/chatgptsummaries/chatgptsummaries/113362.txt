Hyderali, who has applied for regular bail after being accused of trespassing into a reserve forest for hunting, under the Kerala Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act.

The case against V.P. Hyderali and his co-accused pertains to their alleged involvement in hunting activities in a reserve forest, which is a violation of the Kerala Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were arrested by the forest officials and were produced before the court. While the co-accused had applied for anticipatory bail, which was dismissed by the court, V.P. Hyderali had applied for regular bail.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, allowed the petition of V.P. Hyderali and directed him to be released on bail subject to certain conditions. The conditions include executing a bond and making himself available for interrogation by the investigating officer. The court also directed V.P. Hyderali to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The decision of the court to grant bail to V.P. Hyderali has been welcomed by his supporters, who have been protesting against his arrest. They have argued that V.P.

They have also claimed that the forest officials have been harassing the local people in the name of protecting the forest.

On the other hand, the decision of the court has been criticized by the environmentalists and wildlife activists, who have argued that the accused should not be granted bail as they have violated the laws meant for protecting the forest and wildlife. They have also argued that the decision of the court may set a wrong precedent and encourage others to indulge in similar activities.

The case of V.P. Hyderali and his co-accused highlights the conflict between the interests of the local people and the need to protect the environment and wildlife.
