The court order pertains to the case of an elephant named Sunder who was being kept in captivity in poor conditions. The court received affidavits and photographs showing the elephant's aggressive behavior and physical injuries from chaining. The court ordered Sunder to be transported to an elephant care and rehabilitation center for immediate enrichment of environment and to avoid further permanent damage to his mental status. The court also noted that elephants are highly cognitive and intelligent animals and that it is in Sunder's best interest to be kept in natural surroundings. The court rejected the argument that Sunder should be retained by the Devasthan or Warananagar Group and upheld the jurisdiction of the State Government to issue directions for the welfare of captive elephants.

The court order involves a writ petition filed by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents regarding the treatment of animals. The respondents include the Chief Wildlife Warden, Ministry of Forests, Rehabilitation & Relief Works, the Chairman of Devasthan Management Committee, and the Central Zoo Authority. Another writ petition was filed by Shri Vinay V. Kore, MLA, against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents regarding the treatment of elephants. The court order lists the lawyers representing each party.

The court order concerns two petitions related to the welfare of an elephant named Sunder in captivity. The first petition seeks to quash ownership certificates and ensure proper upkeep of Sunder, while the second petition seeks to have Sunder released and relocated to a wildlife rescue center. The court heard both petitions and reserved judgment on March 20, 2014, before pronouncing judgment on April 7, 2014. The order provides background information on Sunder's ownership and the complaints of cruel treatment received by the petitioner.

The court order pertains to the mistreatment of an elephant named Sunder at a temple in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. The Animal Welfare Officer filed a complaint under the Wildlife Protection Act alleging that Sunder was kept chained, denied adequate food and water, and had suffered injuries. The court ordered Sunder to be relocated to a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center in Bangalore. However, a Member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly expressed willingness to establish a suitable facility for Sunder's welfare and requested that Sunder be permitted to remain at the temple. The petitioner seeks enforcement of the relocation order and cancellation of the ownership certificate.

The court order pertains to a petition seeking enforcement of an order issued by the Joint Secretary (Forests), Revenue and Forest Department, and quashing of an ownership certificate. The petitioner has taken up the issue of ownership and a complaint is pending before the appropriate authority. The respondent disputes the jurisdiction of the Joint Secretary and denies all allegations of ill-treatment of the elephant. The court has received an assessment report of captive Sunder, which indicates that he is distressed and disturbed due to lack of exercise, persistent chaining, and absence of enrichment in living environment. The court has directed compliance with the order passed by IGF & Director (Project Elephant) and attempts to shift the elephant to Bengaluru have been unsuccessful. The petitioner has filed a further rejoinder stating that Sunder is distressed and disturbed only when his own mahout or assistant mahout approach him, indicating that he is not being treated humanely.

The court order directs that an elephant named Sunder, who has been confined and ill-treated, be transported to a facility in Bengaluru in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court also notes that laws tend to be biased towards humans and that it is the court's duty to ensure balance in the system.
