The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where the principles of natural justice and fair play were violated. In the first case, M/s Dheeraj Enterprises filed a writ petition against the Indore Development Authority for cancelling the lease deed of a plot allotted to the petitioner firm. The petitioner had won the bid in 2003, but the lease deed was executed only in 2017. The respondent had issued a show cause notice for cancellation of the lease deed, alleging the existence of a liquor shop and buses parked on the plot. The petitioner denied the allegations, but the lease deed was cancelled without granting an opportunity of personal hearing. The petitioner prayed for quashing of the impugned order passed by the respondent. The court disposed of the matter with the consent of the parties at the admission stage itself.

In the second case, a lease deed was cancelled by the respondent, claiming that the petitioner had violated the terms and conditions of the lease. However, the petitioner denied the allegations and challenged the cancellation of the lease deed. The court found that the respondent had acted in an illegal and arbitrary manner and had violated the principles of natural justice and fair play. The court quashed the impugned order and held that the third party could not be permitted to intervene in the dispute between the lessee and lessor. The court cited previous cases to support its decision.

The third court order transfers a civil suit to a different court to be tried alongside another suit. The court cites a previous case to support the plaintiff's right to not add parties to the suit. The court also references several judgments to argue that the cancellation of the plaintiff's lease was done without following principles of natural justice and fairness. The court emphasizes the importance of adhering to principles of natural justice, including the right to be heard and the right to an impartial judge.

The fourth court order discusses the importance of natural justice in legal proceedings, which includes the principles of "nemo judex in causa sua" (no one shall be a judge in their own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The order emphasizes that administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies must follow these principles while making decisions that affect individuals' rights. The order also cites various definitions of natural justice and explains that it is a fundamental aspect of a civilized society. The order concludes that even if all facts are not admitted or beyond dispute, natural justice must be upheld in legal proceedings.

The fifth court order discusses the issue of breach of natural justice and whether relief can be refused even if the court thinks the case of the applicant is not one of 'real substance' or that there is no substantial possibility of success. The court notes that natural justice is the essence of fair adjudication and is firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court finds that there was a violation of principles of natural justice and fair play in the present case and quashes the impugned order passed by the respondents. The writ petition is allowed with a cost of Rs.50,000/- to be paid to the petitioner within a period of 30 days.

In conclusion, all of these court orders emphasize the importance of natural justice and fair play in legal proceedings. They highlight the need for administrative agencies and quasi-judicial bodies to follow these principles while making decisions that affect individuals' rights. The court orders also cite previous cases to support their decisions and emphasize the fundamental aspect of natural justice in a civilized society.
