The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by S. Purnachandra Rao and S. Rajesh Kiran challenging an order passed by the IX Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad, granting permission to the police to investigate non-cognizable offenses under Sections 504, 506, and 120-B IPC. The petitioners sought quashing of the order on the ground that it was passed without application of mind.

The court examined the requirement of giving reasons while directing the police to investigate non-cognizable offenses and held that while it is not necessary to pass a reasoned order, the Magistrate should give some reasons for passing the order. The court rejected the argument that reasons are to be recorded only when the Court refuses to give permission to register a crime.

The court order discusses the power of police officers to investigate cognizable cases and the role of magistrates in granting permission for such investigations. The order emphasizes the importance of magistrates providing reasons for their orders, as this is necessary for proper administration of justice and to prevent misuse of power by police officers.

The order also discusses the distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable offenses and the need for magistrates to apply their minds to the facts of the case before granting permission for investigation. The court held that the Magistrate must apply his mind to the facts of the case and record reasons for granting permission to investigate non-cognizable offenses. The court further held that the Magistrate must ensure that the investigation is not a mere fishing expedition and that there is some material on record to justify the investigation.

The court also discussed the scope of interference by the High Court in such matters. The court held that the High Court can interfere with the order of the Magistrate only if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, or perverse. The court further held that the High Court cannot substitute its own opinion for that of the Magistrate.

The court ultimately sets aside the order granting permission for investigation and remands the matter back to the magistrate for further consideration. The court held that the Magistrate must apply his mind to the facts of the case and record reasons for granting permission to investigate non-cognizable offenses. The court further held that the Magistrate must ensure that the investigation is not a mere fishing expedition and that there is some material on record to justify the investigation.

In conclusion, the court order emphasizes the importance of magistrates providing reasons for their orders while granting permission for investigation of non-cognizable offenses. The court also highlights the need for magistrates to apply their minds to the facts of the case before granting permission for investigation and to ensure that the investigation is not a mere fishing expedition. The court's decision to set aside the order granting permission for investigation and remand the matter back to the magistrate for further consideration is a reminder of the importance of proper administration of justice and the need to prevent misuse of power by police officers.
