The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by K. Balamurugan and others seeking a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents not to interfere with the landscape of Mundiyambakkam lake in Villupuram District and protect it from any development or construction activities. The State Government had issued a G.O. for the establishment of a medical college in the area, which the petitioners opposed. The District Collector filed a counter affidavit stating that the land was barren and unutilized, and had not received water for over 15 years, making it suitable for the medical college. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a proposed medical college and hospital to be built on a site that includes a lake. The counter-affidavit argues that the site is suitable for the construction and that the establishment of the college and hospital would benefit the public more than leaving the land unused. The court appointed a committee to inspect the site and report on the presence of water in the lake. The report found no water in the lake, and the court heard arguments from both sides regarding the establishment of the medical college and hospital on the site. The court referred to previous decisions on sustainable development and environmental protection and ultimately issued directions for the protection of the environment.

The court order discusses various Supreme Court decisions related to environmental protection and sustainable development. The court emphasizes that natural resources such as lakes, forests, and wildlife are held by the state as a trustee of the public and can only be disposed of in a manner consistent with the nature of such a trust. The court also stresses the need to strike a balance between sustainable development and environmental protection. The court applies these principles to a case involving the proposed location of a medical college in Villupuram District, stating that the proposed site, a disused lake, is suitable for the college and hospital and that efforts to locate alternative land were not fruitful.

The court order discusses objections raised against the construction of a medical college and hospital on the site of Mundiambakkam lake in Villupuram, India. The court ultimately upholds the government's decision to establish the medical facility on the site, citing the fact that the lake has not held water for over 15 years and has become overgrown with vegetation. The court also orders strict pollution control measures and the implementation of rainwater harvesting and artificial percolation systems to address concerns about groundwater depletion.

The court order upholds changes made in revenue records and directs the 7th respondent to ensure pollution control measures are followed for the proposed construction of a medical college and hospital. The order also directs various respondents to comply with rules and regulations related to biomedical waste management and maintenance of surrounding lakes. A committee of experts is to be constituted to improve ground water bed levels and maintain ecological balance. The third and sixth respondents are directed to file an affidavit within two weeks, outlining their compliance with the directions given in the order.
