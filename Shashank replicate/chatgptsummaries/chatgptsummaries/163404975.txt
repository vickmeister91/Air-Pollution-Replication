The High Court of Himachal Pradesh received a complaint about the illicit felling of green Khair trees in government forest land in Una District. The court took suo motu cognizance and appointed an advocate as Amicus Curiae to assist in the matter. The contractors were found to have committed an offense of illicit felling of trees on government land, in contravention of the Indian Forests Act and Forest Conservation Act. The court referred to the guidelines given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad and Ors. Vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors. and directed the State to act in accordance with them. The State had filed a reply stating that an inquiry had been conducted and action had been taken against the forest officials and contractors. An FIR had been registered against the contractors, and the permit of one contractor had been canceled.

The court order requires the Forest Department to ensure that videography is done before, during, and after felling trees, with specific requirements for Khair, Chil Pine, and Sal trees. The state must also ensure adequate funds for reforestation and protection of the forest areas. The program will be supervised by a two-member committee. The court is satisfied with the government's compliance with the order and closes the matter, with a direction to follow up on FIRs and inquiry reports. The Amicus Curiae is awarded Rs. 10,000 for their services.
