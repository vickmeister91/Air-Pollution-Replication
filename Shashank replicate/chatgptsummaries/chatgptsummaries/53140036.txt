The court order in question pertains to a writ application filed by Lextan India against CESC Ltd. The petitioner had sought a direction to restore electricity supply to their factory, which had been disconnected by the respondent/corporation on February 11, 2004. During the pendency of the writ application, an inspection revealed that the factory was a tannery, and the respondent/corporation cited a Supreme Court decision that electricity connections in a tannery in the area in question could not be restored. The court dismissed the writ application, stating that no direction for restoration of electricity supply could be given in view of the Supreme Court decision.

The case began when Lextan India filed a writ application against CESC Ltd. seeking a direction to restore electricity supply to their factory. The petitioner claimed that the electricity supply had been disconnected by the respondent/corporation on February 11, 2004, without any prior notice or intimation. The petitioner further claimed that the disconnection of electricity supply had caused them immense financial losses and had adversely affected their business operations.

During the pendency of the writ application, an inspection was conducted by the respondent/corporation, which revealed that the factory was a tannery. The respondent/corporation cited a Supreme Court decision that electricity connections in a tannery in the area in question could not be restored. The respondent/corporation argued that the disconnection of electricity supply was in compliance with the Supreme Court decision and that no direction for restoration of electricity supply could be given.

The petitioner, on the other hand, argued that the Supreme Court decision cited by the respondent/corporation was not applicable to their case. The petitioner claimed that their factory was not a tannery but a leather goods manufacturing unit, and therefore, the Supreme Court decision did not apply to them. The petitioner further argued that the disconnection of electricity supply had been done without any prior notice or intimation, which was a violation of their fundamental rights.

The court, after hearing both parties, dismissed the writ application filed by Lextan India. The court held that no direction for restoration of electricity supply could be given in view of the Supreme Court decision cited by the respondent/corporation. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to prove that their factory was not a tannery and that the disconnection of electricity supply had been done without any prior notice or intimation. The court further held that the petitioner had not made out a case for violation of their fundamental rights.

The court's decision was based on the Supreme Court decision cited by the respondent/corporation, which stated that electricity connections in a tannery in the area in question could not be restored. The court held that the petitioner had failed to prove that their factory was not a tannery and that the Supreme Court decision cited by the respondent/corporation was applicable to their case. The court further held that the disconnection of electricity supply had been done in compliance with the Supreme Court decision and that no direction for restoration of electricity supply could be given.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ application filed by Lextan India against CESC Ltd. seeking a direction to restore electricity supply to their factory. The court dismissed the writ application, stating that no direction for restoration of electricity supply could be given in view of the Supreme Court decision cited by the respondent/corporation.
