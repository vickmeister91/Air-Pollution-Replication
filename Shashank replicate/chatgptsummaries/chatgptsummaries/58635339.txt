The Himachal Pradesh High Court issued a series of orders on March 11, 2020, pertaining to various cases related to the regulation of stone crushers and the jurisdiction of different courts and tribunals. The orders provide clarity on the powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the role of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in matters related to service and recruitment of members of All-India Services, civil services, defense services, and civilians appointed to government or government-controlled entities.

In one of the orders, the court clarified that the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts against military or armed forces disputes, but such powers must be exercised restrictively and on limited grounds. The court also emphasized that the jurisdiction under Article 226 cannot be circumscribed by any enactment and must be zealously protected. The court suggested that direct appeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals should be revisited and appeals to Division Benches of High Courts should be provided instead.

Another order pertained to the regulation of stone crushers in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The State Pollution Control Board had directed a stone crusher unit to stop its operation due to violation of distance norms from a water body. However, consent to operate was later granted. The court referred to a notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which prohibits the location of a stone crusher within 100 meters of springs, canals, reservoirs, or functional water supply schemes, including natural water springs. The court clarified that the notification includes rivulets of perennial nature but cannot be read as excluding non-perennial water bodies. The court quashed the consent to operate granted to any stone crusher within 100 meters of a water body and directed the Pollution Control Board to take steps to stop their operation. The State filed a review petition against this order, which was also dismissed.

In another order, the court directed the Union to undertake an exercise to increase affordability of justice and provide High Court judges with adequate experience before coming to the Supreme Court. The court also has jurisdiction to pass an interim order and modify it. The interim order in question pertained to the prohibition of 100 meters for stone crushers in Himachal Pradesh. The court examined the legality of the operations of stone crushers in the state and directed a joint inspection to verify the same. The court also noted that the stone crushers were operating without the requisite consents and illegal mining was taking place.

The court also discussed the regulation of stone crushers in the vicinity of water bodies in Himachal Pradesh. The court has ordered a minimum distance of 100 meters from springs, canals, reservoirs, and functional water supply schemes, including their reservoirs, and a minimum distance of 500 meters from lakes, wetlands, and reservoirs of irrigation schemes and hydro power projects. The court has also ruled that non-perennial water bodies cannot be excluded from the regulatory regime under the Notification. The State of Himachal Pradesh and representative of Stone Crushers have appealed to the court to modify the distance of 100 meters from non-perennial rivulets. The court has granted them liberty to move the Tribunal either by way of review or for a suitable modification of the order on the merits.

The court rejected the argument that only perennial water bodies need to be protected and sought expert opinion on the matter. The expert committee recommended that the distance norm of 100 meters should be uniformly applied to all streams, and no mining/extraction activities should be carried out on first order non-perennial streams. The court refused to review or modify the earlier view that non-perennial water bodies are not covered by the prohibition of location of stone crushers within 100 meters.

In another order, the court discussed the recommendations made by a Joint Expert Committee regarding the location and operation of stone crusher units near streams. The committee recommends that a distance norm of 100m be applied uniformly to all streams, and that no mining/extraction activities be carried out on first order non-perennial streams. However, small first order streams with steep gradients may be exempted from the distance norm subject to additional precautionary measures. The court order makes the interim order passed in CMP No. 8459 of 2019 absolute, subject to certain directions, including the use of state-of-the-art technology and adherence to international protocols.

Finally, the court ordered that any construction in the area must not disrupt traffic flow or cause traffic jams, and there must be sufficient parking space for trucks. Two applications, CMP No. 8459 of 2019 and CMP No. 15351 of 2019 in CWP No. 4342 of 2019, have been disposed of and no further orders are required. The petitioners/applicants may file a new application if they seek further relief. 

Overall, the orders provide clarity on the powers of different courts and tribunals and the regulation of stone crushers in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The court has emphasized the importance of protecting the jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution of India and ensuring that the regulatory regime for stone crushers is applied uniformly to all water bodies, including non-perennial ones. The court has also directed the Union to take steps to increase affordability of justice and provide High Court judges with adequate experience before coming to the Supreme Court.
