The Delhi High Court recently passed a court order in a criminal revision petition filed by M/s Shoppers Stop Ltd. against the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. The petition challenged the summoning order issued by the trial court for offenses punishable under the Environment Protection Act. The petitioner argued that the complaint filed before the trial court was not authorized and that the lifting of samples by the respondent committee was not done in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act.

The court, however, dismissed this argument, stating that the complaint was filed by a duly authorized person and that the objections raised by the petitioner were without merit.
