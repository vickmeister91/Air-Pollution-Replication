The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri. Manjunath Ganapati Bhat against the Principal Secretary, Department of Forest, Government of Karnataka, and others. The petitioner had constructed a residential house in a reserved forest area, which is in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Karnataka Forest Act. 

The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief against the order passed by the respondent, which directed the petitioner to demolish the residential house constructed in the reserved forest area. The petitioner had argued that the construction of the house was not in violation of any law and that the order passed by the respondent was arbitrary and illegal.

The court granted an interim order staying the execution and operation of the order passed by the respondent until the next date of hearing. The petitioner was allowed to continue residing in the house until the matter was finally decided by the court. 

However, the court later vacated the interim order and dismissed the petition, reserving liberty to the petitioner to approach the appropriate forum/court if he is aggrieved. The court held that the construction of the residential house in the reserved forest area was in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Karnataka Forest Act. The court also noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities before constructing the house.

The court observed that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, was enacted to protect the forests and wildlife in the country and to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The court noted that the Act prohibits any non-forestry activity in a reserved forest area without the prior approval of the Central Government. The court also observed that the Karnataka Forest Act provides for the protection, conservation, and management of forests in the state and prohibits any unauthorized occupation or use of forest land.

The court held that the construction of the residential house in the reserved forest area was a clear violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Karnataka Forest Act. The court noted that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities before constructing the house. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any efforts to rectify the violation and had continued to reside in the house despite the order passed by the respondent.

In conclusion, the court order in question dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner and upheld the order passed by the respondent directing the petitioner to demolish the residential house constructed in the reserved forest area. The court held that the construction of the house was in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Karnataka Forest Act and that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities before constructing the house. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any efforts to rectify the violation and had continued to reside in the house despite the order passed by the respondent.
