The Madras High Court recently heard three writ petitions related to the Loss of Ecology Authority (LoEA), which was constituted by the Central Government under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, to entertain claim petitions from farmers seeking compensation for damage caused to their agricultural fields. The court disposed of one writ petition, directing the Union of India to nominate a chairman for the Authority within one month and provide necessary facilities to make it functional. However, the Union of India sought a modification of the order, stating that the Authority was no longer necessary or feasible after the constitution of the National Green Tribunal.

The court heard arguments from both sides and decided to consider whether the Authority should be constituted as a permanent body or whether its functions and powers should be transferred to the National Green Tribunal. The LoEA was created by an order of the Supreme Court in 1996 to deal with pollution caused by tanneries and other industries in Tamil Nadu. The Central Government argues that the National Green Tribunal can effectively discharge the functions and powers of the LoEA, while environmentalists argue that the LoEA should not be made redundant as it was created by a Supreme Court order and has distinguishing features from the National Green Tribunal.

The court order discusses the differences between the LoEA and the National Green Tribunal, including the LoEA's power to take suo motu cognizance of environmental degradation in Tamil Nadu and award compensation without a court fee or time limitation, as well as its ability to take samples and analyze pollution. The LoEA also has the power to frame reversal schemes and credit compensation to an Environment Protection Fund, while the National Green Tribunal credits compensation to an Environment Relief Fund. The National Green Tribunal has both original and appellate jurisdiction and the power to grant relief and compensation to victims of pollution, order restitution of property or the environment, and punish non-compliance with imprisonment or fines. The court also provides historical context on the development of environmental protection laws in India.

The court order proposes the creation of special courts, like the Consumer fora, for speedy and specialist resolution of environmental disputes. The proposed court will not be bound by rules of evidence and can lay down its procedure, but must observe principles of natural justice. The court must apply the fundamental principles of environmental law and keep in mind the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays Principle, New Burden of Proof Principle, Prevention Principle, Strict Liability, Public Trust doctrine, Concept of intergenerational equity and the Concept of Sustainable Development. The court must have power to frame schemes and monitor them and also have power to modify the schemes from time to time. The court must have power to execute its orders as decrees of civil courts and should also be able to exercise contempt jurisdiction. The court should have power to grant any other relief other than what is sought for, which is suitable in facts and circumstances of the case. The court must have a wide locus standi before it in original petitions. The court must be assisted by a statutory panel of Technical/Scientific personnel called Commissioners. The court will be manned each by three members with judicial or legal experience as stated and an appeal against the judgment shall be to the Supreme Court of India.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted to provide for the establishment of the National Green Tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of civil cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources including enforcement of any legal right relating to environment. The LoEA was created pursuant to the directions issued by the Supreme Court, but it is not permissible for this court to make it redundant. The LoEA was not created by a statute so as to be repealed by an enactment creating another Tribunal in the place of the same. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 prescribed a fixed court fee and a limitation period for filing claims. The Tribunal can compel any expert to take samples and have them analysed, before submitting a report. The court can frame reversal schemes and send the same to the State Government for implementation. The court can entertain class action in tort.

The court order dismisses the contention that a class action in tort is permissible before the LoEA and not feasible before the National Green Tribunal. The court also states that the LoEA was constituted due to the special needs of the State of Tamil Nadu, but it does not mean that an All India Tribunal cannot deal with the issues that the LoEA was called upon to deal with. The court concludes that the powers and functions of the LoEA can be effectively discharged by the National Green Tribunal, subject to certain safeguards. The court orders that all claims pending investigation/enquiry on the file of the LoEA shall stand transferred to the Chennai Bench of the National Green Tribunal, and the Union of India shall consider rehabilitating the employees of the LoEA by absorbing them into the National Green Tribunal. The court also directs W.P.No.13433 of 1996 to be transferred to the file of the National Green Tribunal.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court has considered the issue of the Loss of Ecology Authority and its functions and powers in relation to the National Green Tribunal. The court has proposed the creation of special courts for speedy and specialist resolution of environmental disputes and has ordered the transfer of pending claims to the National Green Tribunal. The court has also directed the Union of India to nominate a chairman for the Authority within one month and provide necessary facilities to make it functional. The court has dismissed the contention that a class action in tort is permissible before
