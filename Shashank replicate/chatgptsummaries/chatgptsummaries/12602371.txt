The recent court order pertains to a case involving the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation and the Union of India regarding the construction of a road through a forest area. The court notes that permission was granted under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) 2011 with the condition that a road on stilts be constructed in the mangrove area, with a limited area of mangroves to be destroyed.

The court has ordered that no more trees be felled in the area where permission was granted under CRZ-2011 until the next hearing, which is scheduled for four weeks later. This decision has been welcomed by environmentalists and activists who have been fighting against the destruction of forests and mangroves in the area.
