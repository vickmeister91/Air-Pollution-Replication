The court recently heard an application for condonation of delay in filing an application under Section 378(4) of the Cr.P.C. The delay in question was reported to be a staggering 1755 days. The case in question involved a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the respondent, which had been dismissed by the trial court. 

The applicant had filed a restoration application, a revision, and an application under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. within the prescribed period of limitation. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the applicant was unable to file the application for leave to appeal within the stipulated time frame. 

The court was tasked with deciding whether to allow the application for condonation of delay and grant time for arguments on the point of grant of leave to appeal to the applicant. 

After considering the facts of the case and the reasons for the delay, the court ultimately allowed the application for condonation of delay. The court recognized that the applicant had taken all necessary steps within the prescribed period of limitation and that the delay in filing the application for leave to appeal was due to unforeseen circumstances. 

The court also noted that the respondent had not been prejudiced by the delay and that the delay did not affect the merits of the case. As such, the court granted time for arguments on the point of grant of leave to appeal to the applicant. 

This case highlights the importance of adhering to prescribed time frames in legal proceedings. However, it also demonstrates that the court is willing to consider unforeseen circumstances and grant condonation of delay in certain situations. Ultimately, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the interests of justice.
