The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Afsar Pasha and Manjunath against Anwar. The petitioners sought to transfer the case against them from the court of SR.C.J. and J.M.F.C., Chintamani to the court of PRL.C.J. and J.M.F.C., Chintamani, Chikkaballapura district. The reason for this request was that the trial judge had hurried with the case on a day-to-day basis and posted it for orders on 4.9.2015, which prompted the complainant to approach the district court for transfer of the case to another court.

The court noted the concerns raised by the petitioners and allowed the petition, quashing the order of the district court and directing the proceedings to continue before the Principal Civil Judge and J.M.F.C., Chintamani. The court also directed the presiding officer to consider the application filed by the complainant and dispose of it in accordance with the law.

The decision of the court was based on the principle of fair trial, which is a fundamental right guaranteed to every citizen under the Indian Constitution. The court recognized that the trial judge had rushed through the case, which could have potentially compromised the fairness of the trial. By allowing the transfer of the case to another court, the court ensured that the trial would be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of the role of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served. The court recognized that the complainant had a legitimate concern about the fairness of the trial and took appropriate action to address those concerns.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of the judiciary in ensuring that the rights of citizens are protected and that justice is served. It also highlights the need for judges to conduct trials in a fair and impartial manner, without rushing through the proceedings. By upholding these principles, the court has helped to strengthen the rule of law and promote justice in society.
