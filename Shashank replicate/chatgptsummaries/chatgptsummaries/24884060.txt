The Karnataka High Court received a writ petition from Nitesh Residency Hotels Pvt Ltd against The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioners requested the court to quash a complaint and order of summons issued against them for running a hotel without proper consent under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The complaint also accused the petitioners of causing noise pollution by exceeding the standards prescribed in Schedule III of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The court ordered that the petitioners were accused of running the hotel without proper consent and causing noise pollution.

The court order states that the accused hotel has violated the provisions of Section 21 of the Air Act by operating electrical equipment without obtaining consent for operation. The hotel has also generated noise pollution from its kitchen exhaust fans, which has exceeded the permissible noise levels for residential areas. The court has inspected the hotel and found that the noise levels were exceeding the standard prescribed for residential areas. The accused hotel has also failed to renew its consent for operation under the Water Act, 1974, and has committed an offense punishable under Section 44 thereof. The court has heard arguments from both sides and has not yet made a decision on whether to quash the complaint filed against the accused hotel.

The court order discusses the seriousness of pollution and the responsibility of those who discharge harmful effluents into streams. It also refers to section 25 of the Water Act 1974, which requires consent for establishing or operating industries that may discharge sewage or trade effluent into a stream or well. The court found that the petitioners had operated a sewage treatment plant without the requisite consent and had violated section 25 of the Water Act. The contention that there was a deemed consent due to the pending application for renewal was not accepted.

The court order discusses a case involving violations of the Water Act 1974 and the Air Act 1981 by the petitioners who were operating a hotel without necessary consent. The court found that the petitioners violated section 25 of the Water Act 1974 but did not violate section 22 of the Air Act 1981. The order quashes the previous order of taking cognizance by the learned Magistrate and remits the matter to the learned Magistrate to reconsider the matter afresh from the stage of taking cognizance.
