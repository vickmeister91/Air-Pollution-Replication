The court order in question pertains to a dispute over a mining lease for the extraction of red oxide of iron ore in a particular area. The lease had expired, and the appellant had applied for renewal, which was not granted by the State Government. The appellant then filed a writ petition in the High Court, which directed the State Government to dispose of the application. However, the State Government had already notified the entire area as available for a new mining lease, and 61 applications were made to the State Government.

The court order sets aside the order recalling the writ petition and directs the State Government to consider all applications for a fresh grant of mining lease on merits, excluding forest areas. The State Government is directed to dispose of the pending applications within four months.
