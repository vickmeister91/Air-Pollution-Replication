The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by workmen of Hindustan Vegetables Oils Corporation, challenging the decision of the Labour Court to deny them six years' wages as additional compensation based on their last drawn wages in 2000 when their services were retrenched. The workmen had argued that the compensation should be calculated on the basis of their last drawn wages as on the date of retrenchment, which was in 2000. However, the Labour Court had ruled that the compensation had to be calculated on the basis of last drawn wages as on 30th November 1996, as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in MC Mehta v. UOI.

The workmen had contended that the Labour Court's decision was unfair and arbitrary, as it denied them the benefit of the increase in wages that had taken place between 1996 and 2000. They had also argued that the Labour Court had misinterpreted the Supreme Court's direction in MC Mehta v. UOI, which had only laid down a minimum standard for calculating compensation and had not precluded the use of a higher standard.

However, the court dismissed the writ petition, stating that the Labour Court's decision was in line with the Hon'ble Supreme Court's direction and that it was not open to the Labour Court or any other court to enlarge the direction given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The court observed that the Supreme Court had clearly directed that the compensation should be calculated on the basis of last drawn wages as on 30th November 1996, and that this direction had to be followed by all courts.

The court also rejected the workmen's argument that the Labour Court had misinterpreted the Supreme Court's direction in MC Mehta v. UOI. The court observed that the Supreme Court had clearly laid down a minimum standard for calculating compensation, and that the Labour Court had correctly applied this standard in the present case.

The court's decision has important implications for the calculation of compensation in cases of retrenchment. It reaffirms the principle that compensation should be calculated on the basis of last drawn wages as on the date of retrenchment, subject to a minimum standard laid down by the Supreme Court. It also underscores the importance of following the Supreme Court's directions in such cases, and the limited scope for courts to deviate from these directions.

Overall, the court's decision is a reminder of the importance of clarity and consistency in the application of legal principles, particularly in cases involving the rights of workers. It highlights the need for courts to carefully consider the facts and legal principles involved in each case, and to apply these principles in a manner that is fair and consistent with the law.
