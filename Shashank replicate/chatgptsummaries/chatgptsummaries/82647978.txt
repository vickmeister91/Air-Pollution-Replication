In a recent court order, the petition filed by Janak Mandal to quash criminal proceedings against him for offences under the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act was disposed of by the court. The court noted that the case had already been disposed of by the lower court and therefore, the petition was disposed of.

The Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act are two important pieces of legislation that govern the management and conservation of forests in India. The Indian Forest Act was enacted in 1927 and provides for the protection of forests and the regulation of forest produce. The Forest (Conservation) Act was enacted in 1980 and provides for the conservation of forests and the prevention of deforestation.

Janak Mandal's case pertained to offences under these two Acts. It is not clear from the court order what specific offences he was charged with, but it is likely that they related to the illegal felling of trees or the illegal possession of forest produce.

The court order notes that the case had already been disposed of by the lower court. It is not clear from the order what the outcome of the lower court proceedings was, but it is likely that Janak Mandal was either acquitted or convicted and had appealed the decision.

In any case, the court order disposed of the petition filed by Janak Mandal to quash the criminal proceedings against him. This means that the criminal proceedings will continue and Janak Mandal will have to face trial for the offences he has been charged with.

The disposal of the petition by the court is not surprising, as it is generally difficult to get criminal proceedings quashed. The courts are usually reluctant to interfere with ongoing criminal proceedings, as they are considered to be in the public interest.

Overall, the court order in Janak Mandal's case is a reminder of the importance of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act in the conservation and management of forests in India. It also highlights the difficulties faced by those who are charged with offences under these Acts, as criminal proceedings are often difficult to quash.
