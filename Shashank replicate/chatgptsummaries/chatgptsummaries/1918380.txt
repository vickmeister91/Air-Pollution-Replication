The court has issued two orders pertaining to environmental protection. The first order is in response to a public interest petition seeking directions to cinema halls and exhibition halls to exhibit slides containing information and messages on the environment free of cost. The court has directed the central and state governments to enforce this as a condition of the license of all cinema halls, touring cinemas, and video parlors. The Ministry of Environment has been directed to come out with appropriate slide material on various aspects of environment and pollution. The court has also directed the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to start producing information films on environment and pollution and to exhibit them on national networks, state door darshan centers, All India Radio, and television. The court has further directed that environment should be made a compulsory subject in schools and colleges in a graded system.

The second order directs the Central and State Governments to ensure compliance with environmental protection measures from February 1, 1992. The court suggests that the All India Radio and Doordarshan should broadcast educational programs on environmental protection. The court accepts that environmental education should be taught as a compulsory subject and directs the University Grants Commission to take appropriate steps to make it so. The court requires every State Government and Education Board to enforce compulsory education on the environment up to the college level. The court concludes that protecting the environment is necessary for life to survive on earth and disposes of the matter with the given directions.

The court's orders are significant as they recognize the importance of environmental protection and the need for education and awareness on the subject. The first order is particularly noteworthy as it mandates the display of environmental information in cinema halls and exhibition halls, which are frequented by a large number of people. This will help in spreading awareness on environmental issues to a wider audience. The order also directs the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to produce material on environment and pollution, which can be used for educational purposes.

The second order focuses on ensuring compliance with environmental protection measures and making environmental education a compulsory subject. The court recognizes that environmental education is essential for creating a sustainable future and directs the University Grants Commission and Education Boards to take appropriate steps to make it a compulsory subject. This will help in creating a generation of environmentally conscious citizens who can contribute towards protecting the environment.

Overall, the court's orders are a step in the right direction towards environmental protection and education. The orders recognize the importance of creating awareness and education on environmental issues and provide a framework for achieving this. It is now up to the central and state governments, as well as educational institutions, to ensure that these orders are implemented effectively. By doing so, we can create a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.
