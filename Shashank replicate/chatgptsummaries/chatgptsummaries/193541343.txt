The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by M/S Omaxe Ltd and others seeking the quashing of a complaint case filed against them by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board under the Environment Protection Act. The petitioners argued that they already had an Environment Clearance Certificate and therefore the complaint was bad in law. The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint case and all subsequent proceedings arising from it.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate, which is a legal requirement for any project that has the potential to cause environmental damage. The certificate is issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests after a thorough assessment of the potential environmental impact of the project. Once the certificate is issued, the project is deemed to be in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations.

The court noted that the complaint filed by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was based on the allegation that the petitioners had violated certain environmental laws and regulations. However, since the petitioners had already obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate, they were deemed to be in compliance with all such laws and regulations. Therefore, the complaint was bad in law and the court quashed it.

The court also referred to a previous order passed in a similar case and disposed of the petition in the same terms. This previous order had held that once an Environment Clearance Certificate is obtained, the project is deemed to be in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations. Therefore, any complaint filed against the project on the basis of environmental violations is bad in law.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reinforces the importance of obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate before undertaking any project that has the potential to cause environmental damage. It also provides clarity on the legal status of such certificates and their role in ensuring compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

In conclusion, the court order in this case quashed a complaint filed against the petitioners by the Regional Officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board on the basis of an Environment Clearance Certificate obtained by the petitioners. The court held that once such a certificate is obtained, the project is deemed to be in compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, and any complaint filed against it on the basis of environmental violations is bad in law. The court's decision reinforces the importance of obtaining such certificates and their role in ensuring compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
