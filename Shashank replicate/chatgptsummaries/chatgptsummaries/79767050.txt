The court order pertains to two cases where the principles of natural justice were at the forefront of the proceedings. In the first case, Smt. Nirmala had filed a petition against her termination by the Women and Child Welfare department. The petitioner claimed that her services were terminated without any inquiry or participation from her end, despite having worked for almost 17 years with sincerity and devotion. The respondents, on the other hand, claimed to have given multiple show cause notices to the petitioner and conducted an inquiry before terminating her services.

The court order extensively quoted the principles of natural justice and emphasized the importance of following them in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court criticized the 'useless formality theory' and emphasized that natural justice is deeply rooted in tradition and conscience. The court also noted that the principles of natural justice are firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The two basic principles of natural justice are "nemo judex in causa sua" (no one shall be a judge in their own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The court discussed how these principles have evolved over time and how they ensure fairness in judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative processes.

The petitioner's counsel cited a previous judgment in a similar case where the termination order was set aside due to a violation of natural justice principles. The court order emphasized the importance of following natural justice principles in fair adjudication and noted that they are firmly grounded in the Constitution of India.

In the first case, the court quashed the impugned order and allowed the writ petition, entitling the petitioner to backwages and all consequential benefits. The court also directed the respondents to ensure payment of arrears of salary and payment of regular salary.

In the second case, the court set aside the termination order and directed the respondents to reinstate the petitioner in the service forthwith and pay 50% of backwages/emolument.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of natural justice in ensuring fairness in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court emphasized that natural justice is deeply rooted in tradition and conscience and is firmly grounded in the Constitution of India. The court's decision to quash the impugned order and allow the writ petition in the first case and to set aside the termination order and direct the respondents to reinstate the petitioner in the second case shows the court's commitment to upholding natural justice principles.
