The court order pertains to a case where multiple interlocutory applications have been filed for various reasons. The first application is for deleting the name of the appellant who died during the pendency of the appeal and substituting it with the name of her legal heirs/representatives. The court allows the application and orders the names of the legal heirs/representatives to be brought on record. This is a common practice in legal proceedings where a party to the case passes away and their legal heirs or representatives need to be substituted in their place.

Another interlocutory application has been filed for condoning the delay in preferring the present appeal, which the court allows. This means that the appellant had missed the deadline for filing the appeal and was seeking an extension of time to file it. The court has granted this extension and allowed the appeal to proceed.

The court also orders a stay on the further proceeding in Title Suit No.25 of 1998 pending in the court of Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Jamshedpur. This means that the proceedings in another case, which may be related to the present case, have been put on hold until the present case is resolved.

The court allows another interlocutory application for substitution of legal heirs/representatives of the respondent who died during the pendency of the appeal. This is similar to the first application, but in this case, it is the respondent who has passed away and their legal heirs or representatives need to be substituted in their place.

The court also allows an interlocutory application for condoning the delay in preferring the present appeal. This is the same as the second application mentioned earlier, but in this case, it is the respondent who had missed the deadline for filing the appeal and was seeking an extension of time to file it.

Finally, the cases are listed for admission on 05.07.2017. This means that the cases will be heard by the court on this date and the parties involved will have an opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.

In summary, the court order deals with multiple interlocutory applications filed in a case where parties have passed away and their legal heirs or representatives need to be substituted in their place. The court has allowed these applications and granted extensions of time for filing the appeal. The proceedings in another related case have been put on hold until the present case is resolved. The cases are listed for admission on a future date.
