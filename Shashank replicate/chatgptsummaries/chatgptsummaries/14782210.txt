The court order in question pertains to a criminal misc. petition filed by Yogesh Singh against Dinesh Singh, also known as Dinesh Kumar Singh. The petition challenges the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, rejecting the application filed by the accused-petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. praying that an order should be passed for summoning income tax returns of witness Surendra Singh. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the trial court was justified in rejecting the application, and the petition was devoid of merit. The stay application filed by the petitioner was also dismissed.

To understand the court order in detail, it is important to first understand the background of the case. Yogesh Singh had filed a criminal complaint against Dinesh Singh, accusing him of cheating and forgery. During the course of the trial, Dinesh Singh had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), requesting the court to summon the income tax returns of witness Surendra Singh. The application was rejected by the learned Judicial Magistrate, which prompted Dinesh Singh to file a criminal misc. petition challenging the order.

In the petition, Dinesh Singh argued that the income tax returns of Surendra Singh were relevant to the case and could help establish his innocence. He further contended that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. without giving any reasons. Yogesh Singh, on the other hand, opposed the petition, stating that the application was rightly rejected by the trial court as it was not maintainable.

The court, after hearing both parties, dismissed the petition, stating that the trial court was justified in rejecting the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court observed that the application was devoid of merit and did not disclose any cogent reasons for summoning the income tax returns of Surendra Singh. The court further noted that the trial court had given sufficient reasons for rejecting the application, and there was no infirmity in its order.

The court also rejected the stay application filed by Dinesh Singh, stating that there was no merit in the petition and the trial court's order did not cause any irreparable loss or injury to the petitioner. The court observed that the trial court was competent to decide on the admissibility of evidence and the relevance of income tax returns, and its decision could not be interfered with unless it was shown to be perverse or arbitrary.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal misc. petition filed by Dinesh Singh challenging the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the trial court was justified in rejecting the application, and the petition was devoid of merit. The court also rejected the stay application filed by Dinesh Singh, stating that there was no merit in the petition and the trial court's order did not cause any irreparable loss or injury to the petitioner. The court's decision reaffirms the principle that trial courts are competent to decide on the admissibility of evidence and the relevance of documents, and their decisions should not be interfered with unless they are shown to be perverse or arbitrary.
