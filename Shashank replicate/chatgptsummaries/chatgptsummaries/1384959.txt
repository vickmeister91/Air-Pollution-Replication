The Andhra High Court recently heard a writ appeal filed by Vasam Kotayya and others against S. Rayavaram Gram Panchayat. The appellants had filed a writ petition seeking a mandamus against the Gram Panchayat for granting permission to the second respondent to construct a rice mill. The learned single Judge had directed the petitioners to avail statutory appeal remedy under Section 128(1) of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994. However, the appellants contended that no appeal lies under Section 128(1) of the Act to the Gram Panchayat against the impugned order of the Executive Officer of the S. Rayavaram Gram Panchayat.

The court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the learned single Judge, restoring the writ petition to the file. The court held that the learned single Judge had erred in directing the petitioners to avail statutory appeal remedy under Section 128(1) of the Act. The court observed that the said provision only provides for an appeal to the Gram Panchayat against the orders of the Panchayat Secretary or the Executive Officer, and not against the orders of the Gram Panchayat itself.

The court further held that the impugned order of the Executive Officer granting permission to the second respondent to construct a rice mill was in violation of the provisions of the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act, 1994 and the rules made thereunder. The court observed that the Executive Officer had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act and the rules for granting such permission. The court also noted that the Executive Officer had not taken into consideration the objections raised by the appellants before granting the permission.

In light of the above, the court allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the learned single Judge. The court directed the Gram Panchayat to consider the objections raised by the appellants and pass a fresh order in accordance with law. The court also directed the Executive Officer to follow the procedure prescribed under the Act and the rules for granting permission for the construction of the rice mill.

This case highlights the importance of following the procedure prescribed under the law while granting permissions for construction activities. It also emphasizes the need for authorities to consider objections raised by the public before granting such permissions. The court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to authorities to act in accordance with the law and to ensure that the rights of the public are protected.
