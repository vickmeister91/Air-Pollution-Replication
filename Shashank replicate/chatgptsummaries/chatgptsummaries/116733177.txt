The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Triveni Nath Mishra against the State of Uttar Pradesh and others. The petitioner's services were regularized under Section 33-B of the U.P. Secondary Education Services Selection Board Act, 1982, but the Regularisation Committee reopened the case and concluded that there were no vacant posts available for regularisation. The court found that the determination of sanctioned posts of Assistant Teachers in L.T. Grade by the Regional Level Committee was not sustainable as relevant materials were not taken into account. 

The court also found that the Regional Level Committee was not justified in revoking the regularisation order of the petitioner. The appointment made in the recognized intermediate institution had attained finality and could only be reopened by the Director alone. The writ petition was allowed, and the order of the Regional Level Committee was quashed.

The case highlights the importance of following due process and taking into account all relevant materials when making decisions regarding the regularization of employees. The court found that the Regional Level Committee had not done so in this case, leading to an unjust revocation of the petitioner's regularisation order.

It is also important to note that the court emphasized the finality of the appointment made in the recognized intermediate institution. This means that once an appointment has been made and finalized, it cannot be reopened or revoked by anyone other than the Director. This serves as a reminder to employers to ensure that all appointments are made in accordance with the law and that due process is followed.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and taking into account all relevant materials when making decisions regarding the regularization of employees. It also highlights the finality of appointments made in recognized institutions and the need to ensure that all appointments are made in accordance with the law.
