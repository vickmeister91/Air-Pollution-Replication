The Madras High Court recently issued an order directing the respondents to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of consent to operate under the WATER Act. The court ordered the respondents to pass appropriate orders by May 31, 2018, in accordance with the law. The petitioner had filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus directing the third respondent to dispose of the application dated April 19, 2017, for the renewal of consent to operate for a period of five years.

The respondents had filed a joint counter affidavit stating that the application would be considered in the Consent Clearance Committee meeting within a week. However, the petitioner argued that the respondents had failed to consider the application for renewal of consent to operate, despite the fact that the petitioner had submitted all the necessary documents and had paid the requisite fees.

The court noted that the petitioner had complied with all the requirements under the law and had submitted all the necessary documents and fees. The court also observed that the respondents had failed to consider the application for renewal of consent to operate, despite the fact that the petitioner had submitted all the necessary documents and had paid the requisite fees.

The court further noted that the respondents had not provided any valid reason for the delay in considering the application for renewal of consent to operate. The court held that the respondents were duty-bound to consider the application for renewal of consent to operate and to pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

The court also observed that the right to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court held that the respondents had a duty to ensure that the petitioner's application for renewal of consent to operate was considered and appropriate orders were passed in accordance with the law.

In light of the above, the court directed the respondents to consider the petitioner's application for renewal of consent to operate and to pass appropriate orders by May 31, 2018, in accordance with the law. The court also directed the respondents to ensure that the petitioner's right to clean and safe drinking water was protected and that the environment was not adversely affected by the activities of the petitioner.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring that the right to clean and safe drinking water is upheld. The court's order also highlights the need for government agencies to act promptly and efficiently in considering applications for renewal of consent to operate and to ensure that appropriate orders are passed in accordance with the law.
