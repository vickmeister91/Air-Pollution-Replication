The Supreme Court of India has recently heard a case regarding noise pollution and its impact on the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The case was filed by an engineer after a 13-year-old girl's cries for help during a rape went unheard due to loud music from nearby loudspeakers. The court examined the definition of noise and its adverse effects on health and well-being. The court also discussed the conflict between the right to freedom of speech and the right to live in an atmosphere free from noise pollution. The court ultimately directed the enforcement of existing laws to restrict the use of loudspeakers and other high-volume noise-producing systems.

The court order discusses the harmful effects of noise pollution on human health, including physical and psychological stress, hearing loss, interference with communication and sleep, annoyance, and decreased performance. The sources of noise pollution include industrial and non-industrial sources such as road traffic, aircraft, railroads, construction, industry, noise in buildings, and consumer products. The use of fireworks is also discussed as a health hazard due to air and noise pollution. The court order emphasizes the need to protect citizens' fundamental rights and take measures to reduce noise pollution.

The court order discusses the issue of noise and air pollution caused by firecrackers during the Diwali festival in India. The excessive noise and smoke violate citizens' fundamental rights, including the right to leisure, sleep, and silence. The court cites studies that show the ambient noise level on Diwali day exceeds the limit at almost all places, and the percentage of violation varies from 2% to 58%. The court also mentions similar noise pollution problems in other countries and the legislation they have enacted to control it. The court suggests that immediate steps need to be taken to address the issue of noise pollution caused by firecrackers during Diwali.

The court order discusses various regulations and laws related to noise pollution control. It mentions the need for negotiations with licensed premises to incorporate Pollution Reduction Programs (PRPs) to reduce noise exposure to residents. The Noise Control (Miscellaneous Articles) Regulation 1995 and the Montgomery County Noise Control Ordinance provide limitations on noise disturbances and establish quiet hours. The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, enacted by the Government of India, specify ambient air quality standards in respect of noise for different areas/zones. The Explosives Act, 1884, regulates the manufacture, possession, use, sale, transport, import & export of explosives, including firecrackers. The court cites various judicial opinions in India that have held individuals liable for causing noise pollution.

The court order aims to prevent noise pollution, which has been found to cause various health problems such as mental illness, hearing loss, and heart trouble. The court recognizes the need for development but emphasizes the importance of balancing it with environmental protection. Indian judicial opinion has been consistent in recognizing the right to live in freedom from noise pollution as a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court has passed several interim orders to enforce noise pollution regulations, including restrictions on the use of fireworks and loudspeakers. The court also emphasizes the need for creating environmental awareness among students through education.

The court order discusses the importance of enforcing fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens to live in a pollution-free environment. The court allows parties affected to make representations to their respective state governments, who may invite the attention of the Government of India if satisfied with the genuineness of the representation. The order also highlights the difficulty in implementing noise pollution control methodology in India and the lack of awareness among citizens about the deleterious effects of noise pollution. The order discusses the issue of firecrackers and questions such as the maximum permissible sound level, method of checking compliance, and responsibility for implementation. The court suggests that the present noise standards prescribed by the government are correct and do not need to be altered at the moment. The order also discusses the Department of Explosives' role in enforcing noise standards and suggests that manufacturers should control the size and composition of firecrackers to comply with the noise limits prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.

The court order discusses the need to regulate the use of firecrackers in India to prevent noise pollution and health hazards. The court suggests fixing the chemical composition and size of firecrackers to conform to noise emission norms, rather than measuring noise levels at the time of bursting. The court also rejects calls for relaxation of restrictions on bursting firecrackers during festivals and suggests collective celebration of festivals with fireworks away from residential areas. The court concludes that the total restriction on bursting firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am must continue without any relaxation.

The court order restricts the use of firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am without any exceptions. The court also states that the restriction does not violate religious rights as Diwali is associated with pooja and not firecrackers. The court suggests that firecrackers emitting colors or lights can be used instead of sound-emitting ones. The court also recommends creating awareness about the hazardous effects of noise pollution and regulating the use of loudspeakers and high sound-producing instruments. The court directs the Department of Explosives to come up with chemical formulae for each type of firecracker and to specify the maximum permissible weight of every chemical used in manufacturing firecrackers. The court also allows the manufacture of firecrackers for export with higher noise levels subject
