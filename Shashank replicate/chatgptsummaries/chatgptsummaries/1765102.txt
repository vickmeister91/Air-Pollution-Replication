The Madras High Court recently passed an order in response to a petition filed by a concerned citizen regarding the welfare of elephants during festivals and processions. The petitioner had sought a direction from the authorities to prevent the parading of elephants between 11 am and 5 pm and to prosecute offenders who violate the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

In response to the petition, the respondents filed a detailed statement and issued circulars to prevent cruelty to elephants. The court took note of these measures and disposed of the petition, stating that sufficient safeguards have been taken by the respondents to ensure the welfare of elephants during festivals and processions.

However, the court did allow an application for impleading additional respondents, indicating that there may be further action taken to ensure the welfare of elephants in the future.

The court's decision to dispose of the petition was based on the fact that the respondents had taken sufficient measures to prevent cruelty to elephants during festivals and processions. The court noted that the respondents had issued circulars to ensure that elephants were not subjected to any kind of cruelty, and that they had taken steps to ensure that the elephants were not paraded during the hottest part of the day.

The court also noted that the petitioner could approach the District Collector for redressal of grievances, indicating that there were other avenues available for addressing concerns related to the welfare of elephants.

The court's decision to allow an application for impleading additional respondents suggests that there may be further action taken to ensure the welfare of elephants in the future. This could include additional measures to prevent cruelty to elephants during festivals and processions, or the imposition of stricter penalties for those who violate the Wild Life (Protection) Act.

Overall, the court's order reflects a commitment to ensuring the welfare of elephants during festivals and processions. While the court has disposed of the petition, it has left open the possibility for further action to be taken in the future to ensure that elephants are not subjected to any kind of cruelty.
