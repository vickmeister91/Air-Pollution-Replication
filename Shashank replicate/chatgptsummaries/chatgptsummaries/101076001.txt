M/S S.R. Foils and Tissues (P) Ltd and its directors have been summoned to face trial for not filing tax returns and not depositing due taxes for assessment years 2008-09 to 2012-13. The company and its directors filed five revision petitions against the order, but they were rejected due to a delay in filing and lack of convincing reasons for the delay. The court heard the case on merits and found the revision petitions to be devoid of any merit. The court provided a tabular form of relevant dates and details for each assessment year in question.

The court order pertains to a case where the accused (petitioners) have allegedly willfully not paid outstanding tax demands for several assessment years, despite notices and orders being issued to them. The prosecution has alleged that the accused have committed an offence punishable under Section 276-C(2) r/w 278-B of the IT Act. The defence counsel argued that the prosecution has failed to bring any material on record as regards the accused's alleged offence. 

The court referred to relevant provisions of the IT Act, including Section 278(B) and 278(E), and noted that in any prosecution for an offence under the Act which requires a culpable mental state on the part of the accused, the court shall presume the existence of such mental state. The burden is shifted to the accused to prove that they had no such mental state. The court found that the accused had not provided any evidence to rebut the presumption of a culpable mental state.

The court order states that the directors of a company are jointly and severally liable for the payment of tax if it cannot be recovered from the company, as per Section 179 of the I.T. Act. The court also notes that the existence of a culpable mental state is presumed in any prosecution under the Act, and it is up to the accused to prove otherwise. The court found no illegality in the impugned order and dismissed the revision petitions.

The case highlights the importance of timely filing of tax returns and payment of due taxes. Failure to do so can result in legal action and severe consequences. The court's decision to presume the existence of a culpable mental state in cases of tax evasion underscores the seriousness of the offence and the need for individuals and companies to comply with tax laws.

The court's decision also emphasizes the joint and several liability of directors for the payment of tax if it cannot be recovered from the company. This serves as a deterrent for directors who may be tempted to evade taxes or neglect their responsibilities towards the company's tax obligations.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case of M/S S.R. Foils and Tissues (P) Ltd and its directors serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with tax laws and the consequences of failing to do so. The court's decision to presume the existence of a culpable mental state in cases of tax evasion and the joint and several liability of directors for the payment of tax further reinforces the need for individuals and companies to fulfill their tax obligations.
