The Kerala High Court recently heard several writ petitions challenging orders passed by the Special Judge under Sec. 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The orders directed the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau (V&ACB) to conduct a preliminary enquiry and register a case if materials indicating commission of offences as alleged in the private complaints are disclosed. The court considered whether it was within the power of the learned Special Judge to direct the V&ACB to conduct an enquiry/investigation and the V&ACB to enquire/investigate into matters relating to a Co-operative Society registered under the Act. The court also considered whether it was within the power of the learned Special Judge to direct a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the V&ACB before registering a case while passing an order under Sec. 156(3) of the Code.

The court ultimately quashed the orders and declared that a parallel enquiry or investigation by the V&ACB is not contemplated under the Act. The court order pertains to the appointment of a Deputy Inspector General of Police as a Vigilance Officer to investigate cases of misappropriation, corruption, and irregularities in co-operative societies referred to him by the Registrar. The Vigilance Officer is under the administrative control of the Registrar, and the inquiry and investigation are to be conducted as prescribed. The court clarifies that the provisions of the District Police Act do not oust the jurisdiction of the court under the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the investigation under Chapter XII of the Code is to culminate in a final report to be submitted before the appropriate court. The report of inquiry/investigation under the Act is not for the purpose of putting the offender on trial, and the bar of jurisdiction referred to in the Act is only of civil and revenue courts.

The court order also discusses the modification of government orders related to the investigation of misappropriation cases involving cooperative societies. The court holds that the vigilance enquiry under Section 68A of the Act and the investigation by the police/V&ACB under Chapter XII of the Code operate in different fields with different objectives. The court also discusses the power of the Special Judge to direct a preliminary enquiry before registering a case under Section 156(3) of the Code and refers to various decisions of the court on the matter.

In another case, the court order discusses the power of a Special Judge to order a preliminary enquiry to be conducted by officers of the V&ACB/Police while exercising power under Sec.156(3) of the Code. The court found that the Special Judge has no power to order a preliminary enquiry or any type of enquiry to be conducted by any officer of the V&ACB while ordering investigation by invoking power under Sec.156(3) of the Code. The court also distinguished the decision in P.Sirajuddin's case as in that case it was not an order under Sec.156(3) of the Code issued by the Magistrate or the Special Judge but an executive order to investigate into a complaint. The court also referred to other relevant cases and observations made by judges in those cases.

The court order also discusses the power of a Special Judge to direct a preliminary enquiry before registering a case against a public servant accused of corruption. The court cites previous decisions that emphasize the importance of conducting a preliminary enquiry before publicly charging a public servant with acts of dishonesty and corruption. The court also notes that the Special Judge has the power to direct a preliminary enquiry to be conducted before registration of the case to prevent baseless or frivolous complaints from being filed against innocent public servants. The court cites a previous Division Bench decision that ordered the Director of Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau to conduct a preliminary enquiry before registration of the case. The court concludes that the Division Bench decision is authority for the proposition that a Special Judge has the power to direct a preliminary enquiry before registration of the case.

The court order also discusses the legality of preliminary inquiries by the Vigilance Department in corruption cases against public servants. The court upholds the decision of the Division Bench in Satheesh v. Enquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, which directed a preliminary inquiry by the Vigilance Department into allegations against the accused. The court also rejects the argument that the Special Judge did not apply his mind while passing orders and that obtaining signed statements during a preliminary inquiry is illegal. The court concludes that the police/V&ACB have the right to conduct an inquiry/investigation into a cognizable offense committed by a public servant and that the Special Judge has the power to direct an inquiry, registration of the case, investigation, and proceed as provided in the Code.

In conclusion, the court order states that the Special Judge has the power to direct an inquiry, registration of a case, investigation, and proceedings in the matter as provided in the Code. The police or V&ACB should hold an inquiry to find prima facie evidence of guilt of a public servant before registering a case and starting a full-fledged investigation. The writ petitions have failed and are dismissed.
