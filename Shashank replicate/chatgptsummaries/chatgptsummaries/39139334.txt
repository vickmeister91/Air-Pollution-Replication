The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Renew Power Ventures Pvt Ltd seeking to quash FIR No.16/2018 registered against them for offences punishable under Sections 9, 39, 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The allegations made against the petitioner were that a black buck had entered their factory premises and died due to getting entangled in the barbed wire fence. 

The court found that the provisions of Section 9 were not applicable to the case as the petitioner was not involved in hunting. Section 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, deals with hunting of wild animals and states that whoever hunts any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine. The court observed that the petitioner had not hunted the black buck and therefore, Section 9 was not applicable to the case.

The allegations did not attract the provisions of Section 39 either. Section 39 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, deals with the possession, buying or selling of any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV or any part or derivative thereof. The court observed that the petitioner had not possessed, bought or sold the black buck or any part or derivative thereof and therefore, Section 39 was not applicable to the case.

The court also found that the impugned FIR was registered based on the complaint lodged by the Forest Officer in violation of Section 55 of the Act. Section 55 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, deals with the power of the police officer to investigate offences under the Act. The court observed that the Forest Officer was not a police officer and therefore, he did not have the power to investigate offences under the Act. The court further observed that the Forest Officer had not followed the procedure laid down under Section 55 and had directly lodged the complaint with the police. Therefore, the court held that the impugned FIR was registered in violation of Section 55 and quashed the proceedings initiated pursuant to the registration of the FIR.

In conclusion, the court allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings initiated pursuant to the registration of the FIR. The court held that the provisions of Section 9 and Section 39 were not applicable to the case and that the impugned FIR was registered in violation of Section 55 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. This court order serves as a reminder that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, must be strictly adhered to and that the power to investigate offences under the Act lies with the police officer and not with any other officer.
