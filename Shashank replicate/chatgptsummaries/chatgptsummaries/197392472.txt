The court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership between Inderjit Kaur and the State of Punjab. Kaur claimed to have purchased the land and constructed a marriage palace on it with the approval of the Senior Town Planner. However, the Forest department claimed that Kaur encroached upon forest land and misled the court about the extent of her ownership. The court examined various documents and found that Kaur had no right or title to the land in question. The Collector ordered Kaur to hand over possession of the land to the Forest Divisional Officer within one month. The appellate authority affirmed this decision.

In a separate case, the court order affirmed that the appellant was in unauthorized possession of government/forest land and failed to produce any evidence to show that she had any right/title to the said land. The court found no ground to differ with the findings of the authorities and directed the petitioner's eviction. The court expressed concern about the misuse of forest land for commercial purposes and ordered the Chief Secretary of Punjab to look into the matter and do the needful. The court dismissed the petition and ruled that the land belonging to the Forest department cannot be used for any other purposes without prior permission of the Central Government.

The first court order dealt with a dispute between Inderjit Kaur and the State of Punjab over land ownership. Kaur claimed to have purchased the land and constructed a marriage palace on it with the approval of the Senior Town Planner. However, the Forest department claimed that Kaur encroached upon forest land and misled the court about the extent of her ownership. The court examined various documents and found that Kaur had no right or title to the land in question. The Collector ordered Kaur to hand over possession of the land to the Forest Divisional Officer within one month. The appellate authority affirmed this decision.

The second court order dealt with an unauthorized possession of government/forest land by an appellant who failed to produce any evidence to show that she had any right/title to the said land. The court found no ground to differ with the findings of the authorities and directed the petitioner's eviction. The court expressed concern about the misuse of forest land for commercial purposes and ordered the Chief Secretary of Punjab to look into the matter and do the needful. The court dismissed the petition and ruled that the land belonging to the Forest department cannot be used for any other purposes without prior permission of the Central Government.

The court's decision in both cases was based on the examination of various documents and evidence presented by the parties involved. In the first case, Kaur claimed to have purchased the land and constructed a marriage palace on it with the approval of the Senior Town Planner. However, the Forest department claimed that Kaur encroached upon forest land and misled the court about the extent of her ownership. The court found that Kaur had no right or title to the land in question and ordered her to hand over possession of the land to the Forest Divisional Officer within one month.

In the second case, the appellant was found to be in unauthorized possession of government/forest land and failed to produce any evidence to show that she had any right/title to the said land. The court found no ground to differ with the findings of the authorities and directed the petitioner's eviction. The court expressed concern about the misuse of forest land for commercial purposes and ordered the Chief Secretary of Punjab to look into the matter and do the needful.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of proper documentation and evidence when it comes to land ownership and use. The court found that Kaur had no right or title to the land in question because she could not provide sufficient evidence to support her claim. Similarly, the appellant in the second case was found to be in unauthorized possession of government/forest land because she could not produce any evidence to show that she had any right/title to the said land.

The court's concern about the misuse of forest land for commercial purposes is also noteworthy. The court ordered the Chief Secretary of Punjab to look into the matter and do the needful, indicating that there may be a larger issue at play when it comes to the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court's ruling that the land belonging to the Forest department cannot be used for any other purposes without prior permission of the Central Government reinforces the need for proper regulation and oversight when it comes to the use of natural resources.

Overall, the court's decision in both cases serves as a reminder of the importance of proper documentation and evidence when it comes to land ownership and use. It also highlights the need for proper regulation and oversight when it comes to the use of natural resources, particularly forest land.
