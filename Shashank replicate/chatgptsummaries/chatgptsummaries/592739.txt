The Kerala High Court recently heard a case brought by Harrisons Malayalam Limited against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The company argued that it should not be subject to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, as it did not carry out any activities that would pollute water sources. The Act only applies to specified industries, which are listed in Schedule I. The company argued that it did not fall under any of these industries. 

The court considered whether the processing of rubber from latex could be considered a vegetable product, as defined in Schedule I. The court emphasized that fiscal statutes must be strictly construed and that words should be understood in their usual and most known signification. The court ultimately did not reach a decision on this point, but the case highlights the importance of clear language in legislation and the need for careful interpretation of fiscal statutes.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the term "vegetable products" in a taxing statute and whether processing of latex can be considered as an industry under item 15 of Schedule I of the Act. The court refers to various precedents and concludes that processing of latex cannot be considered as item 15 of Schedule I of the Act, and therefore, the petitioner is not liable to be taxed for the water used in the process of latex in their rubber plantations. The notices and assessment orders directing levy of cess in regard to petitioner's rubber estates are quashed.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, only applies to specified industries, which are listed in Schedule I. It is important for companies to understand whether they fall under any of these industries and whether they are subject to the Act.
