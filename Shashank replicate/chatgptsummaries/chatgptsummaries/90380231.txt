The Kerala High Court recently issued a writ petition seeking a mandamus to prevent the 5th respondent from conducting quarrying without necessary statutory licenses, permissions, and No Objection Certificates. An interim order was passed directing respondents 1 to 3 to ensure that the 5th respondent shall not conduct any illegal quarrying without proper licenses, permits, or consent. The 5th respondent submitted that they are not conducting any quarrying operation in the property in question and have made an application before the Panchayat, the Mining and Geology Department, and other statutory departments for obtaining licenses, permissions, and consent for running the granite quarry in question. The writ petition was disposed of in terms of the interim order passed by the Court on 21.2.2012.

The writ petition was filed by the petitioner, who is a resident of the area where the quarrying was taking place. The petitioner alleged that the 5th respondent was conducting quarrying operations without obtaining the necessary licenses, permissions, and No Objection Certificates from the concerned authorities. The petitioner further alleged that the quarrying was causing environmental damage and endangering the lives of the people living in the area.

The Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, passed an interim order directing respondents 1 to 3 to ensure that the 5th respondent shall not conduct any illegal quarrying without proper licenses, permits, or consent. The Court also directed the concerned authorities to take appropriate action against the 5th respondent if they were found to be conducting quarrying operations without the necessary licenses, permissions, and No Objection Certificates.

The 5th respondent, in their submission before the Court, denied conducting any quarrying operation in the property in question. They stated that they had made an application before the Panchayat, the Mining and Geology Department, and other statutory departments for obtaining licenses, permissions, and consent for running the granite quarry in question. The 5th respondent also submitted that they were willing to comply with all the necessary legal requirements for conducting quarrying operations.
