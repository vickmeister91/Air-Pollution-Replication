In a recent court order, accused Sadiq Khan and Iqbal Khan were charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act for violating the provisions of section 9, 44 and 49(b)(1) of the Act. The prosecution had recovered birds and body parts of birds specified in Schedule-IV of the Act from the accused's shop. The defense counsel argued that the accused had been falsely implicated and that there were material contradictions in the testimonies of the complainant's witnesses. However, the court held that there was prima facie evidence to frame charges against the accused under sections 44 and 49(b)(1) of the Act. The court also clarified that the charge under section 9 of the Act was not made out as there was no allegation of hunting against the accused.
