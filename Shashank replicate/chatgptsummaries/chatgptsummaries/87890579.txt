The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by M/s Taneja Developers and Infrastructure Ltd. and others seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board under the Environment Protection Act. The petitioners argued that they already had an Environment Clearance Certificate and therefore the complaint was bad in law. The court agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings arising from it. The court referred to a previous order passed in a similar case and disposed of the petition accordingly.

The case at hand involves a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Taneja Developers and Infrastructure Ltd. and others under the Environment Protection Act. The complaint alleged that the petitioners had violated various environmental norms and regulations, and sought appropriate action against them. The petitioners, however, argued that they already had an Environment Clearance Certificate, which authorized them to carry out the activities in question, and therefore the complaint was bad in law.

The court, after hearing both sides, agreed with the petitioners and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings arising from it. The court noted that the petitioners had indeed obtained an Environment Clearance Certificate, which authorized them to carry out the activities in question, and therefore the complaint filed against them was not maintainable. The court also referred to a previous order passed in a similar case, which had held that once an Environment Clearance Certificate is obtained, no further permission or clearance is required under the Environment Protection Act.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it reaffirms the importance of obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate before carrying out any activities that may have an impact on the environment. The Environment Clearance Certificate is a mandatory requirement under the Environment Protection Act, and failure to obtain it can result in legal action being taken against the violator. The court's decision also highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, and the importance of ensuring that violators are held accountable for their actions.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development for environmental protection in India. It reaffirms the importance of obtaining an Environment Clearance Certificate before carrying out any activities that may have an impact on the environment, and highlights the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations. The court's decision also serves as a reminder that violators of environmental laws and regulations will be held accountable for their actions, and that legal action will be taken against them if necessary.
