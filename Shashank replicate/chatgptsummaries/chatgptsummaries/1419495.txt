The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case in which the Karnataka Lorry Malikara Okkuta and some registered owners of lorries filed petitions to quash a government order banning vehicles aged over 15 years from entering Bangalore City. The petitioners argued that the order violated their fundamental rights and that the government had misinterpreted a Supreme Court order. However, the court rejected the petitioners' arguments, stating that the government had the power to issue such orders under the Environment Act and the Air Act.

The court directed the government to devise a scheme to replace old vehicles and give vehicle owners sufficient time to replace them. The court also ordered the authorities to create a scheme for replacing old vehicles with CNG fuel in a phased manner to reduce pollution. The authorities should monitor and check vehicles to ensure they comply with pollution and traffic rules.

The impugned notification has lapsed, and the court expects the state government to take appropriate steps within six months. The court has disposed of the writ petitions.
