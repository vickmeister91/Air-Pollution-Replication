In a recent court order, the bail application filed by Rishi Lal Matare and Sunil Panche was granted. The two were arrested on 24th July 2018 for hunting a spotted deer and selling its meat, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. The defense counsel argued that there was no direct evidence against the accused and they were falsely implicated. The court allowed the bail application and directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each and cooperate in the trial. The accused were also directed to comply with other conditions, including not leaving India without the trial court's permission.

The case against the accused was based on the allegation that they had hunted a spotted deer and sold its meat. The prosecution had argued that the accused had been caught red-handed with the meat and that there was sufficient evidence to prove their guilt. However, the defense counsel had argued that there was no direct evidence against the accused and that they had been falsely implicated.

The court, after hearing both sides, had granted bail to the accused. The court had directed the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each and cooperate in the trial. The accused were also directed to comply with other conditions, including not leaving India without the trial court's permission.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was based on several factors. Firstly, the court had noted that there was no direct evidence against the accused and that the prosecution's case was based on circumstantial evidence. Secondly, the court had noted that the accused had no previous criminal record and were not likely to abscond. Thirdly, the court had noted that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had not interfered with the trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was also based on the fact that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period of time. The court had noted that the accused had been in custody for over a year and that their continued detention was not justified.

The court had also directed the accused to comply with certain conditions while on bail. The accused were directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each and cooperate in the trial. The accused were also directed to comply with other conditions, including not leaving India without the trial court's permission.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Rishi Lal Matare and Sunil Panche was based on several factors, including the lack of direct evidence against the accused, their cooperation with the investigation, and their lack of previous criminal record. The court had also directed the accused to comply with certain conditions while on bail, including not leaving India without the trial court's permission.
