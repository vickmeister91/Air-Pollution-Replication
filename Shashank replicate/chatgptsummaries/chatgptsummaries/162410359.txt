On May 10, 2018, a court order (WP(C)/7423/2018) was issued regarding a challenge to the demand of water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The urgency of the matter was noted, and it was decided that the case would be placed before the appropriate assigned Bench the following week.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities. The purpose of the cess was to generate funds for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act empowered the Central Government to notify the rate of cess, which could be different for different industries or areas.

However, the imposition of the water cess has been a contentious issue, with some industries and local authorities challenging its legality and the method of calculation. The court order in question pertains to one such challenge.

The petitioner in the case has challenged the demand of water cess on the grounds that it is arbitrary and discriminatory. The petitioner has argued that the method of calculation of the cess is not based on any scientific or rational basis, and that it unfairly burdens certain industries and local authorities.

The court order notes the urgency of the matter, indicating that the petitioner may be facing immediate financial hardship due to the demand of water cess. The order also suggests that the issue is complex and requires careful consideration by an appropriate Bench.

It is not clear from the court order which Bench will be assigned to hear the case, or what the timeline for the hearing and decision will be. However, the fact that the matter is being expedited suggests that the court recognizes the importance of resolving the issue quickly.

Overall, the court order highlights the ongoing debate and legal challenges surrounding the imposition of water cess under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The case in question will likely provide further insight into the legality and fairness of the cess, and may have implications for other industries and local authorities facing similar demands.
