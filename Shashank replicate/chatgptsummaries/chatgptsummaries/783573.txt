The court order pertains to a long-standing issue of pollution caused by industrial units in Gujarat, particularly in the Kharicut Canal and the areas in the immediate vicinity. The petitioners, two agriculturists, allege that the industries are discharging polluted effluents into the canal, which leads to Khari river, and that the water pollution caused by the industries has made the water in the Khari river unsuitable for agriculture. The petitioners seek action against the State of Gujarat, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, and the Gujarat Electricity Board for not taking steps to control and curb the water pollution of Khari river, which is resulting in the violation of the petitioners' fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The court provides background on the legal provisions related to pollution control and the permissible limits for different parameters in relation to the discharge of effluent. The court notes that many of these industries have not met the pollution control standards set by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB), and that the government and industry have not made sufficient efforts to address the problem. The court also provides information on the expenses involved in treating effluent to meet GPCB standards, and notes that some industries have not complied with hazardous waste handling regulations.

The court ordered a committee to investigate the extent of pollution and determine who was responsible for causing it. Reports from the committee revealed that many industrial units were not complying with pollution control standards and were causing pollution in the canal. The court ordered these units to meet the standards within a specific timeframe or face closure. The court also directed the government and industrial associations to take necessary measures to control pollution.

As far as textile and processing houses are concerned, the court ordered that 24 units that did not meet the basic parameters of the primary treatment plant within the stipulated period of 30 days should be closed down immediately. The court also ordered that industries consuming more than 50,000 litres of water per day and those manufacturing polluting acids should have established secondary treatment plants before going into production. The court further ordered that no industry, however small, should be permitted to operate without an operative treatment plant. The Bhanujan Committee Report identified the industries responsible for pollution as manufacturers of dyes and intermediates, pharmaceuticals, specified industries manufacturing seven items, and steel rolling mills. Textile and processing houses were also identified as polluting industries. The report recommended that the project should be self-financing for servicing of the system and meeting operation and maintenance costs, and cost recovery on the basis of polluter pays may be arranged.

The court found that the industry had persistently and consistently failed to comply with the law and had made little effort to control pollution. The industry had been aware of the requirements since 1981 but had not taken any action. The court rejected the industry's request for more time to comply and ordered closure of polluting units. The court also criticized the Chokhavatia report, which was not based on factual or scientific data.

The court outlines limitations that must be followed for the successful implementation of a Master Plan. These limitations include restrictions on effluent discharge from industries, confirmation of effluent volume and production capacity, and the provision of a V-notch in outlet pipes. The court is faced with the decision of whether to allow continued pollution or enforce closure of non-compliant units. The court also discusses the use of fines as a deterrent and suggests the use of non-polluting vegetable dyes in the textile industry. The closure of carbonising processes is also recommended unless the necessary treatment plants are established.

The court emphasizes the importance of strengthening the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and creating more posts for young environmental engineers and technicians to monitor and enforce pollution laws. The court also discusses the issue of solid waste disposal and the need for hazardous waste to be disposed of in an environmentally safe manner. The court ultimately concludes that temporary closure of polluting industrial units may be necessary in order to ensure compliance with pollution control laws and protect the fundamental rights of citizens affected by pollution.

The court orders the closure of polluting industrial units until they are able to achieve pollution control norms set by the G.P.C.B. The court also directs the state government to ensure that textile and polluting chemical industrial units achieve the G.P.C.B. norms by a certain deadline, failing which they will be closed down. The court emphasizes the need for statutory protection of the environment and recommends that the public be the watchdogs for protecting the environment.

The court order requires the cessation of production by polluting industrial units until they meet G.P.C.B. norms and obtain necessary consent. The State of Gujarat, G.I.D.C., and A.M.C. are directed to lay separate pipes and drains to carry treated industrial effluent to Pirana for mixing with treated sewage before discharge into the river. The order also includes directions for disconnecting unauthorized connections with municipal drains, implementing solid waste disposal recommendations, and surveying industry operating within Ahmedabad's industrial limits. The State is directed not to allow the establishment or expansion of any new polluting industry without first satisfying G.P.C.B. norms. The order also includes directions for strengthening the pollution enforcement agency, establishing a state-level ecological science and research group, and shifting highly polluting and water-intensive units to suitable alternative sites. The order requires a lumpsum payment by industrial units for the works of socio-economic uplift of
