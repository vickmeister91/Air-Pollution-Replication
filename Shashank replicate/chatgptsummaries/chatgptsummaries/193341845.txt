The court order in question relates to a civil revision petition that was filed by the defendants in a partition suit. The defendants had previously filed an application to re-open the case for the examination of witnesses, but this was rejected by the trial court. They then filed an application under Section 94 E of the Civil Procedure Code to adduce evidence before the lower appellate court, but this was also dismissed.

The defendants subsequently filed a civil revision petition challenging the lower appellate court's decision to dismiss their application. However, the court found no error in the lower appellate court's order and dismissed the civil revision petition.

Despite this, the petitioners were given the liberty to file an application under Order 41 Rule 27 of the Civil Procedure Code before the lower appellate court. This rule allows for the admission of additional evidence during the appellate stage of a case, provided that certain conditions are met.

It is important to note that the court's decision to dismiss the civil revision petition does not necessarily mean that the defendants' case is without merit. Rather, it simply means that the court did not find any legal errors in the lower appellate court's decision to dismiss their application to adduce evidence.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and rules when attempting to adduce evidence in a civil case. While the defendants were unsuccessful in their attempts to do so thus far, they still have the opportunity to file an application under Order 41 Rule 27 and potentially present additional evidence before the lower appellate court.
