The court order in question pertains to a Criminal Revision Application filed by Kantibhai Punjabhai Patel against the State of Gujarat. The application was made to challenge an order passed by the Special Judge and 5th Additional Sessions Judge, Nadiad, rejecting Patel's application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which sought the production of details of mobile calls. The judge had also imposed a cost of Rs. 500 on Patel.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, Patel had sought the production of details of mobile calls as part of the proceedings before the trial court.

The court, in its order, noted that the trial court had already directed the production of the call details sought by Patel. Therefore, the court held that there was no need for Patel to seek the same relief again through an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court further observed that the trial court had already taken note of the importance of the call details and had directed their production. Therefore, the court held that there was no need for any further direction in this regard.

The court also noted that the trial court had imposed a cost of Rs. 500 on Patel for filing the application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court, however, found no justification for imposing such a cost on Patel. Therefore, the court disposed of the application by deleting the part of the order that imposed costs and reserving liberty for Patel to make such a prayer at a later stage of the proceedings before the trial court.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a Criminal Revision Application filed by Kantibhai Punjabhai Patel against the State of Gujarat. The court disposed of the application by deleting the part of the order that imposed costs and reserving liberty for Patel to make such a prayer at a later stage of the proceedings before the trial court. The court held that there was no need for Patel to seek the production of the call details again through an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, as the trial court had already directed their production. The court also found no justification for imposing a cost of Rs. 500 on Patel for filing the application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
