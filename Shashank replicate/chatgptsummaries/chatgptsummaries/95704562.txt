Gayasuddin Khan, the petitioner, had filed a bail plea in a case registered under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The petitioner had argued that the Notifications dated 26.08.1955 issued on 04.10.1961 annexed with the prosecution report dated 12.12.2008 had lost force on lapse of 30 years in view of the provisions of Section 30(b) of the Indian Forest Act. However, the State opposed the bail plea and submitted that the notification had not lost its force and that the petitioner had illegally quarried boulders from the protected forest area.

The case revolved around the interpretation of Section 30(b) of the Indian Forest Act, which deals with the duration of notifications issued under the Act. The petitioner argued that the notifications had lost their force after 30 years, while the State argued that they were still valid. The court had to decide whether the notifications had indeed lost their force or not.

After hearing both sides, the court directed the petitioner to surrender within two weeks and granted bail on furnishing a bond of Rs.10,000/- with two sureties of the like amount each. The court did not accept the petitioner's argument that the notifications had lost their force and held that they were still valid. The court also found that the petitioner had illegally quarried boulders from the protected forest area.

The court's decision was based on a careful interpretation of the Indian Forest Act and the notifications issued under it. The court found that the notifications had not lost their force after 30 years and were still valid. The court also found that the petitioner had violated the Act by illegally quarried boulders from the protected forest area.

The court's decision has important implications for the interpretation of the Indian Forest Act and the notifications issued under it. It clarifies that notifications issued under the Act do not lose their force after 30 years and are still valid. This decision will have a significant impact on future cases involving the Indian Forest Act and the notifications issued under it.
