In the first court order, a landlord filed an eviction petition against a tenant on the grounds of bonafide requirement of a shop. The petitioner claimed that he needed the shop to construct additional rooms on the ground floor of the property, which he and his family occupied. However, the court dismissed the eviction petition, stating that the petitioner failed to prove his bonafide requirement for the shop. The court also noted that the petitioner's claim of needing three separate bedrooms for his visiting daughters was a mere desire and not a bonafide requirement.

Similarly, in the second court order, the petitioner failed to prove that the first floor of the property is in exclusive possession of his son and that he does not have sufficient accommodation available on the ground floor. The court also found that the petitioner's need for a dining room, pooja room, and three separate bedrooms for his married daughters was not bonafide. The court cited various cases to support the landlord's right to ask for ground floor accommodation for convenience and comfort of health. The eviction petition was dismissed due to the petitioner's failure to prove bonafide requirement and non-availability of alternate accommodation.

However, in the third court order, the petitioner, a Chartered Accountant, was allowed to evict the respondent from a tenanted shop on the ground floor of a property in Delhi. The petitioner needed the space for additional rooms for his three married daughters and their families, who often stay with him during school holidays. The respondent was given one month to vacate the shop and cannot sublet or create any third-party interest in the space during that time. The court found that the petitioner's need for additional space was valid and the trial court's findings were incorrect.

The court orders highlight the importance of proving bonafide requirement and non-availability of alternate accommodation in eviction cases. In the first two court orders, the petitioners failed to prove their bonafide requirement for the shop and additional rooms, respectively. The court noted that the petitioners' claims were mere desires and not bonafide requirements. In contrast, in the third court order, the petitioner was able to prove his bonafide requirement for additional rooms for his visiting daughters and their families during school holidays.

The court also emphasized the landlord's right to ask for ground floor accommodation for convenience and comfort of health. In the second court order, the court cited various cases to support this right. However, the petitioner failed to prove that the first floor of the property is in exclusive possession of his son and that he does not have sufficient accommodation available on the ground floor.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of providing sufficient evidence to prove bonafide requirement and non-availability of alternate accommodation in eviction cases. The court also recognizes the landlord's right to ask for ground floor accommodation for convenience and comfort of health.
