The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Electrosteel Steels Limited against the Union of India through various government officials. The petitioner alleged gross violation of principles of natural justice and fair play while passing an order to revoke the environmental clearance granted to the petitioner. The Union of India argued that the petitioner had an alternative remedy of appeal under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read with the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. However, the petitioner argued that the writ petition was maintainable as there had been a violation of natural justice and fair play.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment on the matter. The issue at hand was whether the writ petition was maintainable or not. The petitioner argued that there had been a violation of natural justice and fair play, which made the writ petition maintainable. On the other hand, the Union of India argued that the petitioner had an alternative remedy of appeal under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read with the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The court considered both arguments and reserved judgment on the matter. The court's decision would have significant implications for the petitioner and the Union of India. If the court found that the writ petition was maintainable, it would mean that the petitioner could challenge the order to revoke the environmental clearance granted to them. On the other hand, if the court found that the writ petition was not maintainable, the petitioner would have to pursue an alternative remedy of appeal under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read with the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner against an order passed by the Secretary of the Department. The petitioner alleged that the Joint Secretary who heard the matter was not competent to pass the final order, and that certain materials were taken into account after the date of hearing. The court found that the Joint Secretary had given personal hearing to the petitioner, but was transferred immediately thereafter and left his office on 12.09.2018.

The court was of the view that the person who has to pass the order is required to give personal hearing, otherwise the very purpose of giving personal hearing will be defeated. The court was inclined to entertain this writ petition on the limited ground of violation of principles of natural justice. The court stayed the operation, implementation and execution of the impugned order dated 20.09.2018 and granted two weeks' time to the respondents to file a counter-affidavit.

The court further found that the impugned order had serious repercussions on the unit of the petitioner which is a running unit and has caused prejudice to the petitioner on account of violations of principles of natural justice. The court's decision would have significant implications for the petitioner, as the impugned order had serious repercussions on their unit. The court's decision to stay the operation, implementation and execution of the impugned order would provide some relief to the petitioner.

In conclusion, both court orders pertain to writ petitions filed by petitioners against orders passed by government officials. The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Electrosteel Steels Limited against the Union of India through various government officials, alleging gross violation of principles of natural justice and fair play while passing an order to revoke the environmental clearance granted to the petitioner. The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner against an order passed by the Secretary of the Department. The petitioner alleged that the Joint Secretary who heard the matter was not competent to pass the final order, and that certain materials were taken into account after the date of hearing. 

Both court orders highlight the importance of principles of natural justice and fair play in administrative decision-making. The court's decisions in both cases would have significant implications for the petitioners and the Union of India. The court's decision in the first case would determine whether the writ petition was maintainable or not, while the court's decision in the second case would provide relief to the petitioner by staying the operation, implementation and execution of the impugned order.
