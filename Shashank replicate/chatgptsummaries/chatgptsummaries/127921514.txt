The court order pertains to a petition filed by Sri Chandra Prakash under section 438 Cr.P.C. seeking anticipatory bail in Crime No. 309/2009 registered at Kundapura Police Station, Udupi District. The petitioner was accused of illegally carrying Leopard and Tiger skin and two Tiger nails, which is an offence under sections 9, 39(1)[A], (B), (D), 40, 44, 51 of IPC and the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, denied anticipatory bail to the petitioner and directed him to surrender and apply for regular bail within four days. The court observed that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and the offence committed by him was non-bailable. The court also noted that the petitioner had not cooperated with the investigation and had absconded after the registration of the case.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for anticipatory bail as he had failed to show that he was not guilty of the offence alleged against him. The court also noted that the petitioner had not shown any exceptional circumstances that would warrant the grant of anticipatory bail.

The court, therefore, directed the petitioner to surrender before the investigating officer within four days and apply for regular bail. The court also directed the investigating officer to complete the investigation within a period of three months from the date of surrender of the petitioner.

In conclusion, the court order denies anticipatory bail to the petitioner and directs him to surrender and apply for regular bail within four days. The court also directs the investigating officer to complete the investigation within three months from the date of surrender of the petitioner.
