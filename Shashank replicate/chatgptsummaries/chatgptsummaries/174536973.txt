The court order pertains to three petitions challenging the dismissal of an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Bhopal, and the dismissal of revisions filed by the applicants. The applicants had demanded documents from two banks to prove that payments had been made to the Blue Bells Education Society, and therefore, the cheques issued by them were nothing but a security measure. However, the court found the documents to be doubtful and possibly fabricated, and therefore, the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was dismissed.

The court order pertains to three petitions filed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The court dismissed the applications filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. on merits and directed the applicants to bear the cost of the respondents in each petition. The court also stated that the documents which are not relevant to the case cannot be called and cited a judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of "Om Parkash Sharma Vs. CBI, Delhi" [(2000) 4 SCC 679]. The court ordered a copy of the order to be sent to both the Courts below in each and every case for information and compliance.

The above two court orders pertain to the same case and involve the dismissal of applications filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The applicants had demanded documents from two banks to prove that payments had been made to the Blue Bells Education Society, and therefore, the cheques issued by them were nothing but a security measure. However, the court found the documents to be doubtful and possibly fabricated, and therefore, the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was dismissed.

In the first court order, the dismissal of the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. was challenged through three petitions.

In both court orders, the applicants had demanded documents from two banks to prove that payments had been made to the Blue Bells Education Society, and therefore, the cheques issued by them were nothing but a security measure. However, the court found the documents to be doubtful and possibly fabricated, and therefore, dismissed the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. In the second court order, the court also cited a judgment of Hon'ble the Apex Court in the case of "Om Parkash Sharma Vs. CBI, Delhi" [(2000) 4 SCC 679], which stated that documents which are not relevant to the case cannot be called.
