The court order in question pertains to a criminal case involving M/S Ashoka Service Station and three individuals. The accused had requested the issuance of summons for the production of documents from a bank, which was declined by the Magistrate. The accused challenged this decision in the High Court of Kerala under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The High Court of Kerala dismissed the petition, stating that any challenges to the Magistrate's decision can be raised in an appeal if an adverse decision is rendered against the accused. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the High Court under Section 482.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. However, the court noted that the inherent powers of the High Court cannot be invoked to bypass the statutory remedies available to the accused.

The court also observed that the issuance of summons for the production of documents from a bank is governed by Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Under this section, a court can issue summons for the production of documents only if it is satisfied that the documents are necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In the present case, the Magistrate had declined to issue summons for the production of documents from the bank as he was not satisfied that the documents were necessary for the purpose of the trial. The accused had not challenged this decision by way of an appeal, and therefore, the High Court could not entertain their petition under Section 482.

The court also noted that the accused had not made out a case for the exercise of the High Court's inherent powers under Section 482. The accused had not shown that the Magistrate's decision was perverse or that it had resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, the court held that the petition was not maintainable under Section 482.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before approaching the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The inherent powers of the High Court cannot be invoked to bypass the statutory remedies available to the accused.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which governs the issuance of summons for the production of documents from a bank. A court can issue summons for the production of documents only if it is satisfied that the documents are necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to litigants to exhaust all available remedies before approaching the High Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The decision also highlights the importance of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which governs the issuance of summons for the production of documents from a bank.
