The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jayantibhai Chaturbhai Bohakiya under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for regular bail in connection with FIR registered at Prohibition C.R. No. 5072 of 2017 with Halvad Police Station, Morbi for the offence punishable under Sections 65(A) (E), 116(B), 81 and 98(1) of the Prohibition Act. The court has allowed the application and ordered the applicant to be released on regular bail subject to certain conditions.

The court has considered the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sanjay Chandra v. Central Bureau of Investigation reported in [2012] 1 SCC 40. In this case, the Supreme Court had held that while granting bail, the court has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support thereof, the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail, the character, behavior, means and standing of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with, the larger interests of the public or the State and similar other considerations.

The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that the investigation in the case has been completed. The court has further noted that the applicant has no criminal antecedents and that he is not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence.

In light of these factors, the court has granted regular bail to the applicant subject to certain conditions. The conditions include that the applicant shall furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court, that he shall not leave the country without the permission of the trial court, that he shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer, and that he shall attend the trial court on all the dates fixed for hearing of the case.

It is important to note that the court has granted bail to the applicant after considering all the relevant factors and after being satisfied that the applicant is not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence. The court has also imposed certain conditions to ensure that the applicant attends the trial court on all the dates fixed for hearing of the case and that he does not interfere with the investigation or the witnesses.

Overall, the court order in question is a well-reasoned and balanced decision that takes into account all the relevant factors and ensures that justice is done in the case. The court has followed the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and has granted bail to the applicant after being satisfied that he is not likely to abscond or tamper with the evidence.
