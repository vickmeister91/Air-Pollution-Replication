The court order in question pertains to the relocation of the chemical trade from the walled city in Delhi to a new location due to safety concerns. The walled city, which is historically significant, has become congested and dangerous due to the large-scale commercial use of the area, including the trade of hazardous and noxious substances. Several serious incidents of fire have taken place in the area, resulting in loss of life and property damage. In light of these concerns, the court has ordered the development of a new location for the chemical trade to be shifted to, with the aim of decongesting the walled city and preventing future tragedies.

Initially, the traders requested to be relocated to Gazipur, but the court rejected this proposal and instead ordered the development of Holambi Kalan to be completed within a specific timeframe. The traders and transporters have been reluctant to shift their places of business, resulting in the devastating fire of 1999. However, the court has rejected the traders' argument that they should be allowed to remain in the walled city and that they are not dealing with inflammable and noxious chemicals. The convenience of the traders cannot be given pre-eminence over the demands of public interest.

To ensure compliance with the court's order, the chemical traders have been directed to deposit a sum of Rs.20,000/- in the registry of the court within two weeks. Unless they furnish proof of the deposit of costs, no allotment of space shall be made in their favor. This measure is intended to ensure that the traders take the court's order seriously and do not attempt to circumvent it.

The court's decision to relocate the chemical trade from the walled city to Holambi Kalan is a significant one, as it addresses the safety concerns that have arisen due to the large-scale commercial use of the area. The traders' reluctance to shift their places of business is understandable, but it cannot be allowed to take precedence over public safety. The court's order is a necessary step towards ensuring that the walled city remains a safe and livable place for its residents.
