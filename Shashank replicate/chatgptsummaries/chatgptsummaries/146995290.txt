The court order in question relates to a case where a petitioner had approached the National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA) seeking to overturn the No Objection Certificate (NOC) granted to a company to establish a brick kiln. The NEAA allowed the appeal and set aside the permission, but the petitioner subsequently filed a petition alleging non-implementation of the NEAA's orders.

However, the court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the NEAA Act had been repealed and the orders passed by the NEAA had been set aside by the High Court. This ruling effectively means that the petitioner's claims of non-implementation of the NEAA's orders are no longer valid.

The NEAA was established under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986, with the aim of providing a forum for hearing appeals against decisions made by the central and state pollution control boards. However, the NEAA Act was repealed in 2010 and its functions were transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

The NGT was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, with the aim of providing a specialized forum for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The NGT has jurisdiction over all civil cases involving substantial environmental issues and has the power to hear appeals against orders passed by the central and state pollution control boards.

In light of the repeal of the NEAA Act and the transfer of its functions to the NGT, the court's dismissal of the petitioner's claims is not surprising. However, it does highlight the importance of keeping abreast of changes in environmental legislation and ensuring that legal proceedings are initiated in the appropriate forum.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance in environmental matters and the importance of seeking legal redress in a timely and appropriate manner. While the NEAA may no longer be in operation, the NGT provides a robust and effective forum for addressing environmental issues and ensuring that the rights of all stakeholders are protected.
