The court order pertains to a challenge made by D. Saravanan against the Environmental Clearance Certificate granted to the Lakshmi Ammal Education Trust for the construction of a Medical College-cum-Hospital adjacent to Ousteri lake. The petitioner argued that the construction would harm the lake, which is an inter-state lake and an important source of ground water recharge, irrigation, and drinking water supply. The petitioner also claimed that the Pondicherry Pollution Control Committee did not follow the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification while conducting the public hearing and granting NOC.

The respondents argued that the petitioner should have approached the National Environment Appellate Authority instead of filing a writ petition. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its judgment. The court order discusses the validity of an Environmental Clearance Certificate issued for the construction of a Medical College-cum-Hospital in Pondicherry. The court emphasizes the need for balancing economic, ecological, social, and cultural interests while issuing such notifications. The court also highlights the doctrine of sustainable development and the higher degree of judicial scrutiny required for actions of the government that attempt to restrict the free use of public resources.

The court finds that the proposal for construction has been appraised as per the prescribed procedure and has been accorded environmental clearance subject to strict compliance with the terms and conditions. The court also notes that an appeal remedy is available before the National Environment Appellate Authority against the orders issued by the Ministry of Environment & Forests. The court order states that the petitioner's contention that there was no appeal remedy against the Ministry of Environment & Forests' orders regarding Environmental Clearance is incorrect, as Section 11 of the National Environment Appellate Authority Act, 1997 provides for an appeal remedy before the National Environment Appellate Authority.

The court also notes that a Notice of Hearing was given in a newspaper, calling for public opinion and objections, and that the project agency submitted an Environment Impact Assessment and Management Plan. The court dismisses the writ petition and connected motions, but allows the petitioner to approach the National Environment Appellate Authority to exhaust their appellate remedy.
