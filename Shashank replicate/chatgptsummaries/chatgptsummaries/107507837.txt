The court order pertains to the case of Halkey Bhai, who has been arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleges that he was found cooking the meat of a wild boar and that the meat, bones, and skin were seized from his possession. The applicant has filed for bail, claiming that he has been falsely implicated in the crime and that there is no likelihood of him absconding or tampering with prosecution witnesses.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court has allowed the application and directed that the applicant be released on bail. However, the court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant. The applicant must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and one solvent surety of the same amount. Additionally, the applicant must abide by the conditions enumerated under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on the principle that bail is a rule and jail is an exception. The court has taken into consideration the fact that the applicant has no criminal antecedents and that he has cooperated with the investigation. The court has also noted that the prosecution has not been able to produce any evidence to show that the applicant is likely to abscond or tamper with prosecution witnesses.

The court has also taken into consideration the fact that the applicant has been in custody for a considerable period of time and that his release on bail will not prejudice the investigation or the trial.

The court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that he does not misuse his liberty.
