The Gauhati High Court recently issued a court order dismissing a writ petition filed by Mahabir Coke Industry and Anr. The court directed the appellant firm to close the operation of all three units immediately until they received consent from the Pollution Control Board and to pay salaries and wages to employees and workmen. The case involved the establishment of a coke manufacturing factory with three units by the appellant firm. The firm had requested consent from the Pollution Control Board, which was given until the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 came into force. However, the appellant firm failed to obtain consent, and the Board issued a notice to explain why consent was not obtained. The Board refused to grant consent for the operation of the unit due to black smoke emissions and lack of preventive measures. The appellant firm was directed to close down its unit until implementation of anti-pollution measures.

The court order discussed whether the Board had the authority and jurisdiction to give direction in exercise of the power under Section 31A and whether the procedure prescribed under the Act had been followed. The court emphasized the need for industrialization and control of pollution and the importance of taking proper measures to reduce pollution to the extent that it does not cause health hazards.

In another case, the court order discussed a violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 by an industrial unit in Assam. The Board had the authority to take necessary steps, including closing down the unit, if consent was not obtained. However, the Board failed to prescribe a standard for emission of air pollutants, did not examine the matter properly, and refused to grant consent without valid grounds. The court held that the Board's actions were illegal, without jurisdiction, and contrary to the provisions of the law. The court also found that the Board's observation that the industrial unit was emitting air pollutants beyond the permissible limit was without any basis.

The court order stated that the Board has the power to issue directions to any person, officer, or authority, but it must be subject to the provisions of the Act and any direction given by the Central Government. The court found that the directions given in the impugned order were illegal and without jurisdiction as they did not consider the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The court also disagreed with the conclusion of the learned single Judge regarding air pollution and set aside the impugned judgment. The court ordered the Board to dispose of the consent application afresh within three months after complying with all the requirements of the Act and the Rules. The appellant-firm is entitled to run the factory until the disposal of the consent application.

In summary, the court orders discussed the violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 by an industrial unit in Assam and the need for the Pollution Control Board to follow the provisions of the Act and the Rules. The court emphasized the importance of taking proper measures to reduce pollution to the extent that it does not cause health hazards. The court ordered the Board to dispose of the consent application afresh within three months after complying with all the requirements of the Act and the Rules. The appellant-firm is entitled to run the factory until the disposal of the consent application.
