The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board recently ordered the closure of an industrial unit located in a residential area due to excessive noise levels. The owners of the unit challenged the order, arguing that the Board did not have the authority to take action against them as there were no prescribed standards for noise pollution in the area. However, the court found that the unit was emitting air pollutants in the form of noise and was therefore subject to action under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court also found that the Board had the power to issue directions for closure of the unit without taking recourse to Section 22-A of the Act.

The court order states that the Board has the power to issue written directions to any person, officer or authority regarding matters within its jurisdiction. The Board can also order the closure of a unit that violates the Act without using Section 22-A. The petitioners cannot establish or operate an industrial plant in an air pollution control area without the Board's prior consent, which they did not obtain. The establishment of the unit is unauthorized and in violation of the Act. The writ petition is dismissed without any orders as to costs.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and the powers of the Pollution Control Board to take action against violators. The court's decision reinforces the fact that the Board has the authority to issue directions and take action against any person or entity that violates the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Act aims to prevent and control air pollution and protect the environment and public health.

The court's decision also emphasizes the need for industrial units to obtain the necessary permissions and consents from the Pollution Control Board before establishing or operating in an air pollution control area. The failure to obtain such permissions can result in the closure of the unit and legal action against the owners.

The case also highlights the issue of noise pollution, which is often overlooked in discussions on environmental pollution. Noise pollution can have serious health impacts, including hearing loss, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular disease. The court's decision to consider noise as a form of air pollution and subject to the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a positive step towards addressing this issue.

In conclusion, the court's decision to uphold the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board's order to close an industrial unit due to excessive noise levels reinforces the importance of adhering to environmental regulations and the powers of the Pollution Control Board to take action against violators. The case also highlights the need for industrial units to obtain the necessary permissions and consents from the Board before establishing or operating in an air pollution control area. The decision to consider noise as a form of air pollution and subject to the provisions of the Act is a positive step towards addressing the issue of noise pollution.
