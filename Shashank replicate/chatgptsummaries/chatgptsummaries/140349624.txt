The Supreme Court of India received a public interest litigation initiated by the petitioners under Article 32 of the Constitution, requesting a ban on the use of fireworks, sparklers, and minor explosives in any form, during festivals or otherwise. The court considered the prayer for a complete prohibition on the sale of fireworks due to pollution in the air caused by the bursting of fireworks. The manufacturers and suppliers of fireworks primarily based in Sivakasi (Tamil Nadu) moved an application for modification of that interim order. The conclusion was that the air in the National Capital Region (NCR) and particularly in Delhi was polluted, resulting in many falling sick and others having to purchase face masks for personal use and install air purifiers in buildings. The court also discussed the statutory standards or the National Ambient Air Quality Standards laid down in India.

The court order discusses the high levels of air pollution in Delhi in November 2016, with AQI levels exceeding 500 and even reaching 700 after Diwali. The order then outlines the National Ambient Air Quality Standards laid down in Schedule VII of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, which specify the acceptable concentrations of various pollutants in ambient air. The pollutants listed include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, ozone, and lead, with different concentration limits for different time periods and types of areas. The methods of measurement for each pollutant are also specified.

The court order lists the acceptable levels of various pollutants in the air, including carbon, ammonia, benzene, arsenic, and nickel. The levels are measured using various methods such as ED-XRF, NDIR spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. The order also specifies the frequency and duration of monitoring required to ensure compliance with the limits. Additionally, the court directed the Union of India to suspend all licenses for the sale of fireworks in the National Capital Region until further notice due to high levels of pollution.

The court ordered the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to study and prepare a report on the harmful effects of materials used in the manufacture of fireworks, but the CPCB has not yet submitted the report. A group of fireworks manufacturers and suppliers filed an application for modification/vacation of the interim order passed on 11th November 2016, arguing that fireworks are not a major contributor to air pollution. They cited a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, which suggests that the bursting of fireworks is not a major cause of air pollution. The applicants also argued that other factors, such as poor wind speed, burning of crops, and stubbles in Punjab and Pakistan, contribute to air pollution in Delhi. They suggested that the ban and sale of fireworks in Delhi and the NCR should be modified or lifted.

The court order discusses the harmful effects of chemicals used in fireworks and a previous order banning the use of certain chemicals in their manufacture. The court also notes that steps have been taken to reduce air pollution during Diwali and mentions the Fireworks Development Research Centre, which has done research on the sound and light emitted by certain fireworks but not on their pollution. The court also references a previous order calling for the evaluation of fireworks based on their chemical composition and a ban on sound-emitting fireworks between 10pm and 6am.

The court order discusses various directions and affidavits related to preventing air pollution during Diwali and making people aware of the health hazards of bursting fireworks. It also mentions the conditions for manufacturing firecrackers for export and the liability of manufacturers if the contents of the box do not match the chemical formulae stated on the box. The order also includes information on the maximum quantity of fireworks permissible and the mandatory conditions laid down in the Explosives Rules.

The court order discusses the issue of cracker shops being adjacent to each other and the possibility of highly inflammable and combustible materials being sold in nearby shops. The court decides not to issue any direction but advises the parties to complete the necessary forms for temporary licenses without delay. The court also discusses the prohibition on bursting fireworks in certain areas and the elevated levels of certain metals and constituents during Diwali day. The court considers the Explosives Act and Rules and the classification of explosives, including fireworks.

The court order discusses the classification of explosives, specifically fireworks, under the Explosives Rules of 2008. Fireworks are categorized into four divisions, with Division 2 comprising manufactured fireworks and Division 3 comprising explosive contrivances for the manufacture of fireworks. The Rules also define terms such as "display fireworks," "fireworks," and "manufactured fireworks." Rule 4 deals with the classification of explosives, including fireworks, into categories such as sound emitting, color or light emitting, and display fireworks. The court is concerned with these categories and their definitions.

The court order outlines rules and regulations for the classification, possession, and marking of fireworks and explosives. UN classification is the only applicable classification, and if an explosive falls within multiple classes, it belongs to the last one. Fireworks are classified into three categories based on their effects. Possession of fireworks for personal use does not require a license. Packages of fireworks must be marked with various details, including the manufacturer's name and the UN classification. Fireworks must also be marked with cautionary warnings and instructions.

The court order discusses various rules and regulations related to the possession, sale, and use of fireworks in India. It also highlights the need to correlate air pollution with the
