The court has issued several orders related to missing person cases. In one case, Sameer Saggar filed a petition regarding his father's disappearance in 2009. Sameer suspects that his father was abducted by his business associates and has provided names and reasons for his suspicion to the investigating agency. The petition includes details of the father's business dealings with various individuals and companies, including M/s City Linkers Infrastructures and M/s Omega Buildcom Ltd. The court has reviewed the petition and ordered the investigating agency to take appropriate action based on the information provided.

In another case, the father of the petitioner had his shareholding in a company transferred to the wives of two accused persons without his knowledge or consent. The father was later reported missing, and the police conducted investigations and polygraph tests on the accused persons, but no useful information was obtained. The court ordered the state to provide a detailed report on the investigation efforts and adjourned the case.

The court also issued an order related to the investigation into the disappearance of Deepak Rai Sagar. Lie detector tests were conducted on several individuals, but some answers were inconclusive. An application was made to conduct a Narco Analysis test on several individuals, but it was dismissed by the court. Various individuals were questioned and their statements recorded, but no useful information was obtained. The investigation also involved collecting call detail reports and income tax notices. However, no information was received about the missing person.

In another case, the court acknowledged the efforts made by Inspector Karambir Singh and other authorities to find a missing person named Deepak Rai Sagar. Despite extensive investigations and announcements of rewards for information, no leads were found. The court acknowledges the efforts made by the authorities but also expresses concern for the citizen's confidence in the legal process. The court also references a previous Supreme Court case regarding the jurisdiction of the CBI in investigating crimes within a state.

The court also issued an order related to the power to direct the CBI to conduct an investigation. The court states that an offense committed within the territory of a state without its consent is valid in law and does not violate the constitution. The court has the obligation to protect the fundamental rights of citizens. However, the court must exercise caution and self-imposed limitations while passing any order. The power to direct the CBI to conduct an investigation should be exercised sparingly and in exceptional situations. In this case, the matter is referred to the CBI as the father of the petitioner has gone missing, and the state's efforts have failed to elicit any material for a satisfactory investigation. The CBI is directed to conclude the investigation as soon as possible and submit the report to the court.

In summary, the court has issued several orders related to missing person cases. The court has ordered the investigating agency to take appropriate action based on the information provided in one case. In another case, the court ordered the state to provide a detailed report on the investigation efforts. In yet another case, the court acknowledged the efforts made by the authorities but also expressed concern for the citizen's confidence in the legal process. The court also issued an order related to the power to direct the CBI to conduct an investigation, stating that it should be exercised sparingly and in exceptional situations. The CBI is directed to conclude the investigation as soon as possible and submit the report to the court.
