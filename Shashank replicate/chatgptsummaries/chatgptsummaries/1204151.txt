Sharif Khan was charged under section 9/51 of Wild Life Protection Act and section 4/25 of Arms Act. These are serious offenses that carry a maximum punishment of three years of rigorous imprisonment. The case is triable by a First Class Magistrate, which means that the trial will be conducted by a lower court.

Despite the seriousness of the charges, the court has granted bail to Sharif Khan. This means that he will be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. However, there are conditions attached to his bail. The court has directed Sharif Khan to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 40,000 and one local surety in the same amount. This means that he will have to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he will appear in court on all subsequent dates of hearing. The surety will also have to provide a similar guarantee.

The court has imposed these conditions to ensure that Sharif Khan does not abscond or fail to appear in court. If he does, the bond and surety will be forfeited, and he will be liable to be arrested again. The court has also directed Sharif Khan to appear in court on all subsequent dates of hearing. Failure to do so will result in the cancellation of his bail.

The decision to grant bail to Sharif Khan is significant because it shows that the court has considered his case and found that he is not a flight risk or a danger to society. It also means that he will be able to prepare his defense while the trial is ongoing. However, it is important to note that bail is not a guarantee of innocence. Sharif Khan will still have to face trial, and if he is found guilty, he will be punished according to the law.
