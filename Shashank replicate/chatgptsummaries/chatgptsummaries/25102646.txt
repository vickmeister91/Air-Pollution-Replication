The court order pertains to two separate cases related to the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas. In the first case, a writ petition was filed by Prabodh Mohanty challenging a notice/letter demanding payment of NPV for the purpose of renewal of mining lease. The petitioner had applied for renewal of mining lease for a reduced area of 188.523 hectares surrendering the balance area of 144.540 hectares. The Divisional Forest Officer had demanded NPV for 177.517 hectares, which the petitioner had deposited. However, the successor-DFO claimed that the total area under Renewal of Mining Lease (RML) is 333.063 hectares and based on such computation, a further demand of Rs.10,33,07,410/- has come to be raised. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved the judgment.

In the second case, a mining company was asked to pay additional NPV for forest land surrendered by them. The court found that the company had already paid the required NPV for the area for which they had sought renewal of the mining lease and had obtained necessary environmental and forest clearances. The court also found that the demand for additional NPV was not justified and set aside the order asking for it. The court directed the state to refund the deposit made by the company and allowed the writ petition in favor of the company.

The court order was issued by B.N. Mahapatra in Cuttack on September 17th, 2014. However, no information was provided regarding the content of the order.

The payment of NPV for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas has been a contentious issue in India. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes should be compensated by the payment of NPV. The NPV is calculated based on the net present value of the forest land, which takes into account the economic value of the forest and the ecological services it provides.

In the first case, the petitioner had already deposited the NPV for the area for which they had sought renewal of the mining lease. However, the successor-DFO claimed that the total area under Renewal of Mining Lease (RML) is 333.063 hectares and based on such computation, a further demand of Rs.10,33,07,410/- has come to be raised. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved the judgment. It is unclear what the final decision of the court was in this case.

In the second case, the mining company had already paid the required NPV for the area for which they had sought renewal of the mining lease and had obtained necessary environmental and forest clearances. However, they were asked to pay additional NPV for forest land surrendered by them. The court found that the demand for additional NPV was not justified and set aside the order asking for it. The court directed the state to refund the deposit made by the company and allowed the writ petition in favor of the company.

The payment of NPV for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas is an important issue as it ensures that the ecological services provided by the forest are compensated for. However, there have been instances where the calculation of NPV has been disputed, leading to legal battles. It is important for the government to ensure that the calculation of NPV is transparent and based on sound scientific principles to avoid such disputes.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate cases related to the payment of NPV for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas. In the first case, the court reserved the judgment after hearing arguments from both sides. In the second case, the court set aside the order asking for additional NPV and directed the state to refund the deposit made by the mining company. The payment of NPV for the renewal of mining leases in forest areas is an important issue and it is important for the government to ensure that the calculation of NPV is transparent and based on sound scientific principles.
