In a recent court order, the case of Devendra Pal Singh Bindra versus the State of Madhya Pradesh was revisited. The applicant's counsel cited a previous judgment by the Apex Court and requested the withdrawal of the criminal revision with liberty to file a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court granted the request and dismissed the criminal revision as withdrawn with liberty.

The case in question involved a criminal revision, which is a legal process that allows a higher court to review a decision made by a lower court. In this case, Devendra Pal Singh Bindra was the applicant, and the State of Madhya Pradesh was the respondent. The details of the case are not provided in the court order, but it is clear that the applicant's counsel believed that a previous judgment by the Apex Court was relevant to the case.

The Apex Court is the highest court in India, and its judgments are binding on all lower courts. The applicant's counsel cited a previous judgment by the Apex Court, which likely provided guidance on how similar cases should be handled. Based on this judgment, the counsel requested that the criminal revision be withdrawn with liberty to file a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows a high court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the legal process or to secure the ends of justice. This section is often used to quash criminal proceedings that are deemed to be frivolous or vexatious. By granting the request to withdraw the criminal revision with liberty to file a petition under Section 482, the court was essentially allowing the applicant to pursue a different legal avenue to achieve the same outcome.

The court order does not provide any information on why the applicant's counsel believed that filing a petition under Section 482 would be more appropriate than pursuing the criminal revision. However, it is possible that the counsel believed that the criminal revision was unlikely to succeed, or that pursuing a petition under Section 482 would be a faster or more efficient way to achieve the desired outcome.

Overall, the court order in the case of Devendra Pal Singh Bindra versus the State of Madhya Pradesh is relatively brief and does not provide much detail on the underlying case. However, it does provide insight into the legal process in India and how different legal avenues can be pursued to achieve the same outcome. It also highlights the importance of previous judgments by the Apex Court and how they can be used to guide legal arguments in similar cases.
