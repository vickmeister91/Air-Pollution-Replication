The Karnataka High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by M/S Akash R Hanji-Sand Stone Crusher Products against the Environment Officer and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner sought to quash an order passed by the Board withdrawing the consent for operation granted to them. The court heard the case and disposed of the petitions, reserving the liberty to the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal since the Chairman to the Karnataka State Appellate Authority had not been appointed.

The petitioner had sought to quash this order, arguing that it was arbitrary and without any basis. The court heard the arguments put forth by both parties and disposed of the petitions.

The court noted that the Chairman to the Karnataka State Appellate Authority had not been appointed, and therefore, the petitioner had the liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal.

The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has the responsibility of ensuring that industries comply with environmental norms and regulations. The withdrawal of consent for operation granted to M/S Akash R Hanji-Sand Stone Crusher Products indicates that the Board is taking its responsibilities seriously and is willing to take action against industries that violate environmental norms.

The court's decision to dispose of the petitions and reserve the liberty to the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal is a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of both parties. The petitioner has the opportunity to seek redressal for their grievances, while the Board has the power to enforce environmental regulations and ensure compliance by industries.
