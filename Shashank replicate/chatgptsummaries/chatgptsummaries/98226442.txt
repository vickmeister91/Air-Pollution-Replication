Mubeen Shah, who was arrested in connection with a criminal case registered at Police Station: Forest Range Officer, Banapura District Hoshangabad for commission of offences punishable under Sections 2, 9, 15, 16, 20, 39, 40, 50 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, filed a repeat application for bail under Section 439 of Cr. P.C. The applicant was allegedly involved in selling meat of Black Buck (Kala Hiran) and had killed the animal. The court allowed the application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac) along with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court, and abide by certain conditions.

The court clarified that if any subsequent offence is reported against the applicant in regard to Wild Life Protection Act, then his bail is liable to be cancelled. This means that the applicant must not commit any further offences related to the Wild Life Protection Act while he is out on bail. If he does, his bail will be cancelled and he will be taken back into custody.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that protects wildlife in India. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including birds and reptiles. It also prohibits the trade in wildlife and their products. The Act is enforced by the Forest Department and the police.

The court's decision to grant bail to Mubeen Shah is based on several factors. First, the court considered the nature of the offence. Killing a Black Buck is a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, but it is not a crime that involves violence against humans. Second, the court considered the applicant's criminal record. If the applicant has a history of committing crimes, then he is more likely to commit another crime if he is released on bail. However, if the applicant has no criminal record, then he is less likely to commit another crime. Third, the court considered the evidence against the applicant. If the evidence is strong, then the court is less likely to grant bail. However, if the evidence is weak, then the court is more likely to grant bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Mubeen Shah is also subject to certain conditions. The applicant must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac) along with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. This means that the applicant must provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he will appear in court when required. If he fails to appear in court, then the money will be forfeited. The applicant must also abide by certain conditions, which may include reporting to the police station at regular intervals, surrendering his passport, and refraining from contacting certain individuals.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Mubeen Shah is based on several factors, including the nature of the offence, the applicant's criminal record, and the evidence against him. The court has also imposed certain conditions on the applicant, which he must abide by while he is out on bail. If the applicant violates any of these conditions or commits another offence related to the Wild Life Protection Act, then his bail will be cancelled and he will be taken back into custody.
