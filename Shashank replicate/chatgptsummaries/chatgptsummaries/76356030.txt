The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by B.Y. Chakresh against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had filed an application for grant of building stone quarrying lease over an area of 4 acres in Survey No.22 of Hodekallu village, Tumkur Taluk and District, which was rejected by the fourth respondent on the ground that the entire survey number is a forest land. The petitioner preferred a revision petition before the revisional authority, which was also rejected.

The petitioner relied upon a judgment and order of a Division Bench of the court, which directed a survey to be carried out to determine the extent of land out of survey No.22 which could be said to be a forest land. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the fourth respondent to consider the application made by the petitioner afresh, in the light of the survey carried out in terms of the judgment and order dated 4th February 2014 and to pass fresh orders within a period of two months from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had relied on a previous judgment and order of a Division Bench of the court, which had directed a survey to be carried out to determine the extent of land out of survey No.22 which could be said to be a forest land. The court found that the impugned orders were in violation of the previous judgment and order, and therefore quashed them.

The court's decision has significant implications for the petitioner, who will now have the opportunity to have his application for a building stone quarrying lease considered afresh. The court's decision also has wider implications for the State of Karnataka, as it highlights the importance of following previous judgments and orders of the court.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following previous judgments and orders of the court, and of the need to ensure that decisions are made in accordance with the law. It also highlights the importance of ensuring that all relevant facts are taken into account when making decisions, and of ensuring that all parties are given a fair hearing.
