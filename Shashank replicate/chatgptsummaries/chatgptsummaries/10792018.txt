The Delhi High Court recently passed a judgment in two petitions filed by the Management Committee of Ramjas Foundation against a judgment passed by the Delhi School Tribunal in favor of respondent No.1. The petitioners argued that respondent No.1 was not entitled to pay for a period of over ten years since he was not working in the school and was under suspension. They also claimed that the respondent had committed a heinous crime and violated the principles of natural justice during the disciplinary enquiry. However, the court rejected the petitioners' arguments and cited previous cases where violation of natural justice did not necessarily lead to the quashing of an order if no prejudice was caused to the person concerned.

The court order discusses exceptions to the principle that breach of natural justice is in itself prejudice. One exception is if only one conclusion is possible based on admitted or indisputable facts. The court also notes the "useless formality" theory, which is an exception to the principle, and discusses the divergent views on its application. The court then applies these principles to a specific case and finds that no evidence was recorded and the principles of natural justice were not followed, resulting in the denial of an opportunity to the respondents. The court dismisses the petitions and makes no order as to costs.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the exceptions to the principle that breach of natural justice is in itself prejudice. The court notes that if only one conclusion is possible based on admitted or indisputable facts, then the breach of natural justice may not necessarily lead to the quashing of an order. This is an important exception as it ensures that the outcome of a case is not affected by a technicality if the facts are clear and indisputable.

The court also discusses the "useless formality" theory, which is an exception to the principle that breach of natural justice is in itself prejudice. This theory suggests that if the outcome of a case would have been the same even if the principles of natural justice had been followed, then the breach of natural justice may not necessarily lead to the quashing of an order. However, the court notes that there are divergent views on the application of this theory and it is not a settled principle of law.

The court then applies these principles to the specific case at hand and finds that the principles of natural justice were not followed, resulting in the denial of an opportunity to the respondents. The court notes that no evidence was recorded and the respondents were not given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. Therefore, the court dismisses the petitions and makes no order as to costs.

Overall, the court's decision clarifies the exceptions to the principle that breach of natural justice is in itself prejudice. The court notes that if only one conclusion is possible based on admitted or indisputable facts, then the breach of natural justice may not necessarily lead to the quashing of an order. However, the court also notes that the "useless formality" theory is not a settled principle of law and there are divergent views on its application. The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and ensuring that all parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case.
