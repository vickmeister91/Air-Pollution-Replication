The Punjab-Haryana High Court has taken a significant step towards controlling noise pollution in the region by disposing of five writ petitions related to the issue. The court has formed a committee to suggest a policy for effective implementation of laws to control noise pollution in Punjab, Haryana, and Union Territory, Chandigarh. The committee has recommended sensitizing people about the hazardous effects of noise pollution, making prevention of noise pollution an integral part of the Swachh Bharat Mission, and equipping authorities with modern noise monitoring devices. It has also suggested setting up a common hotline for complaints related to noise pollution.

The court order requires a common helpline for complaints about noise pollution in the region, with a standard operating procedure for handling complaints and maintaining confidentiality of complainants. The order also outlines consequences for repeat offenders and requires places requiring permission or licenses to comply with noise regulations. The order references previous guidelines and notifications regarding noise pollution and sets limits for noise levels in different zones. The order also addresses specific cases related to noise pollution in religious institutions and marriage functions in a particular area.

The court order lists the areas in Chandigarh that are designated as residential and silence zones, and outlines the rules and regulations for controlling noise pollution in these areas. The court also notes that the governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh have not taken sufficient measures to check noise pollution, and highlights the Noise Pollution (Regulations and Control) Rules, 2000, which specify the ambient air quality standards for noise in different areas and zones. The court emphasizes the need for effective enforcement of these rules and restrictions on the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, and sound-producing instruments.

The court order states that the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, and other sound-producing instruments is prohibited without written permission from the authority. They can only be used in closed premises for communication within, and only during limited periods of festivals or special occasions for 15 days between 10 pm to 12 am. The noise level cannot exceed 10dB(A) above the ambient noise standards. The governments of Punjab, Haryana, and Union Territory, Chandigarh have not effectively enforced these rules, causing annoyance, disturbance, and discomfort to residents. The court cites the principle of strict and absolute liability for enterprises engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities, stating that they must compensate those affected by their activities. The court also directs the central government to take measures to protect and improve the environment and recover the cost of remedial measures from offending industries.

The court order also discusses the Oleum Gas Leak Case, where the respondents are liable to compensate for the harm caused to villagers, soil, and underground water. The Central Government has the power to give directions for remedial measures and levy costs. The right to life includes freedom from noise pollution, and polluters cannot take shelter under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The right to life guarantees a person's right to live with human dignity, and anyone who wishes to live in peace has the right to prevent noise pollution. The court also discusses the definition of hazardous substances and the impact of running a pathological lab. The regularisation certificate for running a nursing home cannot be accepted due to inconsistencies and lack of permission from the High Court.

The court order discusses the violation of laws and regulations by a pathological lab, including the emission of obnoxious and polluting substances, air and noise pollution, and the installation of illegal structures. The court cites various legal provisions and previous cases to support its decision to examine the case on all aspects and on merits. Additionally, the court notes the glorification of violence and drugs in songs in certain states and the need to curb the use of firearms in public gatherings.

The court order pertains to the regulation of firearms and noise pollution in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Union Territory, Chandigarh. The court has directed that no person shall carry any firearm to a fair, religious procession, or other public assemblage or within the campus or precincts of any educational institution. The court has also issued mandatory directions to regulate the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, musical instruments, and sound amplifiers during day and night time. The court has directed the licensing authorities to ensure that no license is issued to any person who has not completed the age of 21 years and to ensure that no license is issued to a person who has been sentenced on conviction of any offense involving violence or moral turpitude to imprisonment for any term at any time during a period of five years. The court has also directed the District Administration to ensure that nude posters, semi-nude posters, and obscene posters should not be fixed/displayed in any district near educational institutions.

The court has issued directions and appreciated the assistance of a committee. A copy of the order is to be sent to the Chief Secretaries of Punjab and Haryana, as well as the Home Secretary of Chandigarh for compliance. The order was issued on July 22, 2019, and it is not clear if it is a reasoned or reportable decision.

In summary, the Punjab-Haryana High Court has taken a comprehensive approach to controlling noise pollution in the region. The court has formed a committee to suggest a policy for effective implementation of laws to control noise pollution and has issued several orders to regulate the use of loudspeakers, public address systems, musical instruments, and sound amplifiers.
