The first court order pertains to an appeal filed by Shri Om Prakash and others against the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The plaintiffs had filed a suit claiming ownership and seeking injunction against any demolition or coercive action against their property. The suit was dismissed by the trial court for lack of statutory notice to the defendants. The plaintiffs challenged this decision in the appeal.

The court order details the background of the case, the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs, and the issues framed by the trial court. The plaintiffs had claimed that they were the owners of the property in question and that the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had no right to demolish or take any coercive action against it. They had sought an injunction against the corporation to prevent them from taking any such action.

The trial court had dismissed the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs had not given statutory notice to the defendants before filing the suit. The plaintiffs had argued that the notice was not required as they were the owners of the property and the defendants had no right to it. However, the trial court had rejected this argument and dismissed the suit.

In the appeal, the plaintiffs challenged the decision of the trial court. The court order notes that the plaintiffs had not produced any evidence to support their claim of ownership. The court also notes that the plaintiffs had not produced any evidence to show that the defendants had no right to the property.

The court order further notes that the plaintiffs had not produced any evidence to show that the notice was not required. The court observes that the plaintiffs had not even produced a copy of the notice that they claimed to have sent to the defendants.

The court order concludes that the plaintiffs had failed to produce any evidence to support their claim. The court notes that the trial court had rightly dismissed the suit for lack of statutory notice. The court dismisses the appeal and upholds the decision of the trial court.

The second court order pertains to a case where the defendant had filed an application to set aside an ex-parte order and the case was adjourned for evidence of the plaintiff. The court questions why the issues were framed again when they had already been framed earlier and why a preliminary issue was framed when it had already been observed that the controversy on the maintainability of the suit and jurisdiction of the civil court would be decided after evidence is led by both parties.

The court sets aside the order and restores the suit to its original number, directing the trial court to decide the suit afresh after evidence is led by the parties. The parties are directed to appear before the trial court on a specified date.

Both orders highlight the importance of presenting proper evidence in court proceedings.
