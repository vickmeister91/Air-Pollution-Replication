The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Deepkantesh Gautam against an order passed by the JMFC, Hoshangabad in a complaint case. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for the record of the bank account of the complainant, which was rejected by the court. The court stated that such records can only be called for at the time of defense and not during the initial stage of the case. The petitioner was allowed to file the application again at the time of entering into defense.

The case in question involved a complaint filed by the complainant against the petitioner, alleging that the petitioner had cheated him out of a sum of money. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for the record of the complainant's bank account, in order to prove that the complainant had received the money that he was alleging had been cheated from him. However, the court rejected the application, stating that such records can only be called for at the time of defense and not during the initial stage of the case.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not yet entered into defense, and therefore, the records of the complainant's bank account could not be called for at this stage. The court stated that the petitioner would be allowed to file the application again at the time of entering into defense, when he would have the opportunity to present his case and evidence.

The court's decision was in line with the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C., which states that any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, summon any person as a witness or call for any document or thing necessary for the purpose of such inquiry, trial or other proceeding. However, the court also noted that this provision does not give the petitioner the right to call for the record of the complainant's bank account at the initial stage of the case.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and the circumstances under which records of bank accounts can be called for in a criminal case. It also highlights the importance of presenting evidence at the appropriate stage of the case, and the need for parties to follow the procedures laid down by law.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for the record of the complainant's bank account was based on the fact that such records can only be called for at the time of defense and not during the initial stage of the case. The court's decision is in line with the provisions of the law and highlights the importance of following the procedures laid down by law in criminal cases.
