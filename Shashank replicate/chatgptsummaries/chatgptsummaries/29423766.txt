To understand the court order, it is important to first understand the context of the case. The CBI had sought the production of a search list dated 28.03.1987 from the court of ld. Special Judge, (PC Act), CBI-3, Patiala House Court and to recall PW-9 Prakash Chander for re-examination. The accused had filed a reply to the application taking preliminary objections that Section 311 CrPC and Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act are not applicable. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate had dismissed the application of CBI under Section 311 Criminal Procedure Code r/w Section 91 Criminal Procedure Code and Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act.

The CBI then filed a revision petition against this order, seeking to have it overturned. However, the court order states that the revision petition is not maintainable, as it is barred under Section 397 (2) CrPC. This section states that no revision shall be entertained against any order made by a court inferior to a Court of Session or by a Court of Session or a High Court if an appeal lies against such order.

In other words, the court order is saying that the CBI should have appealed the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's order instead of filing a revision petition. Since the CBI did not do so, the revision petition is not maintainable and is dismissed.

This court order highlights the importance of understanding the legal procedures and requirements for filing appeals and revision petitions. It also emphasizes the need for careful consideration of the grounds on which such petitions are filed, as well as the potential consequences of not following proper legal procedures.
