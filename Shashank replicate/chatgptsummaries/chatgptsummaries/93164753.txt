The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions and a public interest litigation filed against Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Limited, a sugar factory located in the state of Maharashtra, India. The petitions challenge the grant of aerial distance certificates, construction of a sugar factory, and dumping of waste products into the Aashti water reservoir. The court heard all the matters together and disposed of them by a common judgment.

The court order lists the parties involved in three writ petitions: WP.135 of 2013 group, WRIT PETITION NO. 6799 OF 2010, and WRIT PETITION NO. 4773 OF 2010. The petitioners and respondents are listed for each case. The order also lists several cases involving Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd. and various petitioners and respondents, including government officials and other individuals. The cases involve issues related to sugar production and distribution in the state of Maharashtra.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd. against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., and the Union of India. The petitioners have also filed a separate writ petition against various government officials and agencies. The details of the case are not provided in the summary.

The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, as long as they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji ultimately receiving one and beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and others, leading to a court order restraining Audumbarraoji from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained. The Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice for objections, and nine were received, mostly from the petitioners in the present writ petitions/PIL.

The court order specifies that effective steps must be taken within two years and commercial production must commence within four years of filing the Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum with the Central Government. Failure to do so will result in the memorandum being de-recognized and the performance guarantee being forfeited. An extension of one year may be granted by the Chief Director (Sugar) on the recommendation of the concerned State Government. If the memorandum remains unimplemented within the specified time, the performance guarantee will be forfeited. The order also applies to those whose memorandum has already been acknowledged but who have not taken effective steps. The objections to the license granted to Audumbarraoji will be considered in the light of these provisions. The court also heard arguments regarding the grant of aerial distance certificates to Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji.

The court order discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court considers the provisions of the Sugarcane Control Order and a previous court decision in Gangamai. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was first in point of time and therefore justified. The court also rejects Lokshakti's argument that Audumbarraoji's application was erroneously granted due to a change in name.

The court order pertains to a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other. The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their factories at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The petitioner argued that the IEM granted to one factory had become inoperative as they had not taken effective steps within the stipulated time period. The court rejected this argument and found that the IEM was still valid.

The court order discusses a case involving a sugar factory and its compliance with government regulations regarding minimum distance between factories. The court considers arguments from both sides and ultimately concludes that the factory's change in location is permissible under a government press note, and that the change should be treated as an amendment to the factory's initial application rather than a new application altogether. The court also notes that a public interest litigation filed against the factory was premature, as the factory had not yet begun its first crushing season at the time of the filing.

The court order discusses a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application for an amendment to their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM) to correct the location of their proposed sugar factory. The court determines that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement dated January 12, 2006, was to be treated as a fresh IEM registered in favor of Jaywant for the first time. The court also considers whether Audumbarraoji has taken effective steps within the stipulated period of two years from the date of IEM and concludes that they have. The court dismisses a public interest litigation and a writ petition filed by Grampanchayat Aashti seeking to stop construction activity on land Gat No. 195(3), situated at Aashti, taluka Mohol, district Solapur.

The court order discusses a case involving the construction of a sugar factory on agricultural
