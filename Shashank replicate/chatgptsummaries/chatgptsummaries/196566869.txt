The court order in question pertains to a recall application filed by Mr. Aman Sethi, the sole proprietor of M/s. FGM Mining & Infrastructure Co., challenging the communications issued by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) banning all stone crushing units in Village Mungaska Tehsil Pahari. The writ petition was withdrawn on 16-4-2013 with liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal. The applicant approached the Principal Seat of the Tribunal at New Delhi in appeal No.61/2013, which was dismissed for reason of the appeal not having been filed within the limitation provided under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The applicant has been rendered remedyless in its challenge to the illegal and arbitrary communications dated 11-9-2012 and 6-11-2012, and his right to run the stone crusher in village Mungaska, Tehsil Pahari District Bharatpur set up with due compliances required in law has been denied. The court dismissed the application for recall.

The case revolves around the issue of stone crushing units in Village Mungaska Tehsil Pahari, and the communications issued by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) banning all such units. Mr. Aman Sethi, the sole proprietor of M/s. FGM Mining & Infrastructure Co., had set up a stone crusher in the village with due compliances required in law. However, the RSPCB issued communications on 11-9-2012 and 6-11-2012 banning all stone crushing units in the village, which Mr. Sethi challenged through a writ petition.

The writ petition was withdrawn on 16-4-2013 with liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal. Mr. Sethi then approached the Principal Seat of the Tribunal at New Delhi in appeal No.61/2013, which was dismissed for reason of the appeal not having been filed within the limitation provided under Section 16 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. This left Mr. Sethi remedyless in his challenge to the communications issued by the RSPCB, and his right to run the stone crusher in village Mungaska, Tehsil Pahari District Bharatpur was denied.

Mr. Sethi then filed a recall application in the court, seeking to challenge the communications issued by the RSPCB and to assert his right to run the stone crusher in the village. However, the court dismissed the application for recall, leaving Mr. Sethi with no legal recourse.

This case highlights the importance of timely filing of appeals and the limitations provided under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. It also raises questions about the arbitrary nature of the communications issued by the RSPCB, and the impact of such communications on the livelihoods of individuals and businesses. The denial of Mr. Sethi's right to run the stone crusher in the village raises concerns about the balance between environmental protection and economic development, and the need for a more nuanced approach to regulating industries in sensitive areas.
