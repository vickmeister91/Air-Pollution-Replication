The court order in question pertains to a case where an assessee claimed that their cinema building, furniture, and fixtures should be considered as "plant" for the purposes of depreciation allowances and development rebate. The Income-tax Officer rejected this claim, but the Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) directed the allowance of development rebate and depreciation as claimed by the assessee. The Revenue filed further appeals before the Tribunal, which held that the entire cinema theatre cannot be considered as a plant, but certain parts of it, such as the screening wall and the ceiling of the auditorium, could be treated as plant.

The court applied the functional test to determine whether a building or structure constitutes "plant" and concluded that the screening wall and ceiling of the auditorium could be treated as part of "plant," but no other part of the building could be included in the said term. The furniture, fittings, and fixtures consisting of wooden walls, including false ceiling and wooden paneling of the walls, and the chairs would come within the purview of "plant" for development rebate.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the functional test when determining whether a building or structure can be considered as "plant" for the purposes of depreciation allowances and development rebate. The functional test involves examining the purpose for which the building or structure is used and whether it is integral to the assessee's business operations.

In this case, the court found that the screening wall and ceiling of the auditorium were integral to the functioning of the cinema theatre and therefore could be considered as part of "plant." However, other parts of the building, such as the walls and flooring, were not integral to the functioning of the cinema theatre and therefore could not be included in the said term.

The court's decision has important implications for businesses that own and operate buildings or structures that are used for business purposes. It underscores the need to carefully consider the functional test when determining whether a building or structure can be considered as "plant" for the purposes of depreciation allowances and development rebate.

Overall, the court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the application of the functional test in determining whether a building or structure can be considered as "plant" for the purposes of depreciation allowances and development rebate. It highlights the need for businesses to carefully consider the purpose for which a building or structure is used and whether it is integral to their business operations when making such determinations.
