Arjun Sampath, the petitioner, filed a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to prevent the respondents from interfering with his right to deal with a property in Coimbatore. The petitioner had been facing harassment from the police when he wanted to undertake renovation work on the property. The government advocate representing the respondents stated that people from the management of Perur Temple in Coimbatore claimed ownership over the property and had complained to the police, leading to their intervention.

The court directed the police to issue summons to both parties under Section 160 and 91 of Cr.P.C. asking them to appear for an enquiry, and thereafter, take action in accordance with the law. Section 160 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers the police to require the attendance of witnesses and Section 91 empowers the police to issue summons to produce documents or other things.

The petitioner had claimed that he had purchased the property in question from its previous owner and had all the necessary documents to prove his ownership. However, the respondents had claimed that the property belonged to the Perur Temple and that the petitioner had no right to deal with it.

The court observed that the dispute was essentially a civil dispute over the ownership of the property and that the police had no role to play in it. The court directed the police to issue summons to both parties and asked them to appear for an enquiry. The court also directed the police to take action in accordance with the law after the enquiry.

The court further observed that the police should not interfere in civil disputes unless there is a clear violation of the law. The court also noted that the police should not take sides in such disputes and should act impartially.

The writ petition was closed with no costs. The court's decision was a significant one as it reaffirmed the principle that the police should not interfere in civil disputes unless there is a clear violation of the law. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of impartiality on the part of the police in such disputes.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Arjun Sampath v. The State of Tamil Nadu was a significant one as it reaffirmed the principle that the police should not interfere in civil disputes unless there is a clear violation of the law. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of impartiality on the part of the police in such disputes. The court's direction to issue summons to both parties and to take action in accordance with the law after the enquiry was a fair and just decision that upheld the rule of law.
