The case in question involves a challenge to an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Balotara in Sessions Case No. 24/2016. The petitioner, Vishna Ram, had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the hand-written report allegedly submitted by the prosecution witness No.1 Purkharam to the SHO Police Station, Kalyanpur. However, this application was dismissed by the judge.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the FIR exhibited by the prosecution during the statement of the witness was computerized, and there existed every possibility of embellishments having been made in the said typed report. The petitioner believed that the hand-written report would provide a more accurate account of the events in question.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the trial court. The court directed the trial court to seek a specific explanation from the I.O. regarding the facts mentioned in the application filed by the accused under Section 91. The trial court was then instructed to decide the application afresh as per law after providing opportunity of hearing to the parties.

This decision by the court highlights the importance of ensuring that all evidence presented in a case is accurate and reliable. The petitioner's argument that the hand-written report would provide a more accurate account of the events in question is a valid one, and the court's decision to remand the matter to the trial court for further consideration is a step in the right direction.

It is important for the trial court to carefully consider all evidence presented in a case, and to ensure that any discrepancies or inaccuracies are addressed. This will help to ensure that justice is served and that the rights of all parties involved are protected.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of accuracy and reliability in the legal system. It is essential that all evidence presented in a case is thoroughly examined and evaluated, and that any discrepancies or inaccuracies are addressed in a timely and appropriate manner.
