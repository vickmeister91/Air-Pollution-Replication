The court order pertains to two writ petitions filed by a group of petitioners against the State of Maharashtra and various government officials. The issue at hand is the rehabilitation of families affected by the declaration of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary. The government had offered compensation packages of Rs. 10 lakhs per family, but the petitioners claim that some widows have not received any compensation. The court is hearing both petitions together and has issued an oral judgment.

The court order dismisses both writ petitions and denies relief to the petitioners. The court found that the expression "family" in a government resolution includes a major son, and since the respective family units have already been granted compensation, the petitioners cannot be considered a separate family unit. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to any relief.

The court order pertains to a case where widows who have not received compensation are seeking relief in terms of a government resolution. The petitioners argue that they are entitled to compensation as a separate family unit, while the government argues that they have already been compensated as part of their respective family units. The court finds that the definition of "family" in the government resolution includes widows residing with their family units, and that the petitioners have already been compensated as part of their respective family units. The court also notes that the communication recommending separate compensation for widows does not create any right in favor of the petitioners.

The court's decision is based on the interpretation of the government resolution and the definition of "family" within it. The court found that the government resolution includes widows residing with their family units, and therefore, the petitioners have already been compensated as part of their respective family units. The court also noted that the communication recommending separate compensation for widows does not create any right in favor of the petitioners.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the definition of "family" in the government resolution and provides guidance on the interpretation of such resolutions. The court's decision also highlights the importance of clear communication and documentation in government policies and resolutions.

Overall, the court order dismisses both writ petitions and denies relief to the petitioners. The court found that the petitioners have already been compensated as part of their respective family units and that they cannot be considered a separate family unit. The court's decision is based on the interpretation of the government resolution and provides guidance on the interpretation of such resolutions.
