The court order in question pertains to a complaint made by a complainant against two accused individuals, one of whom allegedly paid a bribe to the other to secure a position in a village Panchayat Court. The complaint was returned by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for want of sanction from the Local Government, as the offence fell under Section 171 E of the Indian Penal Code. However, the court notes that the complainant had made the complaint under Section 161 of the IPC, which is still in force and has not been repealed by anything in Act XXXIX of 1920. The court states that if the complainant can establish the accused's responsibility under Section 161, there is nothing in law to prevent him from doing so. The court advises the complainant to obtain the necessary sanction and proceed with the complaint.

To understand the court order, it is important to first understand the sections of the Indian Penal Code that are being referred to. Section 161 of the IPC deals with the offence of taking a bribe, while Section 171 E deals with the offence of bribery at elections. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate had returned the complaint as it fell under Section 171 E, which required sanction from the Local Government to proceed with the case. However, the court notes that the complainant had made the complaint under Section 161, which does not require such sanction.

The court's advice to the complainant is based on the fact that Section 161 is still in force and has not been repealed by anything in Act XXXIX of 1920. This means that if the complainant can establish the accused's responsibility under Section 161, there is nothing in law to prevent him from doing so. The court is essentially saying that the complainant should pursue the case under Section 161, as it does not require sanction from the Local Government.

The court's order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the use of Section 161 in cases of bribery. It also highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary sanction before proceeding with a case, as failure to do so can result in the case being returned. The court's advice to the complainant to obtain the necessary sanction and proceed with the complaint is a reminder of the importance of following due process in legal proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a complaint made by a complainant against two accused individuals for bribery. The complaint was returned by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for want of sanction from the Local Government, but the court notes that the complainant had made the complaint under Section 161 of the IPC, which does not require such sanction.
