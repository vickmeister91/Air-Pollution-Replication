The case in question involves a petitioner who filed a miscellaneous petition challenging an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge No.2 in Sri Ganganagar. The petitioner had previously filed a revision petition challenging an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, also in Sri Ganganagar in Criminal Case No.699/2006. The petitioner claimed that the respondent was involved in the business of money lending without holding a valid license and had filed 35-40 complaints under the Negotiable Instruments Act against various persons.

The trial court had rejected the petitioner's application under Sections 91 and 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to order production of documents or other things, while Section 311 deals with the power of the court to summon material witnesses or examine a person present in court. The court had directed that the petitioner could file applications for being supplied with certified copies of the complaints filed by the respondent in various courts below.

The court further directed that the petitioner be granted a period of two months from the date of the order to procure the certified copies of the complaints and place them on record of the trial court. The complaint filed in the instant case was to be proceeded with expeditiously.

The order passed by the trial court is significant as it allows the petitioner to obtain certified copies of the complaints filed by the respondent in various courts below. This will enable the petitioner to build a stronger case against the respondent and provide evidence to support their claims. The court's direction to proceed with the complaint expeditiously also ensures that justice is not delayed and the matter is resolved in a timely manner.

It is important to note that the court did not make any findings on the merits of the case at this stage. The order only pertains to the petitioner's application for certified copies of the complaints filed by the respondent and the direction to proceed with the complaint expeditiously. The case will continue to be heard by the trial court, and the petitioner will have to provide evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, the order passed by the trial court in this case allows the petitioner to obtain certified copies of the complaints filed by the respondent in various courts below. This will enable the petitioner to build a stronger case against the respondent and provide evidence to support their claims. The court's direction to proceed with the complaint expeditiously also ensures that justice is not delayed and the matter is resolved in a timely manner.
