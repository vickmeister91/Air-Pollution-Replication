The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to the felling of trees in private non-forest plantations in the state of West Bengal, India. The first court order involves an appeal by a landowner who had been prevented from felling trees by local authorities. The High Court had permitted the landowner to fell trees subject to certain conditions and restrictions, which the landowner challenged in this appeal. The court held that there is no statutory or enacted law requiring permission to fell trees in a private plantation that is not a forest, and therefore the High Court could not have imposed restrictions and conditions.

The second court order involves a ban on the felling of Mahua and Kendu trees in the state, which was imposed in 1998. The ban required permission from local authorities or District Forest Officers for cutting any other trees. However, a later Division Bench judgment and the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad case were not considered in the decision. The High Court observed that the ban did not apply to non-forest private plantations, but the Division Bench believed that Section 4-B of the Act prohibited the felling of trees without permission from the Collector. However, the court cannot expand the scope of Section 4-A beyond the three sub-divisions of Darjeeling District, and Sections 4-B and 4-C do not require permission for felling trees in non-forest private plantations. The court cannot legislate and must interpret the statute according to its plain reading.

The third court order states that the ban on felling trees in forests does not extend to non-forest private plantations, and there is no state law regarding the felling of trees in such areas. The High Court was wrong in imposing restrictions on the landowner for felling trees in his private non-forest garden land. The court suggests that the state government should consider enacting a comprehensive law regarding felling of trees in non-forest areas. Until such a law is enacted, no permission is required for felling trees in non-forest private plantations. The appeal is allowed, and no costs are imposed.

In summary, the court orders clarify that there is no statutory or enacted law requiring permission to fell trees in private non-forest plantations in West Bengal. The ban on felling trees in forests does not extend to non-forest private plantations, and there is no state law regarding the felling of trees in such areas. The court suggests that the state government should consider enacting a comprehensive law regarding felling of trees in non-forest areas. Until such a law is enacted, no permission is required for felling trees in non-forest private plantations. These court orders provide clarity and guidance for landowners in West Bengal regarding the felling of trees in their private non-forest plantations.
