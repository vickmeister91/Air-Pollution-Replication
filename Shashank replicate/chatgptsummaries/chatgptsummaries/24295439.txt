The case at hand involves a criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioner, Shyam Prakash, under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Churu, affirming the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Sardarsahar, rejecting his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The petitioner had sought the production of mark-sheets and educational certificates in original, which he claimed were must documents for his defence.

The court, in its ruling, held that invocation of the power under Section 91 Cr.P.C. would not be proper at this stage and dismissed the petition. However, the court did allow the petitioner to take his defence in further proceedings.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is intended to enable the court to secure the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents or things that may be necessary for the just decision of a case.

In this case, the petitioner had sought the production of his mark-sheets and educational certificates in original, claiming that they were essential documents for his defence. However, the court held that the invocation of Section 91 Cr.P.C. would not be proper at this stage.

The court's ruling was based on the fact that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents in question through other means. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any request to the educational institution where he had obtained his qualifications for the production of the documents. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain certified copies of the documents from the institution.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through the process of discovery under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court held that the petitioner could have sought the production of the documents through the process of discovery, which would have enabled him to obtain the documents from the prosecution.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through the process of inspection under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court held that the petitioner could have sought the inspection of the documents, which would have enabled him to examine the documents in the custody of the prosecution.

Based on these observations, the court held that the invocation of Section 91 Cr.P.C. would not be proper at this stage. The court noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means and that he had not demonstrated that the documents were essential for his defence.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 Cr.P.C. However, the court did allow the petitioner to take his defence in further proceedings. This means that the petitioner will have the opportunity to present his defence in the trial court, even though he will not have access to the original mark-sheets and educational certificates.

In conclusion, the court's ruling in this case highlights the importance of making efforts to obtain necessary documents through other means before invoking Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court's ruling also underscores the importance of demonstrating the essential nature of the documents for the defence of the accused. While the court did not allow the petitioner's request for the production of the original mark-sheets and educational certificates, it did allow him to present his defence in further proceedings.
