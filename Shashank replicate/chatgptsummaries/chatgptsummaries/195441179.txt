The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had filed an appeal against an order that had set aside the conviction of Vikash Bansal for violating the Water Pollution and Control Act. Bansal, in turn, had filed a petition against the order that upheld his conviction for violating a different section of the same Act. However, the parties were able to settle their dispute through mediation, and Bansal agreed to pay a sum of Rs. 7.5 lakhs to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, plant 100 trees, and install an Effluent Treatment Plant.

The court accepted the settlement agreement and acquitted Bansal of all charges. Additionally, the Trial Court was directed to refund Rs. 2 lakhs that had been deposited by Bansal. This case highlights the importance of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, which can help parties reach a mutually beneficial agreement without the need for a lengthy and costly court battle.

The Water Pollution and Control Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to regulate and control water pollution in India. It sets out various provisions and guidelines for the prevention and control of water pollution, including the establishment of pollution control boards at the state and central levels. The Act also provides for the punishment of those who violate its provisions, including fines and imprisonment.

In this case, Bansal had been convicted of violating the Water Pollution and Control Act, but the order had been set aside on appeal. However, Bansal had also been convicted of violating a different section of the same Act, which had been upheld by the court. It is not clear from the available information what specific violations Bansal had been charged with, but it is likely that they related to the discharge of effluents or other pollutants into water bodies.

The settlement agreement reached between Bansal and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee is a positive development, as it demonstrates a willingness on both sides to resolve the dispute amicably. Bansal's agreement to pay a sum of Rs. 7.5 lakhs to the Committee, plant 100 trees, and install an Effluent Treatment Plant shows a commitment to environmental protection and sustainability. The Committee, in turn, agreed to accept the settlement and drop all charges against Bansal.

The court's acceptance of the settlement agreement and acquittal of Bansal of all charges is a significant outcome, as it brings closure to the dispute and avoids the need for further litigation. The direction to refund Rs. 2 lakhs deposited by Bansal is also a welcome relief for him, as it reduces the financial burden of the case.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as the potential benefits of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation. It also underscores the need for a collaborative approach to environmental protection, with both individuals and regulatory bodies working together to ensure a sustainable future for all.
