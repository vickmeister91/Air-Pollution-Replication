The court order in question pertains to a dispute between Essar Oil Ltd. and Halar Utkarsh Samiti & Ors. regarding the laying of pipelines to pump crude oil from a single buoy mooring in the Gulf across a portion of the Marine National Park and Marine Sanctuary to their oil refineries in Jamnagar District. The court examines the interpretation of provisions of three statutes, namely the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and concludes that clearance under each of the three statutes is essential before any activity otherwise prohibited under those Acts may be proceeded with.

The court also examines the interpretation of Section 29 of the WPA and holds that the marine sanctuary and marine national park were not to be utilized for any purpose other than the purposes prescribed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and except in accordance with Sections 26-A (3), 30 and Section 35(6) thereof. The court finds that the prohibition under Section 29 is not absolute and permits may be granted for certain activities, but only if they are necessary for the improvement and better management of wild life. The court emphasizes the need to balance economic development with environmental considerations. The court ultimately concludes that the laying of pipelines through a sanctuary does not necessarily result in the destruction of wild life and that permits may be granted subject to certain conditions.

The court order also discusses the regulations and requirements for laying pipelines in ecologically sensitive areas. The government must ensure that the pipeline does not interfere with sustainable development and may impose further stipulations. The Pipelines Act, 1962 covers the laying of pipelines across the country. The court emphasizes the need to consider the impact on wildlife and the environment before granting permission. The State Government must obtain an environmental impact report from expert bodies and the applicant must provide an environmental management plan. The court also highlights the importance of transparency and public awareness in the decision-making process.

The court then discusses the specific case of the appellant's proposal to lay pipelines in the Marine National Park and Sanctuary area at Vadinar. The appellant was granted permission by the State Government under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, subject to compliance with various conditions and environmental safeguards. The permission is subject to clearance under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the appellant had invested a significant amount of money in setting up the project. The court found that the grant of permission under the Wild Life (Protection) Act was valid, and there was no irreversible damage to the habitat or destruction of wildlife. The court also noted that the State Government and the appellant had taken precautions to minimize damage to wildlife.

The court set aside the impugned decision of the High Court and directed the State Government to issue formal authorization to regularize the de facto permission. The court also remanded the matter back to the High Court to determine any outstanding factual controversies.

In summary, the court order deals with a dispute between Essar Oil Ltd. and Halar Utkarsh Samiti & Ors. regarding the laying of pipelines through a sanctuary. The court examines the interpretation of provisions of three statutes, namely the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and concludes that clearance under each of the three statutes is essential before any activity otherwise prohibited under those Acts may be proceeded with.
