The case at hand involves a petition filed by Lalit Ajmera under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside an order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate (N.I. Act Cases) No.2, Jaipur Metropolitan. The complainant, Bajranglal Choudhary, had filed a complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, alleging that the cheque issued by the accused-petitioner had bounced. During cross-examination, the counsel for the accused had requested the complainant to produce bills, income-tax returns, receipts, record regarding dispatch of goods, phone number list, and Bilti/GR receipts. An application was filed under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the above record, which was dismissed by the trial Judge vide impugned order dated 19.2.2018. The trial Judge held that the documents are not relevant for adjudication of the complaint under Section 138, N.I. Act. The court dismissed the present petition as it was devoid of merit.

The petitioner had argued that the trial Judge had erred in dismissing the application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the documents. The petitioner had contended that the documents were necessary for the proper adjudication of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had further argued that the trial Judge had failed to appreciate the relevance of the documents and had wrongly held that they were not necessary for the adjudication of the complaint.

The court, however, did not find merit in the petitioner's arguments and dismissed the petition. The court held that the trial Judge had correctly applied the law and had rightly held that the documents were not relevant for the adjudication of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court observed that the documents sought by the petitioner were not directly related to the issue of dishonour of the cheque and were therefore not necessary for the adjudication of the complaint.

The court further observed that the scope of Section 91 Cr.P.C. is limited to the production of documents that are necessary for the proper adjudication of a case. The court held that the trial Judge had correctly applied this principle and had rightly held that the documents sought by the petitioner were not necessary for the adjudication of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by Lalit Ajmera as it was devoid of merit. The court held that the trial Judge had correctly applied the law and had rightly held that the documents sought by the petitioner were not relevant for the adjudication of the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court reiterated that the scope of Section 91 Cr.P.C. is limited to the production of documents that are necessary for the proper adjudication of a case and that the trial Judge had correctly applied this principle.
