The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Kanti Lal against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state pollution control board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

In addition, the court has ordered the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water, analyze them, and provide reports. The court also directed the state to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal. The state and local authorities were instructed to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this direction. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of WP No. 718/2009. The NGT ordered the state to furnish copies of compliance reports and remove encroachments. The court also directed the state to submit a long-term and short-term scheme and an action report. The District Collector of Ganga Nagar was ordered to be present with relevant records on the next posting date.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and the steps being taken to mark and remove them. A committee was constituted to demarcate the encroachments and monitor their removal. The court directed the removal of all encroachments within one month and ordered various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to collect compensation from them. The compliance report filed by the State Government was found to be inadequate, and the court ordered a senior responsible officer to file a detailed affidavit.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal to provide relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which this principle may be ignored.

Finally, the court order discusses a case where an original applicant filed a petition for writ alleging violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court transferred the case to the tribunal, which has jurisdiction over civil cases involving a substantial question relating to the environment. The tribunal has the power to condone the delay in filing the application within the prescribed limitation. The court dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay and is expected to consider the application/representations filed by the petitioner sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until 31st December 2016.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district and the steps being taken to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court has directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples, construct waste water drains, and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal.
