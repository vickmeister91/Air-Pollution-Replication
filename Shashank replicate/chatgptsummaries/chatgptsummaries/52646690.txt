In a recent court order, three women were granted interim pre-arrest bail in connection with a case under Sections 376 (E)/326 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) read with Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The women had filed a petition seeking pre-arrest bail, and the court has called for the case diary to review the details of the case.

The court has granted interim pre-arrest bail to the petitioners on certain conditions. The women are required to appear before the Investigating Officer within seven days and are not allowed to hamper the investigation in any manner. The court has also directed the women to cooperate with the investigation and to not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

The case pertains to allegations of sexual assault and causing grievous hurt to a minor. The women have been accused of committing the crime along with a man who is currently in police custody. The police have stated that the women were involved in the planning and execution of the crime.

The court's decision to review the case diary indicates that the court is taking a careful and considered approach to the case.

The case highlights the importance of the POCSO Act in protecting children from sexual offenses. The act provides for stringent punishment for those who commit sexual offenses against children and also provides for the establishment of special courts to handle such cases. The act also provides for the protection of the identity of the child victim and the witnesses.

The court's decision to grant interim pre-arrest bail to the women is in line with the principles of natural justice. The women have not been convicted of any crime, and it is important that they are given the opportunity to defend themselves.
