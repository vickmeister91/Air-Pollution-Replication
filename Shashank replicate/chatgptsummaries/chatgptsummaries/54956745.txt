The court order provides details of the raid conducted by CBI officials, the seizure of the shawls, and the subsequent investigation.

The court heard testimony from witnesses who were involved in the raid and from a witness who had no knowledge of the accused's business. The accused was arrested, and their personal belongings were searched. The court order describes the proceedings of a case against two accused individuals who were summoned after a complaint was filed. The complainant and several witnesses testified, including members of the CBI who conducted a raid on a shop and seized 17 Shahtoosh shawls.

The court order pertains to the case of CBI vs. Sunita Kumar, where Sunita Kumar was charged with contravention of provisions of section 49 and 49B(1) of the Wildlife Act for possession of shahtoosh shawls, which are banned under the Act. The court heard pre-charge evidence from several witnesses and framed a charge against Sunita Kumar. Post-charge evidence was also heard, and Sunita Kumar denied all allegations and chose not to lead defense evidence. The court considered relevant provisions of the Act and heard arguments from both parties before making a decision.

The court order pertains to the case of accused Sunita Kumar, who was found in possession of shahtoosh shawls, which are made from the hair of the Tibetan antelope, a scheduled animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused has failed to rebut the presumption of unlawful possession under Section 57 of the Act. The court has dismissed the defense's argument that the witnesses are all CBI officials and has held that minor contradictions and discrepancies in their testimony do not shake the basic version of the prosecution case. The accused has been convicted for offenses under the Wildlife Protection Act.

The court order states that during cross-examination, the defense counsel did not provide any evidence to suggest why the witnesses were testifying against the accused. The witnesses supported the prosecution's case regarding the recovery of shahtoosh shawls and their trade, and their statements were found to be consistent and credible.
