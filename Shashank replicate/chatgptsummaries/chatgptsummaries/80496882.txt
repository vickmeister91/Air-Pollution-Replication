The court order in question pertains to two criminal original petitions filed by T. Nandha Kumar against S. Ramesh. The case revolves around a loan of Rs. 7.5 lakhs that Nandha Kumar had borrowed from Ramesh and a post-dated cheque that he had issued for the same amount. The cheque was returned due to insufficient funds, and Ramesh issued a notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act and lodged a prosecution against Nandha Kumar.

During the trial, Nandha Kumar filed an application to recall PW-1 for further cross-examination, which was dismissed by the trial court. Nandha Kumar then filed two petitions to set aside the orders and allow the recall of PW-1. However, the court found that Nandha Kumar had not made out a prima facie case for summoning the documents under Section 91 Cr.PC and dismissed the petitions.

The court's decision was based on the fact that Nandha Kumar had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim that the documents he sought were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial. The court noted that the documents in question were not directly related to the case and that Nandha Kumar had not provided any compelling reasons for their production.

The court also observed that the trial court had already given Nandha Kumar ample opportunity to cross-examine PW-1 and that his application to recall the witness was nothing more than an attempt to delay the proceedings. The court noted that the right to cross-examine a witness is not absolute and that it must be exercised within the framework of the law.

The court's decision to dismiss Nandha Kumar's petitions was based on the principle that the right to recall a witness is not absolute and must be exercised judiciously. The court noted that the trial court had already given Nandha Kumar ample opportunity to cross-examine PW-1 and that his application to recall the witness was nothing more than an attempt to delay the proceedings.

The court also directed the trial court to complete the trial within three months. This was done to ensure that justice was not delayed and that the trial was conducted in a timely and efficient manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the principle that the right to recall a witness is not absolute and must be exercised judiciously. The court found that Nandha Kumar had not made out a prima facie case for summoning the documents under Section 91 Cr.PC and dismissed his petitions. The court also directed the trial court to complete the trial within three months to ensure that justice was not delayed.
