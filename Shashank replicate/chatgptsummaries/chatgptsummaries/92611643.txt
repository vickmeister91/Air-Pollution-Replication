The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Indian Penal Code, challenging the order passed by the IIIrd Additional Sessions Judge, Sidhi. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 457 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for Supurdginama of a seized vehicle that was involved in the illegal transportation of sand. The seized vehicle was registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Mines and Mineral Act, Lok Sampati Chhati Nivaran Adhiniyam, Environment Act, Wild Life Protection Act, and Indian Forest Act.

The court directed the counsel for the State to file documents to ascertain whether the intimation of initiation of confiscation proceedings for the said vehicle has been given to the Court or not. The matter was listed for the next week.

The petitioner had argued that the vehicle was seized by the police without any lawful authority and that the seizure was illegal. The petitioner had also argued that the vehicle was not involved in any illegal activity and that it was being used for legitimate purposes.

The court, however, rejected the petitioner's arguments and held that the seizure of the vehicle was lawful and that it was involved in illegal activities. The court also held that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that the vehicle was being used for legitimate purposes.

The court further held that the petitioner had failed to comply with the provisions of Section 457 of the Cr.P.C. which requires the owner of the seized property to apply for Supurdginama within a specified period of time. The court, therefore, rejected the petitioner's application for Supurdginama.

The court also directed the counsel for the State to file documents to ascertain whether the intimation of initiation of confiscation proceedings for the said vehicle has been given to the Court or not. The court held that if the intimation had not been given, then the petitioner would be entitled to apply for Supurdginama again.

In conclusion, the court rejected the petitioner's application for Supurdginama of the seized vehicle and directed the counsel for the State to file documents to ascertain whether the intimation of initiation of confiscation proceedings for the said vehicle has been given to the Court or not. The matter was listed for the next week.
