The case at hand involves a dispute between the complainant and the accused over a suit property. The petitioner is challenging two orders passed by the ACMM and the ASJ in relation to this dispute. The primary order being challenged is the order of the ACMM dated 7th August 2013, which the petitioner is seeking to quash. The petitioner is invoking the inherent powers of the court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to challenge this order.

The petitioner is seeking to quash the summoning order dated 7th August 2013 in Kalandra under Section 175 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in DD No.93, PS Anand Parbat. Additionally, the petitioner is seeking to set aside the order dated 6th May 2014 passed by the ASJ, Delhi. The impugned summoning order dated 7th August 2013 passed by the learned Trial Court in Kalandra under Section 175 IPC in DD No.93, PS Anand Parbat is to be recalled.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of the court to make orders necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. The petitioner is invoking this section to challenge the order of the ACMM, which the petitioner believes is unjust and an abuse of the process of the court.

The petitioner's main contention is that the ACMM's order is based on a misinterpretation of the law and facts of the case. The petitioner argues that the ACMM has failed to appreciate the evidence on record and has wrongly summoned the petitioner under Section 175 IPC. The petitioner contends that the ACMM's order is arbitrary, illegal, and without jurisdiction.

The petitioner further argues that the ASJ's order dated 6th May 2014 is also erroneous and should be set aside. The petitioner contends that the ASJ has failed to appreciate the evidence on record and has wrongly dismissed the petitioner's revision petition. The petitioner argues that the ASJ's order is arbitrary, illegal, and without jurisdiction.

The respondent, on the other hand, argues that the ACMM's order is based on a proper interpretation of the law and facts of the case. The respondent contends that the ACMM has correctly summoned the petitioner under Section 175 IPC based on the evidence on record. The respondent argues that the ACMM's order is legal, valid, and within jurisdiction.

The respondent further argues that the ASJ's order dated 6th May 2014 is also correct and should be upheld. The respondent contends that the ASJ has correctly dismissed the petitioner's revision petition based on the evidence on record. The respondent argues that the ASJ's order is legal, valid, and within jurisdiction.

The court, after hearing both parties, will have to decide whether the ACMM's order and the ASJ's order are legal, valid, and within jurisdiction. The court will have to consider the evidence on record and the arguments put forth by both parties before arriving at a decision.

In conclusion, the case at hand involves a dispute over a suit property between the complainant and the accused. The petitioner is challenging two orders passed by the ACMM and the ASJ in relation to this dispute. The petitioner is invoking the inherent powers of the court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. to challenge the ACMM's order. The court will have to consider the evidence on record and the arguments put forth by both parties before arriving at a decision.
