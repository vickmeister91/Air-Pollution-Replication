The court order pertains to the promotion of a member of the Central Armed Police Service to the rank of Inspector General of Central Reserve Police Force. The petitioner was empanelled for promotion, but his formal promotion order was withheld due to a medical examination report that found him medically unfit. The petitioner challenged his transfer orders and the withdrawal of his promotion order, alleging mala fide exercise of power and violation of constitutional guarantees and principles of natural justice. The respondents argued that the petitioner consistently failed to meet the medical fitness criteria for promotion and that the medical examination reports were valid.

The court found that the petitioner had been declared unfit for promotion in his medical examination conducted on 04.01.2012. The court referred to the guidelines for medical examination and classification of personnel in Central Para Military Forces and concluded that the petitioner was not eligible for promotion. The court ordered the withdrawal of the promotion order of the petitioner.

The court order also pertains to the procedure for Annual Medical Examination (AME) for combatised personnel in the Central Para Military Forces. The order outlines the guidelines for grading individuals based on their medical condition and the procedure for promotion based on medical category. The court also refers to a specific case where a petitioner's medical category was changed from P-3 to P-2 due to corrections made by doctors after the petitioner claimed to have made a wrong declaration. The court notes that the petitioner had exhausted his remedy of appeal against the medical report and that the matter was also pending in criminal proceedings. The court also highlights the importance of following the guidelines for medical categorization and promotion as prescribed in the Standing Order No. 04/2008.

The court order discusses the medical categorization of a CRPF officer, S.S. Sandhu, who was labeled as S1H1A1P1(O-24)E1 by the RML Hospital. The order explains that this categorization means that Sandhu has diabetes mellitus and must maintain certain parameters for a minimum of six months before being upgraded to P1. The order also discusses the legality of subjecting Sandhu's medical report to the parameters provided in the Standing Order No. 04/2008, which govern the medical examination of force personnel and determination of their medical category. The court ultimately concludes that the respondents did not commit any illegality in rectifying the wrong categorization of Sandhu and that the principles of natural justice were not violated.

The court order also pertains to the promotion of Shri S.S. Sandhu to the IG rank in the CRPF. Initially, he was promoted based on a medical examination report by Dr. RML Hospital, which categorized him as S1H1A1P1(O-24)E1. However, later on, it was found that comments of ADG (Medical), CAPFs & AR were not taken into account to assess his final SHAPE categorization. A medical board was constituted, which recommended his medical categorization as SHAP2E(Permanent). As SHAPE-1 is a mandatory condition for promotion in CRPF, and since Sandhu did not possess the same, his promotion order was revoked. The court dismissed Sandhu's petition challenging the revocation of his promotion order and ordered him to undergo a medical examination by the AIIMS Medical Board. If his medical category is determined as SHAPE-1, he shall be promoted as IG retrospectively from the date such promotion was earlier released in his favor with all consequential benefits.

In summary, the court order deals with the promotion of personnel in the Central Para Military Forces based on their medical fitness. The court emphasizes the importance of following the guidelines for medical categorization and promotion as prescribed in the Standing Order No. 04/2008. The court also highlights the need for transparency and fairness in the medical examination process and the importance of adhering to the principles of natural justice. The court order serves as a reminder to all concerned authorities to ensure that the promotion process is fair and transparent and that the guidelines for medical examination and categorization are followed strictly.
