The first court order pertains to a case where the petitioner is seeking the renewal of a license to operate a private slaughterhouse in Varanasi, which was closed by the U.P. Pollution Control Board due to non-compliance with environmental regulations. The petitioner alleges that the closure violates their fundamental right to carry on their business. However, the court finds that the right to carry on a trade or business is subject to reasonable restrictions, such as those related to environmental protection and animal welfare. The court notes that the Supreme Court is monitoring the issue of slaughterhouses and environmental laws, and directs the petitioner to comply with the regulations before reopening the slaughterhouse.

The court order highlights the importance of adhering to environmental laws and guidelines, especially in the case of private slaughterhouses. The court notes that private slaughterhouses are responsible for modernizing their facilities, but the Nagar Nigam (municipal corporation) has a duty to regulate and control all markets and slaughterhouses. The court denies the petitioner's request for a license renewal as there is no evidence of compliance with legal requirements. The petitioner is directed to file an appropriate application in the pending writ petition before the Supreme Court.

The court's decision is based on the fundamental principle that the right to carry on a trade or business is subject to reasonable restrictions. In this case, the closure of the slaughterhouse was due to non-compliance with environmental regulations, which are necessary to protect the environment and animal welfare. The court notes that the Supreme Court is monitoring the issue of slaughterhouses and environmental laws, which indicates the importance of adhering to these regulations.

The court also highlights the role of the Nagar Nigam in regulating and controlling all markets and slaughterhouses. Private slaughterhouses have a responsibility to modernize their facilities and comply with legal requirements, but it is the duty of the Nagar Nigam to ensure that these regulations are being followed. The court's decision to deny the petitioner's request for a license renewal is based on the lack of evidence of compliance with legal requirements.

The court directs the petitioner to file an appropriate application in the pending writ petition before the Supreme Court. This indicates that the issue of slaughterhouses and environmental laws is being closely monitored by the Supreme Court, and compliance with these regulations is necessary for the renewal of licenses. The court's decision emphasizes the importance of environmental protection and animal welfare in the operation of private slaughterhouses, and the need for strict adherence to legal requirements.
