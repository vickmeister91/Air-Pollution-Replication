The court order in question pertains to a case involving Raju Mogiya, who was convicted under Sections 51 read with Sec. 9 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and sentenced to three years of imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/-. Mogiya filed an application under Section 397(1) of Cr.P.C. for suspension of jail sentence, which was opposed by the Public Prosecutor. The court allowed the application and directed that the jail sentence of the applicant will remain under suspension on verification of the fact that whether the fine amount has been deposited or not, on the applicant's furnishing bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety. The applicant was directed to appear before the Principal Registrar of the Registry on 30/08/2019 and subsequent dates as may be fixed by the Registry from time to time till disposal of the revision.

The case against Mogiya was brought under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wildlife and their habitats, as well as to regulate hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Mogiya's conviction under the Act was based on evidence that he had hunted and killed a wild animal, which is a violation of the Act. The Act provides for strict penalties for such offenses, including imprisonment and fines. Mogiya was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/- for his offense.

However, Mogiya filed an application under Section 397(1) of Cr.P.C. for suspension of jail sentence, which was opposed by the Public Prosecutor. Section 397(1) of Cr.P.C. provides for the revision of orders passed by subordinate courts, and allows for the suspension of sentences pending the disposal of the revision. The court allowed Mogiya's application and directed that his jail sentence will remain under suspension on verification of the fact that whether the fine amount has been deposited or not, on the applicant's furnishing bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety.

The court's decision to suspend Mogiya's jail sentence was based on several factors. First, the court considered the fact that Mogiya had filed an application for revision of the order, which is a legal right available to him under the law. Second, the court considered the fact that Mogiya had furnished a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one solvent surety, which is a guarantee that he will appear before the court as and when required. Third, the court considered the fact that the fine amount had not yet been deposited, and directed that the suspension of the jail sentence will remain subject to verification of the fact that the fine amount has been deposited.

The court also directed Mogiya to appear before the Principal Registrar of the Registry on 30/08/2019 and subsequent dates as may be fixed by the Registry from time to time till disposal of the revision. This is a standard procedure in cases where a revision has been filed, and is intended to ensure that the case is heard and disposed of in a timely manner.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case involving Raju Mogiya, who was convicted under Sections 51 read with Sec. 9 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and sentenced to three years of imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/-.
