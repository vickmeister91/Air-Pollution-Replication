The case in question involves the sale and development of forest land, which was later demolished by authorities. The applicant claims to have purchased the property from the co-accused and had no knowledge that the land was forest land. The charges against the accused include offenses under the Indian Penal Code, Environment Act, Indian Forest Act, and Maharashtra Land Revenue Code.

The court granted interim protection to the applicant, which means that the applicant will not be arrested until the next hearing. However, the court has directed the applicant to report to the investigating officer, hand over relevant documents, and cooperate with the investigation. This indicates that the court is taking the case seriously and expects the applicant to assist in the investigation.

The court's decision to grant interim protection to the applicant is based on the fact that the applicant claims to have purchased the property from the co-accused and had no knowledge that the land was forest land. This suggests that the court is willing to consider the applicant's defense and is not immediately assuming guilt.

The case has been adjourned to September 24, 2018, which means that the court will hear the case again on that date. This indicates that the court is taking its time to carefully consider the evidence and make a fair decision.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following environmental laws and regulations, particularly when it comes to the sale and development of forest land. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to be aware of the laws and regulations that apply to their actions, as ignorance is not a defense in the eyes of the law.
