Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a different case in Devakottai, Tamil Nadu. The first case involves a writ petition filed by M. Ingaci against the Devakottai Municipality, challenging an order to close down his cement shop. The petitioner had previously faced legal action from the fifth respondent, who had filed a public interest litigation against him for causing air pollution. The court dismissed the writ petition and warned the petitioner against filing frivolous petitions. The petitioner then filed a suit for damages against the fifth respondent and subsequently faced legal action from the Municipality. The court dismissed the petitioner's objections to the order to close down his shop, stating that he had not complied with previous notices and that the order was not influenced by the fifth respondent.

In the second case, a petitioner challenged a notice from the Municipal Commissioner regarding alterations to their shop. The petitioner was defiant and refused to make any alterations, leading to an inspection by the Pollution Control Board. The report from the District Environmental Engineer was found to be more credible than that of an Advocate Commissioner, and the court applied the precautionary principle in matters relating to pollution. The petitioner had not obtained a license under the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, 1920, and the court found no merit in their argument that the impugned order offended their fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). The writ petition was dismissed.

The third court order states that the petitioner's fundamental right is subject to the fundamental rights of the public, and restrictions imposed for public health and environmental protection cannot be easily interfered with. The writ petition is dismissed with no order for costs, and connected miscellaneous petition is also dismissed. The order is addressed to the Commissioner of Devakottai Municipality, Revenue Divisional Officer of Devakottai, District Pollution Control Welfare Engineer of Madurai, and Deputy Director of Health Services of Sivagangai District.

In all three cases, the court prioritized public health and environmental protection over the individual rights of the petitioners. The court also emphasized the importance of complying with previous notices and regulations. The dismissal of the writ petitions serves as a warning to individuals and businesses to take necessary measures to prevent pollution and comply with regulations.
