In the first court order, the case was filed by Swatantra Bharat Mills and DCM Silk Mills against the Delhi Development Authority. The issue at hand was whether the mills were entitled to retain and develop 2000 square meters each of land while surrendering the remaining land to the community, as per the Supreme Court's orders in the M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India case. The court examined the background of the case and the Supreme Court's directions regarding the relocation of hazardous industries from Delhi and the surrender of land by their owners for community use. The court ultimately dismissed the mills' petition and upheld the executing court's order.

The second court order directed the closure of industrial units in Delhi with effect from 30-11-1996 and the assistance of the National Capital Region Planning Board in relocating the industries. The order also required the four states in the NCR to set up a unified agency to facilitate the shifting of industries and the use of land made available by the relocation. The order provided for the rights and benefits of the workmen employed in the industries, including continuity of employment and compensation. The order also required the surrender of excess land to the Delhi Development Authority and the execution of the order by the District Judge. The review petition against the order was eventually dismissed.

The third court order discussed a review petition that was dismissed by the District Judge in 2010. The petition questioned the correctness of the order and focused on two issues related to surrendering land. The first issue concerned whether two separate units were entitled to the benefit of 2000 sq. mtrs of land each, while the second issue concerned whether surrender was required only from industrial land and not from residential complexes. The court found no error in the approach of the trial court and dismissed the petition. The court also clarified that the right of retention of land and the obligation to surrender the remaining land were not of the industry but of the owner of the industry.
