In a case involving the death of Ghulam Mohd due to electrocution caused by a high tension electric wire installed by the Rural Electric Maintenance Division, the widow and minor children of the deceased filed a suit for damages seeking Rs. 21,75,218/-, claiming negligence on the part of the Electric Department. The court found the compensation granted to be reasonable and held that the grant of pensionary benefits to the widow would not disentitle her to claim compensation from the State. The court also established that the State has an absolute liability to maintain electric installations in a manner that they are not accessible to the general public and are not able to cause injury to a person.

The court order states that it is the duty of the state and its agencies to ensure the safety of the public from harm or injury caused by non-maintenance and improper electric installations. If the state fails to perform this duty, they can be held responsible for any damages or injuries caused. The court upholds the compensation awarded by the trial court and dismisses the appeal.

The case highlights the importance of ensuring the safety of the public from harm or injury caused by non-maintenance and improper electric installations. The court has established that the State has an absolute liability to maintain electric installations in a manner that they are not accessible to the general public and are not able to cause injury to a person. This means that the State cannot escape liability for damages or injuries caused due to its failure to maintain electric installations properly.

The court has also held that the grant of pensionary benefits to the widow would not disentitle her to claim compensation from the State.

The court has also dismissed the appeal, which means that the compensation awarded by the trial court has been upheld.
