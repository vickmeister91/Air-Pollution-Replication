The court order in question pertains to an appeal made by a co-debtor in a suit under the Encumbered Estates Act proceedings. The case involves a claim for arrears of rent by a superior proprietor against an under-proprietor and his co-sharers. The appellant, who became a co-sharer after the years in question, argued that the claim was barred by time and that a Receiver appointed over the property had already realized rents from tenants and other profits.

The court held that the burden of proving payment was on the claimant and that the claim was not barred by time. However, the court also found that the claimant had not proven the amount due after realizations had been made by the Receiver and that the claim was only valid for one year instead of two. The court allowed the appeal in part and modified the decree passed by the lower court.

To understand the court order in more detail, it is important to understand the background of the case. The case involves a dispute between a superior proprietor and an under-proprietor and his co-sharers over arrears of rent. The superior proprietor claimed that the under-proprietor and his co-sharers had not paid rent for two years, and therefore, owed him a significant amount of money.

The under-proprietor and his co-sharers, including the appellant, argued that the claim was barred by time and that a Receiver appointed over the property had already realized rents from tenants and other profits. The Receiver was appointed by the court to manage the property and collect rents from tenants on behalf of the parties involved in the dispute.

The court held that the burden of proving payment was on the claimant, in this case, the superior proprietor. The court found that the claim was not barred by time, as the under-proprietor and his co-sharers had not provided sufficient evidence to prove that they had paid the rent in question. However, the court also found that the claimant had not proven the amount due after realizations had been made by the Receiver.

The court noted that the Receiver had collected rents from tenants and other profits from the property. The court found that the claim was only valid for one year instead of two, as the Receiver had already collected rent for one year. Therefore, the claimant was only entitled to the rent for one year, and not two.

The court allowed the appeal in part and modified the decree passed by the lower court. The court found that the claimant was entitled to the rent for one year, but not for two years as claimed. The court also found that the claimant had not proven the amount due after realizations had been made by the Receiver.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a co-debtor's appeal in a suit under the Encumbered Estates Act proceedings. The case involves a claim for arrears of rent by a superior proprietor against an under-proprietor and his co-sharers. The court held that the burden of proving payment was on the claimant and that the claim was not barred by time. However, the court also found that the claimant had not proven the amount due after realizations had been made by the Receiver and that the claim was only valid for one year instead of two. The court allowed the appeal in part and modified the decree passed by the lower court.
