The court order pertains to a case involving Talaulicar & Sons P. Ltd. and their expansion of the Saniem Sacorda Iron Ore Mine. The company had been granted environmental clearance for two years, which expired on November 25, 2010. Despite this, the company continued mining operations, leading to a petition by a local resident for a mandamus to stop the operation of the mine and payment of compensation for environmental damage. The Division Bench of the High Court held that the company was carrying on mining operations without a valid subsisting environmental clearance and directed them to discontinue mining operations of the concerned mine until such time environmental clearance is granted. The company appealed against this judgment, and the court heard arguments from all parties and examined the relevant provisions of the Environment Protection Act and the EIA Notifications.

The court order directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to take a fresh look at the continuation or otherwise of the environmental clearance granted by it in the order dated November 25, 2005. The MoEF is directed to scrupulously follow the various relevant factors, such as notifying the State level Authority and other Authorities concerned, effective public hearing after due paper publication, and referring to the hydro geological report submitted by the appellant. The MoEF is then to pass final orders. The order dated October 18, 2007, is set aside, and the impugned order cannot stand. The court also directs the MoEF to proceed afresh, issue a notice of hearing to the appellant, the second respondent, as well as hold the consultative process with the State Level Authorities and call for the required reports from the concerned experts of its choice. After due hearing, the MoEF is to pass appropriate orders, in accordance with the law.
