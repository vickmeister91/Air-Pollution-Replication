The case of Hansram involved a bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. in relation to an FIR registered at Police Station Sarmathura, District Dholpur for offences under Section 379 of I.P.C., Section 29, 51 of Wild Protection Act and Section 30, 31, 32, 41 & 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act. The petitioner was not the owner or driver of the tractor involved in the transportation of bajri and was arrested more than five months after the alleged incident. 

The court allowed the bail application and directed the accused petitioner to furnish a personal bond and sureties to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This decision was made after considering the facts of the case and the arguments presented by both parties. The court found that the petitioner was not directly involved in the alleged crime and that there was no evidence to suggest that he was a flight risk or a danger to society.

The court also took into account the length of time that the petitioner had already spent in custody and the fact that he had no prior criminal record. The court recognized that the right to bail is a fundamental right and that it should only be denied in exceptional circumstances. In this case, the court found that there were no exceptional circumstances that would justify denying bail to the petitioner.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Hansram was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the principles of justice. The court recognized the importance of protecting society from criminal activity, but also recognized the importance of protecting the rights of the accused. By granting bail to the petitioner, the court ensured that justice was served in a fair and equitable manner.
