The case of Shravan Singh v. Board of Revenue concerned an appeal against the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge who had dismissed the appellant's petition. The appellant claimed that he was in possession of forest land and that the Board of Revenue had made an error in setting aside the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority. The court found that the learned Single Judge's decision was correct and dismissed the appeal.

The appellant, Shravan Singh, had filed a petition before the learned Single Judge, challenging the order of the Board of Revenue, which had set aside the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority. The Revenue Appellate Authority had allowed the appellant's appeal and had directed the Board of Revenue to restore the possession of the forest land to the appellant. The Board of Revenue had set aside this order on the ground that the appellant had failed to prove his possession of the forest land.

The appellant contended that he was in possession of the forest land and that the Board of Revenue had made an error in setting aside the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority. He argued that the Board of Revenue had not considered the evidence produced by him and had relied on the report of the Forest Department, which was not admissible in evidence.

The learned Single Judge dismissed the appellant's petition, holding that the Board of Revenue had rightly set aside the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority. The learned Single Judge observed that the appellant had failed to prove his possession of the forest land and that the report of the Forest Department was admissible in evidence.

The appellant appealed against the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge. The appellant contended that the learned Single Judge had erred in holding that the report of the Forest Department was admissible in evidence. He argued that the report was hearsay and could not be relied upon.

The court considered the submissions made by the appellant and found that the learned Single Judge's decision was correct. The court observed that the report of the Forest Department was admissible in evidence under Section 35 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The court held that the report was a public document and could be proved by a certified copy. The court further held that the appellant had failed to prove his possession of the forest land and that the Board of Revenue had rightly set aside the order of the Revenue Appellate Authority.

In conclusion, the case of Shravan Singh v. Board of Revenue concerned an appeal against the judgment and order of a learned Single Judge who had dismissed the appellant's petition. The court found that the learned Single Judge's decision was correct and dismissed the appeal.
