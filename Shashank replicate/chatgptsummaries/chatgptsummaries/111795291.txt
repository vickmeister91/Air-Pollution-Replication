The court order in question relates to a bail application filed under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) in connection with a forest crime case registered at the Forest Department police station in Morena district. The case pertains to an alleged violation of sections 09 and 15 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

During the hearing, the applicant's counsel chose to withdraw the bail application, resulting in its dismissal as withdrawn. This means that the applicant will remain in custody until further legal proceedings take place.

Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the High Court or Court of Session to grant bail in non-bailable offences. In such cases, the court may grant bail to the accused person if it deems fit, subject to certain conditions. However, the decision to grant bail ultimately rests with the court, and it may choose to deny bail if it believes that the accused person is likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

In this particular case, the applicant had sought bail in relation to a forest crime case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. This Act is aimed at protecting wild animals and plants, and prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Violations of the Act can result in imprisonment and fines.

The fact that the applicant's counsel chose to withdraw the bail application suggests that they may have felt that the chances of obtaining bail were slim. It is also possible that the applicant may have decided to pursue other legal options instead of seeking bail at this stage.

Overall, the court order in question is a brief and straightforward one, indicating that the bail application was withdrawn and dismissed as a result. It provides little information about the specifics of the case or the reasons behind the decision to withdraw the application. However, it does highlight the importance of complying with wildlife protection laws and the potential consequences of violating them.
