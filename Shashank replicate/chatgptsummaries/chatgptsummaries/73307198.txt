The Indian court has issued several orders related to the sale and registration of motor vehicles in the country. The first court order discusses whether Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) compliant vehicles should be allowed to be sold in India after March 31, 2020. The court had previously directed that non-BS-IV compliant vehicles should not be sold after April 1, 2017, and prohibited their registration after that date, except for those sold on or before March 31, 2017. The manufacturers of motor vehicles have requested reasonable time to sell their non-BS-VI compliant vehicles manufactured up to March 31, 2020, and the government has given them a three-month window to dispose of these vehicles. The court is considering whether to grant more time to the manufacturers.

The second court order discusses the shift from BS-IV fuel to BS-VI fuel in India and the difficulties faced by manufacturers. The court notes the importance of a cleaner environment and the health hazards of pollution. The Union Government has spent a significant amount of money to manufacture BS-IV and BS-VI compliant fuel. The court urges manufacturers to comply with the March 31, 2020 deadline for BS-VI compliant vehicles and highlights that some manufacturers are not willing to comply due to the potential increase in vehicle cost. The court emphasizes the importance of health over profit and notes the significant improvement in environmental terms with the enforcement of BS-VI emission norms. The amicus curiae urges the application of BS-VI norms for the sale of vehicles in the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi from April 1, 2020.

The third court order states that the sale of BS-VI compliant vehicles should be applied throughout the country, not just in the NCR of Delhi. The court emphasizes the importance of a clean environment and the right to live in a healthy atmosphere. The court also notes that the sale of non-BS-VI compliant vehicles after April 1, 2020, will cause more pollution and harm the health of citizens. The court urges manufacturers to switch to the new system and not delay the introduction of BS-VI compliant vehicles.

The fourth court order directs that no motor vehicle conforming to the emission standard Bharat Stage-IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country with effect from April 1, 2020. The government has developed a policy of phasing out polluting vehicles and discouraging the manufacturers of polluting vehicles. The automobile industry must show the will, responsibility, and urgency to manufacture BS-VI compliant vehicles as soon as possible. The need of the hour is to move to a cleaner fuel as early as possible. The court exercised its power under Article 142 of the Constitution to read down sub-rule 21 of Rule 115.
