The order had to be passed within three weeks from the date of production of the judgment.

The petitioner, Karapara Estate A Padagiri, had applied for permission to do shade regulation in their coffee estate. However, their application was rejected by the Divisional Forest Officer on the grounds of lease violation. The petitioner then filed a writ petition in court, seeking permission to proceed with shade regulation in their coffee estate.

The court considered the arguments made by both parties and directed the first respondent, the Divisional Forest Officer, to permit the petitioner to proceed with shade regulation in their coffee estate. However, the court also made it clear that this permission was without prejudice to the right of the respondents to proceed against the petitioner for any violation of the Forest Conservation Act or any of the lease conditions.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the arguments made by both parties. The petitioner argued that they had not violated any lease conditions and that shade regulation was necessary for the proper growth of coffee plants. The Divisional Forest Officer, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner had violated the lease conditions and that shade regulation would harm the forest ecosystem.

The court found that the petitioner had not violated any lease conditions and that shade regulation was necessary for the proper growth of coffee plants. The court also found that the Divisional Forest Officer had not provided any evidence to support their claim that shade regulation would harm the forest ecosystem.

The court's decision was a balanced one, which took into account the interests of both parties. The court directed the first respondent to permit the petitioner to proceed with shade regulation in their coffee estate, but also made it clear that this permission was without prejudice to the right of the respondents to proceed against the petitioner for any violation of the Forest Conservation Act or any of the lease conditions.

The court's order was to be passed within three weeks from the date of production of the judgment. This meant that the Divisional Forest Officer had to comply with the court's decision within three weeks, failing which they would be in contempt of court.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by Karapara Estate A Padagiri against the Divisional Forest Officer was a balanced one, which took into account the interests of both parties. The court directed the first respondent to permit the petitioner to proceed with shade regulation in their coffee estate, but also made it clear that this permission was without prejudice to the right of the respondents to proceed against the petitioner for any violation of the Forest Conservation Act or any of the lease conditions. The order had to be passed within three weeks from the date of production of the judgment.
