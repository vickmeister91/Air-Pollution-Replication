The court order pertains to an appeal filed by Sh. Lakshman Singhal against an order passed by the Ld. Additional Senior Civil Judge, Central District, Tis Hazari, dismissing his application under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2, CPC. The plaintiff had sought to restrain the defendants from raising any further construction in shops and to direct the North Municipal Corporation of Delhi to demolish the unauthorized construction over the suit property. The defendants had denied the allegations of encroachment and sought dismissal of the suit. The court heard the arguments and reserved the judgment.

In its ruling, the court found that the owner/occupier of a property had made unauthorized construction by removing a wall and constructing a loft without permission. A show cause notice has been issued, and further action will be taken after following the due process of law. The plaintiff's temporary injunction application was turned down as he does not reside adjacent to the suit property, and there was no averment that his property suffered any damage or infringement of his personal rights. However, the court disagreed with the trial court's observations and held that the plaintiff's easementary right to access the alleged encroached road would be affected. The alleged encroachment affects the environment, and it is the duty of one and all to maintain a hygienic environment.

The court order emphasizes that it is the duty of everyone to maintain a hygienic environment and expose encroachers. The trial court's rejection of the plaintiff's application cannot be sustained as it did not provide any reason for it. The court has asked for a report from the defendant on the alleged encroachments and has suggested that the defendant's wife should have been joined in the proceedings. The plaintiff has to pay court fees for the relief claimed for mental agony/harassment. The matter has been remanded to the trial court for a decision afresh on the plaintiff's application.

In summary, the court order deals with a case of unauthorized construction and encroachment on a property. The plaintiff had sought a temporary injunction to restrain the defendants from raising any further construction in shops and to direct the North Municipal Corporation of Delhi to demolish the unauthorized construction over the suit property. The court found that the owner/occupier of the property had made unauthorized construction by removing a wall and constructing a loft without permission. The plaintiff's temporary injunction application was turned down, but the court held that the plaintiff's easementary right to access the alleged encroached road would be affected. The court emphasized the duty of everyone to maintain a hygienic environment and expose encroachers. The matter has been remanded to the trial court for a decision afresh on the plaintiff's application.
