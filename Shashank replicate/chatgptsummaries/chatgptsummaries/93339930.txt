The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Hemraj Nama against M/S Goyal General Store. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07. However, the Appellate Court dismissed the application, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order. The court held that no revision lies against an interlocutory order, and therefore, dismissed the revision petition.

The case at hand involves a dispute between Hemraj Nama and M/S Goyal General Store. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 CR.P.C. for summoning the ledger books of the respondent firm of financial year 2005-06 and 2006-07. However, the Appellate Court dismissed the application, and the petitioner filed a revision petition against the order.

The petitioner's argument was that the ledger books were necessary to establish the financial transactions of the respondent firm during the relevant period. The petitioner claimed that the respondent firm had committed financial irregularities during the relevant period, and the ledger books would provide evidence of the same.

However, the court held that the petitioner's revision petition was not maintainable. The court observed that the order passed by the Appellate Court was an interlocutory order, and no revision lies against an interlocutory order. The court cited several precedents to support its conclusion.

The court noted that the purpose of Section 91 CR.P.C. is to enable the court to compel the production of any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court also noted that the power to summon documents under Section 91 CR.P.C. is not absolute, and the court must exercise its discretion judiciously.

The court observed that the Appellate Court had exercised its discretion in dismissing the petitioner's application for summoning the ledger books. The court noted that the Appellate Court had considered the petitioner's arguments and had found them to be without merit. The court held that the Appellate Court's order was a reasoned order, and there was no error apparent on the face of the record.

The court also noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him. The petitioner could have challenged the Appellate Court's order by way of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. However, the petitioner had not availed of this remedy.

In conclusion, the court held that the petitioner's revision petition was not maintainable, and therefore, dismissed the same. The court observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him, but he had not availed of the same. The court also noted that the power to summon documents under Section 91 CR.P.C. is not absolute, and the court must exercise its discretion judiciously. The court held that the Appellate Court had exercised its discretion in dismissing the petitioner's application for summoning the ledger books, and there was no error apparent on the face of the record.
