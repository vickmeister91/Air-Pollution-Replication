In a recent court order, two individuals were charged under the Wild Life (Protection) Act after two pea-fowls were seized from their shop in Delhi. The defense counsel argued that their clients were falsely implicated, but the court held that there was sufficient evidence to frame charges against them under sections 44 and 49(b)(1) of the Act. 

The court clarified that at the stage of framing charges, the probative value of the evidence cannot be gone into, and the court has to only see whether a prima facie case is made out against the accused. This means that the court is only concerned with whether there is enough evidence to suggest that the accused may have committed the crime, and not whether they are actually guilty. 

The court also ordered that the charge under section 51 of the Act be framed separately. Section 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act pertains to the penalty for contravention of any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder. This suggests that the accused may face additional penalties if they are found guilty of violating this section of the Act. 

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following wildlife protection laws and the consequences of violating them. The court's decision to frame charges against the accused suggests that they may have a case to answer for, and it will be up to the court to determine their guilt or innocence.
