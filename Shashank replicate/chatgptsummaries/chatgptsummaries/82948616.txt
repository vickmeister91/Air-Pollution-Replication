The court has issued a ruling on multiple writ petitions filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The petitioners, who are residents of Lalithadripura Village, Varuna Hobli, Mysore Taluk and District, are seeking to quash preliminary and final notifications issued under the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987. The respondents include the Special Land Acquisition Officer, Mysore Urban Development Authority, and the State of Karnataka. The court has not yet made a ruling on the petitions.

In another case, three writ petitions were filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, seeking to quash the preliminary and final notifications issued under the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987 for the acquisition of agricultural land in Lalithadripura village, Varuna hobli, Mysore Taluk and District. The petitioners claimed that the acquisition proceedings were flawed due to various reasons, including the failure to take physical possession of the land and the failure to implement the scheme within five years. The respondent authority argued that the acquisition was carried out with due diligence and that the petitioners' claims were not tenable. The court has reserved its order on the matter.

The court order also addressed a project that required environmental clearance from the competent authority before any construction work could be undertaken. The government had approved the proposal for the project, and the tendering process had been completed. The respondents had filed progress reports on the implementation of the work. The main dispute was whether the respondents had substantially implemented the scheme of formation of the layout. The court found that there was abundant material available on record to demonstrate the substantial implementation of the scheme by the respondents. The petitioners failed on all grounds urged, and the court accepted the stand of the respondents.

In summary, the court has issued a ruling on multiple writ petitions filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India. The court has not yet made a ruling on the petitions seeking to quash preliminary and final notifications issued under the Karnataka Urban Development Authorities Act, 1987.
