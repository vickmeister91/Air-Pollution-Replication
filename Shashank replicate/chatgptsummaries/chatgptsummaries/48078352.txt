The Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area in the Indian state of Jharkhand. In 2016, a writ petition was filed by Basant Narayan Mehta regarding the finalization of a notification on the declaration of an Eco-Sensitive Zone in and around the sanctuary. The Union of India submitted that a draft notification had been published and the petitioner could approach the authorities specified in the draft notification with the same set of grievances.

The court order pertains to this writ petition and the subsequent proceedings. The court has given liberty to the petitioner to participate in the proceeding arising from the draft notification and take appropriate steps as permissible under the law if aggrieved with the ultimate outcome. The writ petition has been disposed of with no order as to costs.

The Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including tigers, leopards, elephants, and several species of birds. The sanctuary is spread over an area of 184 square kilometers and is an important ecological hotspot in the region. The declaration of an Eco-Sensitive Zone around the sanctuary is aimed at protecting the fragile ecosystem and preventing any activities that could harm the wildlife and their habitat.

The writ petition filed by Basant Narayan Mehta sought to expedite the finalization of the notification on the declaration of the Eco-Sensitive Zone. The petitioner argued that the delay in finalizing the notification was causing irreparable damage to the environment and the wildlife in the area. The Union of India submitted that a draft notification had been published and the petitioner could approach the authorities specified in the draft notification with the same set of grievances.

The court, after hearing both sides, disposed of the writ petition with no order as to costs. The court gave liberty to the petitioner to participate in the proceeding arising from the draft notification and take appropriate steps as permissible under the law if aggrieved with the ultimate outcome. This means that the petitioner can approach the authorities specified in the draft notification and raise any concerns or objections they may have regarding the declaration of the Eco-Sensitive Zone.

The court order is significant as it upholds the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife in the region. The declaration of an Eco-Sensitive Zone around the Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary is a crucial step in ensuring the long-term survival of the flora and fauna in the area. The court's decision to give liberty to the petitioner to participate in the proceeding arising from the draft notification is also a positive step as it allows for greater public participation and transparency in the decision-making process.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Basant Narayan Mehta regarding the finalization of a notification on the declaration of an Eco-Sensitive Zone in and around the Hazaribagh Wildlife Sanctuary. The court has given liberty to the petitioner to participate in the proceeding arising from the draft notification and take appropriate steps as permissible under the law if aggrieved with the ultimate outcome. The writ petition has been disposed of with no order as to costs.
