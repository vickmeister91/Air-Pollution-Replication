The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various aspects of a limestone mining project in Meghalaya, India, initiated by Lafarge Umiam Mining Pvt. Ltd. The project involved a cross-border cement manufacturing project in Bangladesh that had a captive limestone mine in Meghalaya. The National Forest Policy of 1988 is cited in the order, which emphasizes the need for forest conservation and protection, sustainable utilization, and ecological balance. The order also highlights the importance of involving local communities in forest management and protecting their rights. 

One of the court orders discusses the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification issued by the Central Government in 1994, which requires environmental clearance for any new project or expansion listed in Schedule-I. The order also mentions the case of LMMPL, which applied for environmental clearance for a limestone mining project in Meghalaya in 1997 and was asked to seek Site Clearance and Project Clearance separately. The application for site clearance was allowed in 1999 subject to compliance with terms and conditions, including obtaining environmental clearance before starting any developmental work. LMMPL applied for environmental clearance in 2000 to excavate 2.0 million tonnes per annum of limestone and transport it to Bangladesh.

Another court order describes the process of obtaining environmental clearance for a limestone mining project in Nongtrai, Meghalaya. The project proponent submitted an application with various NOCs and certificates from competent authorities, including a certificate from the local DFO stating that the mining site was not a forest area. Despite this, the MoEF raised queries and sought additional information, which the project proponent provided. The matter was examined by an Expert Committee, and ultimately, the court found that the project had followed due process and granted environmental clearance. The order includes details about the topography of the mining site and the environmental implications of the project.

The court also discussed the process of obtaining forest clearance under the 1980 Act for mining activities. The mining plan for the project area describes it as having Karst topography with deep caverns, caves, and cracks. The land is rocky with very little soil and mixed deciduous vegetation. The court clarifies that the obligation to submit a proposal for forest diversion under the 1980 Act is exclusively the obligation of the State Government. The court also notes that there was a change of view on the part of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) almost after nine years, and the project proponent should be directed to obtain clearance under the 1980 Act before expanding mining activities.

The court found that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) had applied due diligence in granting Stage-I forest clearance and revised environmental clearance to M/s. Lafarge for mining in Meghalaya. Despite compliances by the project proponent and issuance of certificates by various authorities, MoEF sought further clarifications and information by raising necessary requisitions. The court also imposed additional conditions on M/s. Lafarge in addition to those laid down by MoEF. These conditions were in terms of the court's judgment in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India with regard to commercial exploitability.

The court order mandates that a Nationalized Bank account be opened for the welfare projects in the project area of 50 kms for the local community and welfare of Tribals. The User Agency must comply with all conditions imposed on it earlier and further recommendations made by the Committee constituted by the MoEF. The MoEF shall take a final decision under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 for the revised environmental clearance for diversion of 116 hectares of forest land. The court should review the decision-making process to ensure that the decision of MoEF is fair and fully informed, based on the correct principles, and free from any bias or restraint.

The court order upholds the decision of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to grant site clearance, EIA clearance, revised environmental clearance, and Stage-I forest clearance to Lafarge. The court also allows Lafarge's application and dismisses SAC's application. The court declares that the National Forest Policy, 1988, should govern the grant of permissions under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and should be read as part of the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court directs the Central Government to appoint a National Regulator for appraising projects, enforcing environmental conditions for approvals, and imposing penalties on polluters. 

The court order outlines guidelines for the scrutiny and appraisal of proposals involving the diversion of forest area and mining. It also calls for the creation of a GIS-based decision support database and the uploading of all forest clearances on the Ministry's website for public accountability. The order also mandates the completion of an exercise to identify areas that are "forests" and the preparation of district forest maps. The order provides guidelines for the grant of forest clearances and identification of forests and requires a comprehensive policy for inspection, verification, and monitoring. These guidelines are to be implemented in all future cases until a regulatory mechanism is put in place. The Ministry of Environment and Forests will file a compliance report within six months.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the importance of environmental conservation and protection, sustainable utilization, and ecological balance. The court emphasizes the need for involving local communities in forest management and protecting their rights. The court also provides guidelines for the scrutiny and appraisal
