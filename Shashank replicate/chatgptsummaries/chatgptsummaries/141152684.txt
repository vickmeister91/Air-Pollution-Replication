The court order pertains to a dispute over property ownership in Koheda village, Ranga Reddy district. The case involves five revisions against the orders of the Joint Collector, with the core issue being a claim over who are the Protected Tenants (PTs) of the property. The revisions were filed by six petitioners, who are sons of Yellaiah, the original PT for the land. The court also mentions the impleadment of unofficial respondents who claim to have purchased some of the plots in question and are seeking to protect their interests. The order lists the plot numbers and documents of the implead petitioners.

The court order lists various plots of land with their respective sizes and registration details. It also mentions the agreement of sale cum GPA with possession deed numbers and dates for each plot. Several petitioners are also mentioned as being impleaded in the case.

The court order discusses implead petitions filed by several parties in relation to plots of land and registered sale deeds. The revision petitioners opposed the implead petitions, claiming they were unnecessary parties. The court ultimately allowed all the implead petitions. The revision grounds in several cases were that the Joint Collector's order was contrary to the law and facts of the case. The court also discusses the counter-arguments made by the respondents. Overall, the court order deals with disputes over land ownership and the validity of certain certificates and records.

The court order from 03.02.1984 granted 38-E certificates to villagers of Koheda village after correcting tenancy records and conducting a local enquiry. The Tahsildar prepared a corrected tenancy register based on physical possession, which was accepted by those in actual possession. The register showed protected tenants in possession of specific survey numbers and extents of land. The names of those not in physical possession were deleted from the records. The petitioners did not raise any objections and later executed a GPA after receiving corrected 38E certificates.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the correction of a protected tenancy list and the granting of a 38E certificate. The petitioners had previously accepted the corrections and sold the corrected survey numbers to third parties. The court found that the petitioners cannot claim the wrong survey numbers and that the provisions of the AP (Telangana area) Tenancy Act are not applicable to non-agricultural lands. The court also found that the petitioners had full knowledge of the proceedings and had no locus standi to question them. The court dismissed the revisions and suspended the operation of previous orders.

The court order states that the petitioners are the legal successors of the PT and any alleged correction or alteration without putting them on notice is illegal and without any authority of law and in violation of provisions of the Act and principles of natural justice. The court also mentions that the alleged enquiry and correction of records did not take place and assuming the same was conducted, it was done without issuing any notice whatsoever to the PT or his legal heirs. The court allows the revisions and remands the matter to the Joint Collector for fresh consideration according to law after setting aside the order.

The court order pertains to a dispute over protected tenancy rights for certain lands. The court found that the original protected tenants, Kandada Yellaiah and Thatichettu Devaiah, were entitled to the lands in question and that the unofficial respondents had no right to claim them as legal heirs or bona fide purchasers. The court also noted that unless a protected tenancy is terminated in accordance with the law, it continues to subsist. The court set aside the 38-E certificate issued in favor of the unofficial respondents and directed the Joint Collector, RDO, and MRO to grant the Section 38-E certificates to the petitioners and mutate their names in the revenue records. The court considered several relevant principles and propositions in reaching its decision.
