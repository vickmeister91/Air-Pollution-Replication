The court has been hearing submissions from both parties regarding a petition seeking relief from restraints imposed by a previous court order. The previous order, issued in 2016, required compliance with the Municipal Solid Waste Rules and directed local authorities to acquire designated sites for waste disposal. The current petition seeks to vacate the restraints imposed by the previous order. The court provided a brief summary of the previous order and relevant clauses.

The court order requires local authorities to take action against encroachment on designated sites within two weeks, and any legal proceedings related to eviction must be filed only in court. Local authorities with inadequate facilities must assess the need for additional sites and follow directions for selection and acquisition. Dumping sites that do not comply with MSW Rules must be closed within three months, and waste processing facilities must be established in accordance with MSW Rules. The State Government must make decisions on pending proposals within 45 days. Sites for composting and vermi composting must comply with MSW Rules and MPCB regulations.

The court order states that if there is non-compliance with the MSW Rules and parameters regarding the storage and operation of composting or vermi compost plant, the facility will be closed down until remedial measures are taken and compliance is reported by the MPCB. The order also includes an action plan for the treatment and processing of solid waste, with specific time schedules for each step. The court notes that the Corporation did not comply with previous orders and repeatedly received extensions of time. A civil application was filed for seeking an extension of time to comply with the order. The affidavit filed by the Corporation notes the daily generation of municipal solid waste and construction waste in the City of Mumbai.

The court order states that the daily generation of municipal solid waste in Mumbai is around 9,400 MT, but the only proper processing facility in the city has a capacity of only 3,000 MT per day, resulting in 6,400 MT of waste being dumped illegally. The Municipal Corporation has given assurances to address the issue, including the allotment of additional sites for waste processing. However, as of the order, no solution has been implemented to prevent the increase in waste generation. The court notes that similar issues have been addressed in other municipalities, and restrictions on development permissions have been imposed until facilities are created in compliance with MSW Rules. The court warns that if the Municipal Corporation does not abide by its assurances, drastic orders may be passed.

The court order states that the Municipal Corporation has failed to comply with the MSW Rules and the court's previous order, leading to pollution and violation of citizens' fundamental rights. The recent incidents of fire at the Deonar dumping ground have caused disastrous effects on the people living nearby, increasing pollution levels and causing respiratory diseases. The CCTV cameras at the site are not working, and there is no police protection, leading to breaches in the compound wall. The court suggests penal action against those responsible for the violations.

The court order states that 7,400 MT of solid waste is being illegally dumped in Mumbai every day. The court granted an extension of time until June 30, 2017, for the Mumbai Municipal Corporation to comply with the directions to establish facilities for processing municipal solid waste of at least 11,000 MT per day. The order imposes restrictions on the grant of proposals for new construction of buildings for residential or commercial purposes, except for certain redevelopment projects, hospitals, and educational institutions. The State Government and/or the Municipal Corporation must undertake a scientific assessment of the impact of constructions likely to come up in the city in the next ten years on the generation of municipal solid waste.

The court order requires the State Government and/or the Municipal Corporation to conduct a scientific assessment of the impact of new construction projects on the generation of municipal solid waste, including construction waste, for at least 10 years. The order also prohibits the extension of additional FSI to building proposals and development permissions, even if there is an amendment of the DCR. The Development Control Regulations must be amended to incorporate the suggestions in the additional affidavit of Shri Swadheen Kshatriya dated 15th February 2016. The court also issued comprehensive directions for monitoring and maintenance of the site at Deonar. The Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry filed a review petition, arguing that the Construction & Demolition and De-silting Waste (Management and Disposal) Rules, 2006 and the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016 were not considered when the order was passed. The petitioner also argued that the order was passed without notice to the persons likely to be affected by it.

The court rejected a review petition opposing compliance with the MSW Rules of 2000, stating that even if the C&D Disposal Rules are being implemented, 5,600 MT of Municipal Solid Waste (excluding C&D waste) is being illegally dumped every day in the City. The court also rejected the argument that the MSW Rules of 2016 make it unnecessary for the Corporation to comply with the order of the court dated 2nd April 2013. The court directed the State Government and/or the Municipal Corporation to undertake a scientific assessment of the impact on the generation of municipal solid waste including construction waste in the city by construction of new buildings and new development projects.

The court order rejects a submission for accommodation in new buildings in distant suburbs of Mumbai at a cost of approximately Rs.2 lakhs. The
