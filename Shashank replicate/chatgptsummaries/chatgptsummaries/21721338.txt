The Supreme Court of India has taken a strong stance on the issue of solid waste management in the country. In a recent order, the court has directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to issue a communication to all state governments within two weeks, requiring information about the setting up of State Level Advisory Bodies (SLABs) and the steps taken for implementation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The court has noted that there is no seriousness attached to solid waste management, with some SLABs not even meeting once in six months. The court has also highlighted the lack of initiative or willingness to take positive steps for solid waste management, despite the availability of funds.

The court has urged the Health Minister of Delhi to urgently call a meeting of the Body he is chairing with regard to solid waste management. The court has ordered Mr. Satinder Jain to call a meeting within four weeks to discuss solid waste management and include Ms. Almitra Patel, Ms. Bharati Chaturvedi, and possibly the CEO of the United Residents Joint Action. The court has also directed the MOEF to follow up with state governments and warn them of heavy costs if they do not provide accurate information.

The court has listed the matter for February 6, 2018, and expects a plan of action and strategy for solid waste management in Delhi to be prepared and replicated in other parts of the country. The court has emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to solid waste management, which includes segregation at source, collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal. The court has also stressed the importance of public participation in the process.

The court has observed that the problem of solid waste management is not limited to Delhi but is a nationwide issue. The court has noted that the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, provide for the setting up of SLABs at the state level, which are responsible for monitoring and implementing the rules. However, the court has found that many SLABs are not functioning effectively, and there is a lack of coordination between different agencies involved in solid waste management.

The court has directed the MOEF to take steps to ensure that SLABs are set up and functioning effectively in all states. The court has also directed the MOEF to take steps to ensure that the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, are implemented effectively. The court has emphasized the need for strict enforcement of the rules and has warned that non-compliance will result in heavy costs.

The court has also highlighted the need for public awareness and education on the issue of solid waste management. The court has directed the MOEF to take steps to create awareness among the public about the importance of segregation at source, and the need to reduce, reuse, and recycle waste. The court has also directed the MOEF to take steps to create awareness among the public about the health and environmental hazards of improper solid waste management.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court of India has taken a strong stance on the issue of solid waste management in the country. The court has directed the MOEF to take steps to ensure that SLABs are set up and functioning effectively in all states, and the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, are implemented effectively. The court has emphasized the need for a comprehensive approach to solid waste management, which includes segregation at source, collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal. The court has also stressed the importance of public participation in the process and the need for public awareness and education on the issue.
