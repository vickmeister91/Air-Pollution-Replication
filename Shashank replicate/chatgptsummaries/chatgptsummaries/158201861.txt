The case in question involves a revision filed by the petitioner-accused against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Hanumangarh. The order in question had reversed the order of the Judicial Magistrate, Hanumangarh, which had directed the summoning of statements of witnesses who were examined during the investigation but were not cited as witnesses in the charge-sheet.

The petitioner-accused had argued that the statements of these witnesses were necessary for the framing of charges against him. However, the High Court held that the accused has to be supplied with only such documents which the prosecution chooses to rely upon as per the provisions of Section 207 IPC. The statements of such witnesses who are not cited by the prosecution as their witnesses cannot be summoned under the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. at the stage of framing of charges.

The High Court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 207 of the IPC requires the prosecution to supply the accused with a copy of the police report and other documents on which the prosecution intends to rely. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the accused is aware of the evidence against him and has a fair opportunity to defend himself.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the High Court held that this provision cannot be used to summon the statements of witnesses who are not cited by the prosecution as their witnesses.

The High Court's decision is significant because it clarifies the scope of the accused's right to access evidence against him. The accused is entitled to access only those documents on which the prosecution intends to rely. The accused cannot demand access to documents or statements that are not part of the prosecution's case.

The High Court's decision also underscores the importance of the prosecution's role in criminal proceedings. The prosecution has the responsibility to present a case against the accused based on the evidence available to it. The prosecution cannot be compelled to present evidence that it does not consider relevant or necessary for the case.

In conclusion, the High Court's decision in this case provides important guidance on the scope of the accused's right to access evidence against him. The accused is entitled to access only those documents on which the prosecution intends to rely. The accused cannot demand access to documents or statements that are not part of the prosecution's case. The decision also underscores the importance of the prosecution's role in criminal proceedings and its responsibility to present a case based on the evidence available to it.
