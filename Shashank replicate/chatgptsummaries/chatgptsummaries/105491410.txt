In the first court order, the State of Orissa appealed a judgment and order by the High Court of Orissa that allowed M/s Mesco Steels Ltd. to execute a mining lease for an area measuring 1519.980 hectares. The State Government had imposed conditions on the lease, including the requirement that the lessee set up two full-fledged steel plants within a reasonable time and utilize the entire iron ore extracted from the lease area for meeting the captive requirement of the steel plants. The High Court quashed an inter-departmental communication and directed the State Government to execute a formal mining lease in favor of the respondent-company. The State of Orissa argued that the writ petition was premature and not maintainable against a mere inter-departmental letter.

The second court order discusses a writ petition filed by a company against an inter-departmental letter from the government regarding the reduction of lease area. The court determines that the writ petition was premature as no final decision had been made by the government. The court also rules that the show cause notice issued by the government was not without jurisdiction and should be considered by the government before any further action is taken. The court sets aside the judgment of the High Court and directs the respondent-company to submit a reply to the show cause notice within three months.

The third court order was issued on March 6, 2013, by T.S. Thakur and Gyan Sudha Misra in New Delhi, but no information was provided about the content or subject of the order.
