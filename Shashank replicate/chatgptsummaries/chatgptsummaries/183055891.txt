The court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by M/S. Friends Oriental Arts and Mr. Sanjeev Anand against the State (Wild Life Department) regarding the possession of excess ivory articles without legal procurement or authority. The appellants were convicted under Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the court upheld the conviction and sentence, rejecting the appellants' arguments.

The order provides details of the raid conducted on the appellants' business premises and the seizure of ivory articles. The court found that the witness, CW-1, had sufficient experience to differentiate between articles made of ivory and those that were not. CW-1 identified the ivory through physical and visual examination and extracted Indian ivory from imported ivory using a formula.

The court rejected the argument that the case property was not properly sealed and found the accused guilty of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The weighing machine used to weigh the ivory was provided by the accused, and the court found no evidence that it was faulty.

The court sentenced appellant No. 1 to pay a fine and appellant No. 2 to undergo six months of simple imprisonment and pay a fine. The appeal was dismissed, and the trial court record was sent back.
