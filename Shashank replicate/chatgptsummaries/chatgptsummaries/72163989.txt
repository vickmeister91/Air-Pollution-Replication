The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to environmental clearances for various projects in India. In one case, the gram panchayat of Navlakh Umbre filed a public interest litigation challenging the environmental clearances granted to Hindustan Electricity Generation Company Private Limited for setting up a 355 MW combined cycle power project. The court heard the case for final disposal with the consent of all parties and discussed the timeline of events leading up to the filing of the petition. The court also noted that the Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued a notification in 2006 requiring prior environmental clearance for setting up new projects or activities falling within the purview of the notification.

In another case, the project proponent had applied for expansion without receiving environmental clearance, and a criminal complaint was filed against them and members of the SEAC and SEIAA. The court quashed the process against the SEAC and SEIAA and directed the SEIAA to consider the application for environmental clearance without insisting on the installation of machinery or expansion. The project proponent later withdrew their proposal for expansion.

In yet another case, the Sixth Respondent had carried out tree cutting, leveling, and filling work without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The State Government had directed the Sixth Respondent to furnish a written communication stating that the violations of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 would not be repeated. The Division Bench directed the Sixth Respondent to submit a resolution to the Environment Department of the State Government to the effect that neither the Sixth Respondent nor its directors had committed any violations of the Environment (Protection) Act 1986 or the rules. The Supreme Court directed that the permission granted to the Sixth Respondent shall remain in abeyance. The Petitioners sought to challenge the orders passed by the SEAC and sought a direction to shift the proposed project to an alternate industrial site. The court heard arguments from both sides and discussed the lack of jurisdiction and lack of application of mind in the SEAC's recommendations.

The court order also discusses the requirements for obtaining environmental clearance for new projects or activities in India. The State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) is responsible for granting clearance for projects falling under Category B, such as thermal power plants with a capacity of less than 500 MWs. The SEIAA must base its decision on the recommendations of the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC), which is composed of experts from diverse fields and considers relevant material before making recommendations. The court also addresses issues related to the SEAC's jurisdiction and the validity of studies conducted for the project. The order ultimately upholds the grant of environmental clearance for the project in question.

The court order outlines the mandatory procedure for conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies for a project. The SEAC is responsible for finalizing the terms of reference for the EIA studies, conducting the studies, preparing a draft EIA report, holding a public consultation, preparing a final EIA report, and submitting it to the SEAC for scrutiny. The SEAC must address environmental concerns and make recommendations to the SEIAA for granting or rejecting environmental clearance. The SEAC must perform its duties with accountability and responsiveness, keeping in mind the principles of sustainable development, access to information, access to justice, and governance based on the rule of law. The SEAC in this case failed to follow the mandatory procedure and did not consider relevant factors, leading to a recommendation for approval without proper scrutiny.

The court order discusses a decision made by the SEAC to recommend the grant of prior environmental clearance for a proposed project, subject to certain conditions being met. However, the court finds that the SEAC did not properly analyze the environmental concerns and impacts of the project, and did not demonstrate a due application of mind. The court emphasizes the importance of transparent and accountable decision-making processes in matters of environmental governance, and cites the concept of sustainable development as a guiding principle. The court also notes that the doctrine of Public Trust requires the government to protect resources for the enjoyment of the public.

The court order discusses the doctrine of Public Trust, which requires the government to protect resources for the enjoyment of the general public rather than for private ownership or commercial purposes. The court also recognizes the principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, and polluter-pays principle. The order emphasizes the need for a balance between developmental needs and environmental damage and degradation. The court also mentions previous cases where the government was held responsible for protecting historical tanks and ecologically fragile land.

In one case, the court found that the decision made by the SEIAA was flawed for several reasons, including a lack of consideration for environmental concerns and objections raised against the project. The SEAC's recommendation was also found to be invalid and contrary to the law. The court ordered that the SEAC must make a fresh decision on the application submitted by the Sixth Respondent in accordance with the law. The court did not make a finding of fact on the allegation that the Sixth Respondent had violated the notification dated 14 September 2006 by proceeding with development work before receiving environmental clearance. This issue was left open to be adjudicated upon by the competent authority after giving both parties an opportunity to be heard. The court made no order as to costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and considering environmental concerns when granting environmental clearances for projects in India. The court emphasizes the need for transparent and accountable decision-making processes
