The first court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Tajinder Kaur against an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in a complaint filed by Kamajit Kaur against Sudershan Singh. The appellant challenged a portion of the order that made certain remarks against her. The court dismissed the appeal, stating that the appellant cannot expunge the remarks made against her in the order. The trial court record was sent back, and the appeal file was consigned to the record room.

The second court order is from the Additional Sessions Judge-04 of the South District Saket Court in New Delhi, regarding a criminal appeal with the case number 19/2012. The order is on page 6 out of 6 pages. No further information is provided.

In the first court order, Tajinder Kaur had filed a criminal appeal against an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate in a complaint filed by Kamajit Kaur against Sudershan Singh. The appellant had challenged a portion of the order that made certain remarks against her. However, the court dismissed the appeal, stating that the appellant cannot expunge the remarks made against her in the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the remarks made against Tajinder Kaur were not defamatory or derogatory in nature. The court also noted that the remarks were made in the context of the case and were relevant to the issues at hand. Therefore, the court held that the appellant cannot expunge the remarks made against her in the order.

The court also ordered that the trial court record be sent back and the appeal file be consigned to the record room. This means that the case will not be heard again and the order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate will stand.

In the second court order, no information is provided about the case or the nature of the appeal. The order is on page 6 out of 6 pages, which suggests that it may be a routine order or a final order in a long-standing case.

Overall, the first court order highlights the importance of context and relevance in legal proceedings. The court's decision to dismiss the appeal and uphold the order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate shows that legal decisions are based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The second court order, on the other hand, provides little information and leaves much to speculation.
