In the first court order, a writ petition was filed by P.V. Anvar against the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and others. The summary does not provide any information on the content of the order, but it is known that exhibits and annexures were submitted by both the petitioner and the respondents. The order was delivered on October 10, 2017.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition challenging the cancellation of an integrated consent granted to the petitioner for operating a water theme park under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the impugned order was passed. The court directed the Environmental Engineer of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to conduct a fresh inspection and file a report on compliance with statutory requirements.

The report stated that the conditions of consent to operate the park had been complied with, and the impugned order could be withdrawn. The petitioner was permitted to prefer an application for withdrawing the impugned order, and if the application was made, the same would be considered and an appropriate decision would be taken. The petitioner was allowed to run the park until a decision was taken on the application. The functioning of the park would be subject to the conditions already incorporated in the consent issued to the petitioner and any further conditions incorporated in the order to be passed by the second respondent.

The disposal of the writ petition was without prejudice to the contentions taken by the third respondent and his right to pursue W.P.(C).No.20189/2017.
