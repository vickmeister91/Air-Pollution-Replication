The court, while granting bail, imposed certain conditions on the petitioner, including appearing before the investigating officer within ten days, executing a bond of Rs. 40,000 with two sureties, and not repeating the offense or threatening the complainant or witnesses.

The court took a lenient view despite the petitioner's involvement in several other cases. The court observed that the petitioner had already been granted bail in those cases and that he had not violated any of the conditions imposed by the court.
