The Calcutta High Court recently heard a writ petition challenging the proposed shifting of the Band Stand bus stand to a new Inter-state Bus Terminus (ISBT) at Santragachi, Howrah. The writ petitioners argued that the shifting of the bus terminus was in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and that the High Power Committee's decision to shift the terminus lacked reasons and violated the principles of natural justice. The petitioners also argued that the State Government had no role to play in addressing pollution caused to the Victoria Memorial, as it fell within the purview of a Central Legislation under The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court heard arguments from both sides and delivered its judgment on July 15, 2016.

The court order states that when a power is given to do a specific act in a specific manner, it must be exercised in that manner and not in any other way. The court also notes that the issue of pollution and relocation of bus termini is already being heard in a PIL before the Hon'ble Division Bench, and therefore a standalone writ petition on the same issue is not maintainable. The court further states that the principle of natural justice has been complied with, and the HPC has been given the mandate to submit quarterly reports on the steps taken to minimize pollution. The court also notes that the HPC has been given a three-year time limit to execute its action to keep the area pollution-free. The court concludes that the HPC's decision to shift the inter-state bus terminus from Band Stand to KCBT is not drastic and provides necessary windows for loading and unloading passengers.

The court order discusses a PIL regarding the pollution threat to Victoria Memorial in Kolkata. The Hon'ble Division Bench has issued orders from time to time, and the court is considering the relocation of the bus stand to ease the pollution threat. The court has appointed a High Power Committee to prepare a comprehensive report suggesting the modalities to be adopted for the purpose of removal of the pollution hazards in the heart of the city within three kilometers radius of the Victoria Memorial. The court has also noticed the several orders passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court on the issue of the pollution threat to VM. The court has also mentioned the findings of the Sub-committee of the HPC after hearing the concerned parties.

The court order discusses the decision-making process regarding the relocation of bus terminuses in Kolkata to reduce pollution around Victoria Memorial. The court finds no fault in the decision-making process and upholds the resolution to shift the bus terminus to KCBT, Santragachi, in a phased manner. The court also notes that the issues raised in the writ petition lie in the realm of expert bodies and refrains from interfering in their detailed exercise. The petition for stay of operation of the judgment is rejected.
