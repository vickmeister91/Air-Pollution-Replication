The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently granted bail to Priyatam Singh and Jagannath Singh, who were arrested in connection with a forest crime. The prosecution alleged that the applicants and co-accused hunted a bear by planting live electrical wire. However, the court allowed the bail application as there was no direct evidence to connect the applicants with the crime, and they had no criminal past.

The court considered the fact that the applicants had been in custody for over a year and that the trial was likely to take a long time to conclude. The court also noted that the applicants had cooperated with the investigation and had not attempted to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses.

The court imposed certain conditions on the applicants as part of their bail. They were directed to cooperate in the trial and not leave India without prior permission of the trial court. The court also directed them to furnish a personal bond and surety bond of Rs. 50,000 each.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants was based on the principle that bail is the rule and jail is the exception. The court noted that the applicants were entitled to the presumption of innocence and that their right to personal liberty could not be curtailed without sufficient cause.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that the right to personal liberty is protected, even in cases where the allegations are serious. The court's decision also underscores the need for the prosecution to provide direct evidence to connect the accused with the crime, rather than relying on circumstantial evidence.

In conclusion, the High Court of Madhya Pradesh's decision to grant bail to Priyatam Singh and Jagannath Singh is a welcome development in the ongoing fight to protect the rights of the accused. The court's decision serves as a reminder that the right to personal liberty is a fundamental right that must be protected at all times.
