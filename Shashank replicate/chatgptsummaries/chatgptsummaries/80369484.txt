The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard a case brought by Neeraj Chourasiya against the State of M.P. and others regarding the construction of a stormwater drain that could potentially carry untreated sewage water upstream of the river Betwa, causing a serious health hazard. The Tribunal ordered the Municipal Council Vidisha to resubmit its Detailed Project Report to the Regional Office of the Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (MPPCB) for examination and suggestions on preventing untreated sewage from entering the river and setting up a sewage treatment plant at a proper location. The MPPCB was also directed to monitor the site and discharge from the plant of M/s Satya Sai Agro Oils (Pvt.) Ltd. and ensure that no effluent discharge without being treated is allowed to pollute the water.

The NGT's order was in response to a petition filed by Neeraj Chourasiya, who had alleged that the construction of a stormwater drain by the Municipal Council Vidisha would lead to the discharge of untreated sewage water into the river Betwa, which would cause serious health hazards to the people living in the area. The NGT observed that the construction of the stormwater drain was in violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
