The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) has been granted the power to issue guidelines on the minimum distance required to set up a crusher machine near a forest, according to a recent court ruling. The decision was made in response to a writ petition filed by Prakash Kumar Pasari & Co. against the State of Jharkhand and others, in which the petitioner argued that the JSPCB did not have the authority to issue such guidelines.

The court cited a previous judgment in support of its decision, and vacated an interim order dated 31.3.2010. The ruling is significant because it clarifies the JSPCB's role in regulating the establishment of crusher machines near forests, which can have a significant impact on the environment.

The case highlights the importance of environmental regulations and the need for clear guidelines to ensure that businesses operate in a sustainable and responsible manner. The JSPCB's guidelines are designed to protect the environment and prevent pollution, and the court's decision affirms the Board's authority to enforce these guidelines.

The ruling also underscores the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that government agencies are held accountable for their actions. By affirming the JSPCB's authority to issue guidelines on crusher machines near forests, the court has sent a clear message that environmental protection is a priority and that businesses must comply with regulations designed to safeguard the environment.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for environmental protection in Jharkhand and serves as a reminder of the importance of clear regulations and the need for government agencies to enforce them. It also highlights the role of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that government agencies are held accountable for their actions.
