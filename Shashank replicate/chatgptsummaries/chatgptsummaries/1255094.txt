The case in question involved the establishment of a Steel Re-rolling Mill within the prohibited zone of Himayatsagar and Osman Sagar lakes. The A.P. Pollution Control Board had filed a writ petition questioning the orders passed by the Appellate Authority in Appeal No. 3 of 1998 and IA No. 5 of 1998. The appellate authority had allowed the establishment of the mill, despite it being located within the prohibited zone.

The Andhra High Court found that the appellate authority had committed a manifest error in determining whether the village in question fell within the purview of the relevant government orders. The court noted that the village was located within the prohibited zone, and therefore the establishment of the mill was not permissible.

The court remitted the matter to the petitioner for consideration afresh. The court directed the petitioner to determine whether the industry is polluting or not. The court noted that the establishment of the mill would be permissible only if it is not polluting.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to government orders and regulations. The court's decision also underscores the need for industries to be mindful of their impact on the environment.

In conclusion, the Andhra High Court's decision in the case involving the establishment of a Steel Re-rolling Mill within the prohibited zone of Himayatsagar and Osman Sagar lakes is a reminder of the importance of adhering to government orders and regulations. The court's decision also highlights the need for industries to be mindful of their impact on the environment. The court's decision to remit the matter to the petitioner for consideration afresh, with the question of whether the industry is polluting or not to be determined by the petitioner, is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that industries operate in an environmentally responsible manner.
