The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a group of individuals residing in Nehru Nagar Co-op. Hsg.Soc.Ltd. and Basera Co-op. Hsg.Soc.Ltd. against various government bodies and private entities. The respondents include the State of Maharashtra, the Administrator and the Divisional Commission-Konkan Division, Mumbai, the Union of India, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, Khapridev Co-operative Housing Society Ltd., the Mumbai Housing & Area Development Board, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, Basera CHS Ltd., Nehru Nagar CHS Ltd., M/s.Shivalik Ventures Pvt.Ltd., and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. The details of the case are not provided in the summary.

In another case, the court order pertains to a dispute over the development of a slum area in Mumbai. The petitioners, who are occupants of structures on the plot, objected to further development work by the respondent, citing the lack of prior environmental clearance. The Competent Authority had approved a Slum Rehabilitation Scheme to accommodate eligible slum dwellers, and the petitioners were members of two separate societies. The court considered the eligibility of the petitioners for rehabilitation and the issue of environmental clearance. The judgment was reserved on December 1, 2009, and pronounced on December 10, 2009.

The court order discusses a case where the appellants were occupying structures without prior environmental clearance. The SEIAA had taken cognizance of the matter and referred it to the SRA for confirmation. The court observed that the only ground for not vacating the structures was the absence of prior environmental clearance. The court directed the Competent Authority to ascertain the availability of environmental clearance and if available, to give 7 days' notice to the appellants to vacate their structures. The present writ petition challenges this order and the notice issued by the Executive Engineer/Bandra Division, Mumbai Board of MHADA. The court had initially ordered status quo in regard to the numbered plot, but later modified the order to only apply to the structures occupied by the petitioners. The Respondents have filed a reply affidavit stating that the plot number mentioned in the impugned decision was a clerical error.

The court order discusses a case related to the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme and a plot of land in Mumbai. The court clarifies that a clerical error was made in a previous judgment, which was later corrected by a corrigendum. The court also determines that the developer, Respondent No.10, cannot proceed with any work of development on the plot without prior environmental clearance. The court notes that the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme was approved on the basis of a Redevelopment Scheme submitted by two separate societies and that the Respondent No.10 was authorized to undertake the Redevelopment Scheme on terms and conditions specified by the Competent Authority while approving the said Scheme. The court also discusses the Notification dated 27th January 1994 and the Notification dated 7th July 2004 related to environmental clearance. The court concludes that the project is not covered by the Notification pressed into service by the Petitioners dated 27th January 1994.

The court order discusses a dispute over a slum rehabilitation project and whether it had the necessary environmental clearance to proceed. The court found that the project was covered under a new notification from 2006 and had been granted environmental clearance. The court also found that a notice of eviction issued by the Executive Engineer was invalid because it did not confirm that environmental clearance had been obtained. The court ordered the notice to be set aside and for a new notice to be issued in accordance with the law. The court also noted that most of the slum dwellers had already vacated their structures.

The court order states that the petitioners are eligible for alternate transit accommodation or rental amount in lieu thereof, and the appropriate authority must abide by the direction given by the Administrator regarding environmental clearance. The eviction notice issued by the Executive Engineer is set aside, and a fresh notice can only be issued after recording satisfaction about the environmental clearance. The judgment does not express an opinion on the merits of the issues involved in the environmental clearance or the eligibility of some petitioners. The assurance given by Respondent No.10 to provide transit accommodation or rental amount is accepted, subject to the decision of the Appellate Authority on the eligibility of some petitioners. The petition is partly allowed on these terms with no order as to costs.
