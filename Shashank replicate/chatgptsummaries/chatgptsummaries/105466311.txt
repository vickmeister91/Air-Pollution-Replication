The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by a man named Ramnaresh, who was in custody for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. Ramnaresh's counsel argued that the offence was not serious and that he should be granted bail. The court ultimately granted the bail application, but with certain conditions.

Firstly, Ramnaresh was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000. This means that he had to provide a written promise to the court that he would appear for all future court hearings related to his case. If he failed to do so, he would be in breach of his bond and could face further legal consequences.

In addition to the personal bond, Ramnaresh was also required to furnish a surety bond of the same amount. A surety bond is a promise made by a third party (in this case, someone who knows Ramnaresh and is willing to vouch for him) to pay the court the full amount of the bond if Ramnaresh fails to appear for his court hearings. This is meant to provide an additional layer of security to ensure that Ramnaresh does not flee or otherwise evade justice.

It is important to note that the court order is only effective until the end of the trial. This means that Ramnaresh will be required to comply with the conditions of his bail until his case is fully resolved. If he is found guilty of the offence he has been charged with, he may face additional penalties and consequences.

Finally, the court order specifies that it will become ineffective in the event of a bail jump. This means that if Ramnaresh were to violate the conditions of his bail (for example, by failing to appear for a court hearing), the bail order would be revoked and he would be taken back into custody. This is meant to deter individuals from attempting to flee or evade justice while out on bail.

Overall, the court order in question grants bail to Ramnaresh, but with certain conditions designed to ensure that he appears for all future court hearings and does not attempt to evade justice. While the order is only effective until the end of the trial, Ramnaresh will be required to comply with its conditions until his case is fully resolved.
