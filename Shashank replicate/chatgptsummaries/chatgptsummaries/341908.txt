The court order in question is related to a writ petition filed by Prabir Kumar Das, a human rights activist, on behalf of Pratap Naik. Naik had been illegally detained for over eight years despite being acquitted by the court. The petition sought compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs for Naik for the violation of his fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the state must compensate Naik for the violation of his fundamental right to liberty. The court directed the state to deposit a sum of Rs. 8 lakhs by way of bank draft drawn in the name of Pratap Naik. Additionally, the court directed the Registrar (Judicial) to open a fixed deposit account in the name of Pratap Naik in any nationalised bank for a period of ten years.

The court allowed Naik to draw 75% of the interest accrued on the fixed deposit every month. This was done to ensure that Naik has a regular source of income for the next ten years, as he had lost eight years of his life due to the illegal detention. The court also directed the state to pay the remaining 25% of the interest accrued on the fixed deposit to Naik after the ten-year period is over.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution. The court's decision also sends a strong message to the state that it cannot violate the fundamental rights of its citizens with impunity.

The compensation awarded to Naik is a small step towards justice for him, but it is a significant one. It acknowledges the harm that was done to him and provides him with some measure of financial security for the next ten years.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of human rights activism in India. Without the efforts of activists like Prabir Kumar Das, cases like Naik's may never come to light, and the state may continue to violate the fundamental rights of its citizens without consequence.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the writ petition filed by Prabir Kumar Das on behalf of Pratap Naik is a significant one. It upholds the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution and provides some measure of justice for Naik. The decision also sends a strong message to the state that it cannot violate the fundamental rights of its citizens with impunity. Finally, the decision highlights the importance of human rights activism in India and the role that activists like Prabir Kumar Das play in ensuring that the state is held accountable for its actions.
