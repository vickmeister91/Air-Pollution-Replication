The court order pertains to a case where the plaintiff, who runs an electroplating business, had his electricity supply disconnected by the defendant without any notice. The plaintiff alleges that the disconnection was done on the directions of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), but he had already submitted a reply denying any violation of the Air Pollution Act. The defendant claims that the disconnection was due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain a valid consent order from the DPCC. The plaintiff seeks a temporary injunction to restore his electricity supply during the pendency of the suit. The court examines the prima facie case and concludes that the plaintiff's previous consent order was only valid for three years, and any implied consent should be treated accordingly. The court orders the defendant to restore the plaintiff's electricity supply during the pendency of the suit.
