The Allahabad High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a public interest litigation filed by Dr. Ravindra Shukla and two others regarding the issuance of arms licenses without the prior concurrence of the Chief Wild Life Warden, in violation of the provisions of Section 34 (3) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court directed the competent authority to take necessary steps in accordance with the law in pursuance of notices to show cause which have been issued to arms license holders who do not have the NOC of the Chief Wild Life Warden.

The court also issued a general direction that no license under the Arms Act, 1959 shall be granted in the State of U.P. without the NOC of the Chief Wild Life Warden in those areas which fall within the purview of Section 34 of the Act of 1972.

The court order is a result of the petition filed by Dr. Ravindra Shukla and two others, who had raised concerns about the issuance of arms licenses without the prior concurrence of the Chief Wild Life Warden.

The court, after hearing the arguments of the petitioners and the respondents, directed the competent authority to take necessary steps in accordance with the law in pursuance of notices to show cause which have been issued to arms license holders who do not have the NOC of the Chief Wild Life Warden.
