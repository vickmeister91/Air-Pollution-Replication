The court has granted bail to Shabbir, who was involved in Case Crime No. 176 of 2019 under Sections 3(1) of U.P. Gangsters and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, Police Station Safdarganj, District Barabanki. This decision comes after the Special Judge, U.P. Gangster and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act/A.S.J., court no. 9, Barabanki, had rejected Shabbir's bail plea. However, the court has imposed certain conditions on Shabbir's release on bail.

One of the conditions is that Shabbir must file an undertaking not to seek adjournment on dates fixed for evidence. This means that Shabbir must be present in court on the dates fixed for evidence and cannot delay the proceedings by seeking adjournments. This condition ensures that the trial proceeds smoothly and without unnecessary delays.

Another condition imposed by the court is that Shabbir must remain present before the trial court on each date fixed. This condition is also aimed at ensuring that the trial proceeds smoothly and without any delays. Shabbir must be present in court on each date fixed, and failure to do so may result in the cancellation of his bail.

It is important to note that the court has granted bail to Shabbir, but this does not mean that he is acquitted of the charges against him. The trial will continue, and Shabbir will have to appear in court on each date fixed. The conditions imposed by the court ensure that Shabbir does not delay the proceedings and that the trial proceeds smoothly.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Shabbir, who was involved in Case Crime No. 176 of 2019 under Sections 3(1) of U.P. Gangsters and Anti Social Activities (Prevention) Act, Police Station Safdarganj, District Barabanki. The court has imposed certain conditions on Shabbir's release on bail, including filing an undertaking not to seek adjournment on dates fixed for evidence and remaining present before the trial court on each date fixed. These conditions ensure that the trial proceeds smoothly and without any delays. It is important to note that the grant of bail does not mean that Shabbir is acquitted of the charges against him, and the trial will continue.
