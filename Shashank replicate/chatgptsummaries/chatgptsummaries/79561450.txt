In a recent court order, a writ petition filed by M/s Ayyappa Minerals seeking a mandamus to issue a mining lease in their favor was dismissed. The petitioner argued that there was a letter of intent from the state government to grant the lease. However, the court cited a Supreme Court decision that stated that such a letter could not be issued without prior approval from the central government. As there was no such approval in this case, the writ petition was dismissed.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the central government before issuing a letter of intent for mining leases. The court's decision is in line with the Supreme Court's ruling that the central government has the final say in granting mining leases.

The petitioner's argument that there was a letter of intent from the state government to grant the lease was not sufficient to override the requirement for central government approval. The court's decision underscores the need for strict adherence to the legal requirements for granting mining leases.

The court's decision also has implications for other industries that require government approvals. It serves as a reminder that all necessary approvals must be obtained before proceeding with any project. Failure to do so can result in legal challenges and delays.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case emphasizes the importance of following legal procedures and obtaining all necessary approvals before proceeding with any project. It also highlights the need for strict adherence to the legal requirements for granting mining leases. The ruling serves as a reminder to all industries that require government approvals to ensure that they have obtained all necessary approvals before proceeding with any project.
