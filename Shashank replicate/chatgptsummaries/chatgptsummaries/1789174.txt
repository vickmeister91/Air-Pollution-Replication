The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to cases involving forest land in Kerala, India. In one case, the plaintiff and defendants were co-owners of a 30-acre property in Thiruvananthapuram District, and the plaintiff sought half of it. The State of Kerala was impleaded as the 8th defendant, but no permanent relief was sought against it. The Divisional Forest Officer filed appeals against the preliminary and final decrees, which were obtained by fraud and collusion, and the lower appellate court dismissed the suit. The common questions of law were whether the Divisional Forest Officer was entitled to file an appeal against the decree and whether the State of Kerala was already a party.

In another case, the plaintiff had asked for a temporary injunction against the State from issuing pattayams with regard to a property. The State was declared ex parte and a preliminary decree for partition was passed. The State filed an application to set aside the ex parte preliminary decree, which was dismissed. A final decree was passed, and the D.F.O. filed appeals against the preliminary and final decrees. The appeals were allowed by the District Judge, but the plaintiff questioned the maintainability of the appeals filed by the D.F.O. The court held that the D.F.O. was not a person aggrieved by the decrees and that the State, who was the party defendant, could have filed appeals against the decrees. The court also noted that the State had not filed any appeal against the decrees and that the doctrine of "issue estoppel" and "cause of action estoppel" would get attracted.

The court order also discusses the provisions for how the Indian government and states can sue or be sued in court. It emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying the parties involved and ensuring that necessary parties are included in the proceedings. The Chief Conservator of Forest is deemed a misdescription for the State of Andhra Pradesh and the state should be impleaded as a necessary party in any proceedings involving its property. Failure to include necessary parties can result in the case being dismissed.

In another case, the lower appellate court was wrong in allowing appeals filed by the D.F.O. in his official capacity and not on behalf of the State. The suit property is a forest land, but the parties were only dividing their possessory right over the land, and the State was not a necessary party in such a suit. The court also notes that the present suit was pertaining to the same forest land which was the subject matter of an earlier litigation, and therefore, the dispute put forward by the plaintiff between his own brothers and sisters was only a paper fight. The court concludes that the present suit was not maintainable and was misconceived, and Section 11 C.P.C. squarely applied attracting the bar of res judicata to the present suit.

In another case, the State has the right to take legal action to recover possession of the land from the plaintiff, but it does not prejudice the plaintiff's claim for assignment of the land from the State based on their possession. The court also recognizes the principle that no injunction can be maintained against the true owner. The court notes that the 30 acres of land in question is a forest land and the State has an obligation to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests and wildlife. The State is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment, and encroachers or trespassers of government forest land cannot claim any protection or right to continue in possession. The court cites relevant sections of the Kerala Forest Act and previous judgments to support its decision.

In another case, the court found that the State and its agencies have a duty to preserve and protect forest land, and that the public trust doctrine applies to government reserve forests and river purambokkes. The court also noted that a decree obtained by fraud or collusion is a nullity and can be recalled by the court. The court commended the Divisional Forest Officers and the District Judge for their commitment to preserving the forest land. The court dismissed the Second Appeals and awarded costs to the respondents.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of correctly identifying parties involved in cases involving forest land and ensuring that necessary parties are included in the proceedings. They also emphasize the duty of the State and its agencies to preserve and protect forest land and the public trust doctrine that applies to government reserve forests and river purambokkes. The court also notes that decrees obtained by fraud or collusion are nullities and can be recalled by the court.
