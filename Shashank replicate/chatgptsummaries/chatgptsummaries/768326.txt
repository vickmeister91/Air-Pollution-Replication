The court order in question pertains to a quarry lease that was granted to the petitioner for a period of 10 years. However, the forest department cancelled the lease on the grounds that the area was covered by a notification under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The petitioner challenged the cancellation through writ petitions, but the court ultimately upheld the cancellation.

The court's decision was based on Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, which bars any non-forest activities in areas covered by Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act. The court found that the area in question was indeed covered by Section 4, and therefore the cancellation of the lease was justified.

The petitioner had argued that the quarry lease had been granted prior to the notification under Section 4, and therefore should not be affected by it. However, the court found that the notification had been issued prior to the grant of the lease, and therefore the lease was subject to the notification.

The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the cancellation of the lease violated their fundamental right to carry on their business. The court found that the right to carry on business was subject to reasonable restrictions, and that the cancellation of the lease was a reasonable restriction in the interest of protecting the environment.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need to balance economic development with conservation efforts. While the cancellation of the quarry lease may have been a setback for the petitioner, it was ultimately deemed necessary in order to protect the forested area in question.
