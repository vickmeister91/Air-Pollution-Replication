The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed a petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh State Board for Prevention and Control of Pollution against Andhra Pradesh Rayons Ltd. The issue at hand was whether the company, which manufactures Rayon Grade Pulp, a base material for synthetics or man-made fabrics, was subject to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Act provides for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by specified industries. 

The court held that Rayon Grade Pulp did not fall under any of the industries listed in Schedule I of the Act and that the Act must be strictly construed. The court order discusses a case where the respondent filed an appeal before the Appellate Committee under the Act, which was confirmed by the committee. The respondent then filed a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Act and the levy of cess on water. The High Court rejected the constitutional validity contention but upheld the contention that the respondent's industry was not liable to pay cess as it was not mentioned in Schedule I of the Act.

The court concludes that the Rayon Grade Pulp industry is not covered by any of the items specified in Schedule I and is not liable to pay cess. The court emphasizes that the Act is fiscal in nature and must be strictly construed. The court also discusses the principle of understanding in "common parlance" and notes that no evidence was presented on how the expressions are used in the particular industry or understood in the trade generally. The court rejects the petitioner's contention that Rayon Grade Pulp is covered by Item No. 7 (chemical industry), Item No. 10 (textile industry), or Item No. 11 (paper industry) of Schedule I.

In another case, the court order discusses a case where the Kerala High Court held that an industry manufacturing rayon-grade pulp is a chemical industry. However, the Supreme Court disagrees with this reasoning, stating that if every industry that goes through a chemical process were considered a chemical industry, then every industry would fall under this category. The court explains the manufacturing process of rayon-grade pulp and concludes that it should not be considered a chemical industry. The petition is dismissed.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of strict interpretation of fiscal laws and the need for evidence to support claims made in court. The court also emphasizes the principle of understanding in "common parlance" and the importance of considering the specific industry and trade practices when interpreting laws. 

Overall, the court's decision in these cases provides clarity on the applicability of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 to the Rayon Grade Pulp industry and emphasizes the need for evidence-based decision-making in legal proceedings.
