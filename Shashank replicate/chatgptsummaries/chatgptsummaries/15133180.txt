The Madras High Court recently heard multiple cases related to the construction and operation of a bottling factory by LA Bottlers Private Ltd. in Suriyur Village, Trichy District. The cases included an appeal against a Single Judge's order, a petition to remove unauthorized construction, and a petition to close and seal the factory. The court heard arguments from all parties involved and issued a common judgment. LA Bottlers Private Ltd. was referred to as the petitioner company.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the classification of land for a bottling unit owned by L.A. Bottlers Private Ltd. The company had purchased land classified as "Mixed Residential Zone" and applied for reclassification to "Controlled Industrial Zone" to set up the bottling unit. The application was rejected by the government, citing public resentment and unrest. The company had obtained various permissions and licenses from different authorities, except for the change of land classification. The main issue was the drawal of groundwater in large quantities from borewells, causing depletion of water table in a drought-stricken area. The court remitted the matter of reclassification to the government for fresh consideration, giving due opportunity to the petitioner company and all related parties within ten weeks.

The court order states that the petitioner company, LA Bottlers Private Limited, did not have the necessary approvals for the construction and installation of their factory. The company also did not have a valid land conversion approval or building plan approval. The court found that the company had circumvented basic statutory provisions to facilitate the construction and installation of the factory and machinery. The court ordered the closure and sealing of the factory and the removal of unauthorized construction. The court also noted that water resources are vital for the existence of the factory and that the company's undertaking not to draw water from wells dug by them was a tacit acknowledgment of the depletion of the water table due to their usage.

The court order discusses a dispute over the change of land use for a factory in Suriyur Village. The first respondent/writ petitioner claims that the newly elected seventh respondent has developed animosity towards them and has repeatedly visited the factory demanding that they not draw any ground water without authorization. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has granted consent to the factory, but objections have been raised by the public and the sixth respondent. The court has remanded the matter to the second respondent for fresh consideration. The appellant in W.A.(MD)No.976 of 2017 and the petitioners in W.P.(MD).Nos.5915 of 2017 and 11718 of 2014 argue that the Local Body is not competent to accord necessary approval/permission and that the first respondent has managed to get clearances from various authorities without necessary approval from DTCP. They also argue that the factory's usage of large quantities of water will deplete the ground water level and affect agricultural operations. The court has not yet made a final decision on the matter.

The court order states that the second respondent acted in accordance with the law by rejecting an application for land use conversion. The court considered various documents and certificates issued to the first respondent, including a No Objection Certificate, permission to construct, and licenses to store compressed gas and import and store petroleum. However, the court also noted objections from the Local Body and public sentiments, and ultimately upheld the rejection of the application.

The court order discusses the various permissions and objections related to a factory in Suriyur Village. The Local Body had granted permission for the factory, but objections were raised by some residents and authorities regarding land conversion and water usage. The court notes that necessary licenses and approvals were obtained from concerned authorities, and that the Local Body had acted as a single window agency for obtaining necessary permissions. The court also points out that the doctrine of indoor management applies in this case, and that the factory cannot be sealed solely on the basis of public agitation and law and order concerns. The court suggests that post-facto approval may be granted by the Director of Town and Country Planning, subject to relevant norms and regulations.

The court order lists the permitted uses for two different zones: Primary Residential Use Zone and Controlled Industrial Use Zone. The court also references previous judgments on the importance of balancing environmental protection and industrialization through sustainable development. The court ultimately dismisses a writ appeal and two writ petitions, stating that a private commercial venture cannot disregard public sentiment and the law of the land. The court directs the registry to place the papers before the Chief Justice for further action.
