In a recent court case, the petitioner sought to quash a criminal complaint against him under various Acts related to forest and land preservation. The petitioner claimed that the land in question was private agricultural land and not covered by the Acts. However, the court found that the land had been designated as private forest land and that the petitioner had not taken any steps to have the case heard after a related writ petition was dismissed. As a result, the court dismissed the petition to quash the complaint.

The case centered around a piece of land that the petitioner claimed was private agricultural land and therefore not subject to the Acts related to forest and land preservation. However, the court found that the land had been designated as private forest land and was therefore subject to the Acts. The petitioner argued that the designation was made without proper notice or opportunity to be heard, but the court found that the petitioner had not taken any steps to challenge the designation.

The petitioner had previously filed a writ petition challenging the designation of the land as private forest land, but the writ petition was dismissed. Despite this, the petitioner did not take any further action to challenge the designation or to have the criminal complaint against him heard. As a result, the court found that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies and dismissed the petition to quash the complaint.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting all available remedies before seeking relief in court. In this case, the petitioner had not taken any steps to challenge the designation of the land as private forest land after his writ petition was dismissed. As a result, the court found that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies and dismissed the petition to quash the complaint.

Overall, the court's decision serves as a reminder that individuals must take all necessary steps to challenge a designation or complaint before seeking relief in court. Failure to do so may result in the dismissal of a petition or complaint, as was the case in this instance.
