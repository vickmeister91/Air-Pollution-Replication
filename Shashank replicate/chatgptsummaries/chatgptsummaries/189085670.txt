The court order pertains to a batch of Civil Revision Petitions filed by the District Forest Officer and the State of Tamil Nadu against Perumal. The petitioners sought to set aside the order passed by the Additional District Judge, Fast Tract Court, Namakkal in I.A. No.209/2006 in unnumbered CMA of 2006, dated 23.062011. The delay in filing the appeal ranged between 990 to 1100 days. The subject lands were acquired by the Government in 1955 and were declared as Reserve Forest Lands. The Forest Settlement Officer excluded the lands of the claimants from the Reserve Forest Area without getting sanction/approval of the Government. The court allowed a similar batch of Civil Revision Petitions in CRP No.4153 of 2011 and quashed the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition to condone the delay.

The court order discusses a case involving forest lands and encroachment by third parties. The Forest Department was delayed in filing appeals due to administrative issues and the retrieval of old records. The court allows the Department to contest the remaining cases by condoning the delay in filing the appeals. The order also mentions the extension of the period for filing an appeal by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest due to various reasons, including the delay in receiving orders from the Forest Settlement Officer.

The court order discusses the Forest Settlement Officer's failure to follow proper procedure in admitting claims for land, which goes against the Tamil Nadu Forest Act and Forest (Conservation) Act. The District Forest Officer has taken action to file appeals against these orders, but there has been a delay due to administrative procedures. The government has accepted the reasons for the delay and has allowed for the appeals to be filed. The court also references a previous case where it was determined that Section 10 (2) of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act only applies to appeals made by claimants against rejection of their claims, not appeals made by the District Forest Officer.

The court order discusses the condoning of a delay in filing an appeal on behalf of the government by a forest officer. The court below accepted the reasons given for the delay and exercised its discretion in the interest of protecting the government's rights. The court finds no reason to interfere with the order passed by the court below. The subsequent developments in the case have not been brought to the notice of the court below, and the delay in filing the appeal should be condoned. The delay was due to the staff of the department verifying voluminous records, and the explanation offered by the petitioner is plausible.

The court has allowed the Civil Revision Petitions and the applications filed by the revision petitioners under Section 5 of the Limitation Act in unnumbered Civil Miscellaneous Appeals, as the delay in filing the appeals was due to plausible reasons and not mere administrative delay. The court has set aside the impugned orders and allowed all the Civil Revision Petitions. No costs are to be paid.
