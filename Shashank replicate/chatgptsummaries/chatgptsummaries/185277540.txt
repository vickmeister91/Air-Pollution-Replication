The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Jeetu S/O Shri Kumarsingh B/C Thakur, who was arrested for illegal mining of minerals. The petitioner sought regular bail in F.I.R. No. 39/2019 registered at Police Station Sarmathura, Distt. Dholpur, for offences under Section 379 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, Section 29/51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 and Section 30, 31, 32, 41, 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both the petitioner and the prosecution, allowed the petition and ordered the release of the petitioner on bail, subject to satisfaction of the Trial Court. The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioner, such as furnishing a personal bond and surety bond, cooperating with the investigation, and not leaving the country without prior permission from the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was based on several factors. Firstly, the court noted that the petitioner had no prior criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. Secondly, the court observed that the investigation in the case was still ongoing and that the petitioner had been in custody for a considerable period of time. Thirdly, the court took into account the fact that the offences alleged against the petitioner were bailable in nature.

The court also considered the arguments put forth by the prosecution, which had opposed the grant of bail to the petitioner. The prosecution had argued that the petitioner was a habitual offender and that his release on bail would hamper the investigation. However, the court found these arguments to be unconvincing and held that the petitioner was entitled to bail.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner in this case was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, as well as the relevant legal provisions. The court's order serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice and ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected, even in cases where serious offences are alleged.
