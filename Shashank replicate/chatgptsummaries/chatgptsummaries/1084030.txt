The Kerala High Court recently issued an order regarding the filling of pits left unfilled after large scale excavation of clay for brick manufacturing. The court directed the District Collector to ensure that a Geologist files an action taken report every six months regarding the filling of these pits. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by a group of individuals who were concerned about the environmental impact of the unfilled pits.

The court noted that private parties who had entered appearance in the case were yet to place any counter affidavit on record. This suggests that the parties may not have a strong argument against the petitioners' claims. The court's decision to order regular action taken reports from a Geologist indicates that they take the issue seriously and want to ensure that the pits are filled in a timely and responsible manner.

The filling of pits left after excavation is an important environmental issue. These pits can pose a danger to wildlife and can also lead to soil erosion and other environmental problems. It is important that they are filled in as soon as possible to minimize their impact on the environment.

The court's order is a positive step towards addressing this issue. By requiring regular action taken reports, the court is ensuring that progress is being made towards filling the pits. This will help to protect the environment and ensure that the area remains safe for wildlife and humans alike.

It is also worth noting that the court's order highlights the importance of private parties taking responsibility for their actions. The fact that they have not yet placed any counter affidavit on record suggests that they may not be taking the issue seriously enough. It is important that all parties involved in large scale excavation take responsibility for the impact of their actions on the environment.

Overall, the Kerala High Court's order is an important step towards addressing the issue of unfilled pits left after large scale excavation. By requiring regular action taken reports, the court is ensuring that progress is being made towards filling the pits and protecting the environment. It is important that all parties involved in large scale excavation take responsibility for their actions and work towards minimizing their impact on the environment.
