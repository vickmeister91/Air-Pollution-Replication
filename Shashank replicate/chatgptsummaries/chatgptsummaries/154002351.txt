The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Chakresh Kumar Jain against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others. The petitioner had been appointed as a Contract Teacher Grade-2 in Arts Faculty, but his appointment was cancelled due to irregularities committed in the selection process. The cancellation was based on an enquiry report that found that the petitioner's credentials of having experience in teaching in non-formal education were not attached to the application, but marks towards experience were interpolated later. 

The petitioner challenged the cancellation, claiming that he was not given an opportunity to be heard. However, the court held that in cases where fraud or deceit is involved, an appointment acquired through such means is not valid, and the principle of natural justice is not set in a straight jacket form. The court found no material on record to contradict the finding that marks were interpolated in the tabulation sheet, and therefore dismissed the petition.

The court's decision was based on the principle that appointments made through fraudulent means cannot be allowed to stand. The petitioner's claim that he was not given an opportunity to be heard was not considered relevant in light of the evidence of fraud. The court found that the irregularities in the selection process were serious enough to warrant the cancellation of the petitioner's appointment.

The court's decision is significant because it upholds the principle of natural justice while also recognizing the importance of preventing fraud in the selection process. The court's decision sends a strong message that fraudulent practices will not be tolerated in the selection of candidates for government positions.

The case between Chakresh Kumar Jain and the State of Madhya Pradesh and five others was scheduled to be posted on May 11, 2012, and was issued by Judge Sanjay Yadav. No further information is provided about the case.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Chakresh Kumar Jain v. State of Madhya Pradesh and others upholds the principle of natural justice while also recognizing the importance of preventing fraud in the selection process. The court's decision sends a strong message that fraudulent practices will not be tolerated in the selection of candidates for government positions. The case highlights the need for transparency and fairness in the selection process, and the importance of ensuring that appointments are made on the basis of merit and qualifications rather than through fraudulent means.
