The National Green Tribunal (NGT) heard a case brought by the Goa Foundation and Peaceful Society against the Union of India and various state governments and pollution control boards. The applicants requested that the respondents not issue any consent or clearance for activities in the Western Ghats area, which had been demarcated as environmentally sensitive zones. The tribunal considered the case and issued an order, but the details of the order are not provided in the text.

The Western Ghats is a mountain range that runs parallel to the western coast of India, covering an area of approximately 140,000 square kilometers. The region is known for its rich biodiversity and is home to many endangered species. However, the Western Ghats have been facing threats from various activities such as mining, deforestation, and construction of dams and roads. The NGT order pertains to the protection and preservation of the Western Ghats in India.

The court directs the respondents to discharge their obligations under the respective enactments mentioned in Schedule I of the NGT Act, 2010 for the protection and preservation of the Western Ghats. The court also orders the implementation of recommendations made in the report submitted by the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) to protect the Western Ghats. The MoEF is expected to discharge and perform its statutory obligations expeditiously and in accordance with the law. The Ministry is going to take further appropriate action, including issuing a fresh draft notification in that behalf.

The court order directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to define eco-sensitive areas in the Western Ghats region and issue a final notification with utmost expeditiousness to ensure the interests of all stakeholders are not jeopardized. The MoEF is also directed to maintain the environmental tranquility and ecology of the areas under consideration and not allow irreversible alteration of the areas by granting Environmental Clearance or permitting activities that would have an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive areas. The order also allows parties to approach the Tribunal for seeking clarification or further directions in consonance with the judgment of the Tribunal.

The NGT order is significant as it recognizes the importance of protecting the Western Ghats, which is a crucial ecological hotspot in India. The order directs the MoEF to take necessary steps to protect the region and ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded. The order also emphasizes the need to maintain the environmental tranquility and ecology of the areas under consideration and not allow irreversible alteration of the areas by granting Environmental Clearance or permitting activities that would have an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive areas.

The NGT order is a step in the right direction towards protecting the Western Ghats and ensuring that the region's ecological balance is maintained. The order recognizes the importance of preserving the region's biodiversity and the need to take necessary steps to protect it. The MoEF's role in defining eco-sensitive areas and issuing a final notification is crucial in ensuring that the interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded.

In conclusion, the NGT order pertaining to the protection and preservation of the Western Ghats is a significant step towards safeguarding the region's ecological balance. The order directs the MoEF to take necessary steps to protect the region and ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are safeguarded. The order also emphasizes the need to maintain the environmental tranquility and ecology of the areas under consideration and not allow irreversible alteration of the areas by granting Environmental Clearance or permitting activities that would have an adverse impact on the eco-sensitive areas. The NGT order is a positive development towards protecting the Western Ghats and ensuring that the region's biodiversity is preserved for future generations.
