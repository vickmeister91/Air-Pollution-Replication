The case of Sunil Kumar, a government contractor, involved his application for the renewal of a quarrying permit and the issuance of a 'P-form' for the purpose of doubling the railway track between Chengannoor and Thiruvalla. However, the Geologist did not consider the application of the petitioner for want of environmental clearance. The court held that the Geologist shall renew the permit to the limited extent of removing earth of the quantity mentioned in the letter issued by the Executive Engineer, Southern Railway, after ascertaining the required quantity already removed and used for filling Railway Track. The petitioner shall follow all other relevant rules, and this direction is only to renew the permit without obtaining environmental clearance for the purpose of the railway line.

The petitioner, Sunil Kumar, had approached the Geologist for the renewal of his quarrying permit and the issuance of a 'P-form' for the purpose of doubling the railway track between Chengannoor and Thiruvalla. However, the Geologist did not consider the application of the petitioner for want of environmental clearance. The petitioner then approached the court seeking relief.

The court held that the Geologist shall renew the permit to the limited extent of removing earth of the quantity mentioned in the letter issued by the Executive Engineer, Southern Railway, after ascertaining the required quantity already removed and used for filling Railway Track. The petitioner shall follow all other relevant rules, and this direction is only to renew the permit without obtaining environmental clearance for the purpose of the railway line.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had already removed a certain amount of earth for the purpose of filling the railway track. The court held that the Geologist should renew the permit to the extent of the remaining earth required for the purpose of doubling the railway track. The court also directed the petitioner to follow all other relevant rules and regulations.

The court held that the Geologist had not considered the application of the petitioner for want of environmental clearance. This highlights the need for government officials to consider all relevant factors before making a decision.
