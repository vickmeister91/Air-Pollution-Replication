The court order in question pertains to an appeal against an order of the Subordinate Judge returning the plaint of the plaintiff in a partition suit to be filed in the proper court. The plaintiff was absent during the hearing, and the defendant presented evidence to show that the Alipur Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The plaintiff appealed on two grounds: (1) that the court should have dismissed the suit altogether as the plaintiff was absent, and (2) that the evidence did not justify the conclusion that the court had no jurisdiction. The court held that the proper rule applicable was Order 17, Rule 3, and that the evidence presented was sufficient to justify the conclusion that the court had no jurisdiction. The appeal was dismissed.

The case in question involves a partition suit filed by the plaintiff in the Alipur Court. The defendant argued that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and presented evidence to support this claim. The plaintiff was absent during the hearing, and the court returned the plaint to be filed in the proper court. The plaintiff appealed this decision on two grounds: firstly, that the court should have dismissed the suit altogether as the plaintiff was absent, and secondly, that the evidence presented did not justify the conclusion that the court had no jurisdiction.

The court held that the proper rule applicable in this case was Order 17, Rule 3, which states that if a party fails to appear on the day fixed for hearing, the court may proceed with the case in their absence or adjourn the hearing. The court noted that in this case, the defendant had presented evidence to show that the Alipur Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The court found this evidence to be sufficient to justify the conclusion that the court had no jurisdiction.

The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the suit should have been dismissed altogether due to their absence. The court noted that Order 9, Rule 8 provides for the dismissal of a suit if the plaintiff fails to appear on the day fixed for hearing and does not apply for an adjournment. However, in this case, the defendant had presented evidence to challenge the jurisdiction of the court, and the court was required to consider this evidence before dismissing the suit.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal and upheld the decision of the Subordinate Judge to return the plaint to be filed in the proper court. The court held that the defendant had presented sufficient evidence to show that the Alipur Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and that the proper rule applicable in this case was Order 17, Rule 3. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the suit should have been dismissed altogether due to their absence, as the defendant had presented evidence challenging the jurisdiction of the court.
