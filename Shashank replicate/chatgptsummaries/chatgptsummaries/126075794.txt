The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Vinod under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail. Vinod was arrested in connection with Crime No. 9873/2019 registered at Police Station Game range Officer, National Chambal Wild Life Sanctuary, Devri, District Morena under the provisions of Sections 27, 29, 50, 51 & 52 of Wild Life Protection Act and section 41 & 52 of Indian Forest Act. The allegation against Vinod is that he was caught along with other co-accused persons and two trucks loaded with illegal sand excavated from the river without having valid royalty and legal documents for the same.

The court allowed the bail application and directed Vinod to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000/- with two solvent local sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned trial Court. The order also lists six conditions that Vinod must comply with, including cooperating in the investigation/trial and not committing a similar offence.

The first condition of the bail order requires Vinod to cooperate with the investigation and trial. This means that he must provide any information or evidence that is requested of him by the authorities. Failure to do so could result in the revocation of his bail.

The second condition requires Vinod to attend all court hearings related to his case. This is a standard condition for bail and ensures that the accused does not abscond or evade justice.

The third condition prohibits Vinod from leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission. This is to ensure that he remains within the reach of the authorities and does not flee the country.

The fourth condition requires Vinod to surrender his passport, if he has one, to the authorities. This is to prevent him from leaving the country without permission and to ensure that he remains within the jurisdiction of the court.

The fifth condition prohibits Vinod from tampering with any evidence or influencing any witnesses related to his case. This is to ensure that the trial is fair and that justice is served.

The sixth and final condition prohibits Vinod from committing a similar offence while he is out on bail. This is to ensure that he does not engage in any illegal activities while he is awaiting trial.

Overall, the court order grants Vinod bail but imposes several conditions that he must comply with. These conditions are designed to ensure that he cooperates with the authorities, attends all court hearings, remains within the jurisdiction of the court, does not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses, and does not commit any further offences. Failure to comply with these conditions could result in the revocation of his bail and his return to custody.
