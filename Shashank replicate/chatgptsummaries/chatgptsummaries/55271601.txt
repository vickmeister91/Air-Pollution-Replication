The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Deepak Kumar against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The court issued several directions to the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state pollution control board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, due to ongoing maintenance work, water samples from distributories could not be collected. The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over records of the case. The State was warned of a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if they failed to submit the plans. The court ordered the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date and imposed a cost if the State failed to submit the plans and action report.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and prevention of pollution in canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and directed the state to file a compliance report. The state was found to have a lethargic attitude towards implementing the court's orders, and the court warned of appropriate action if the orders were not complied with.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and pollution of water meant for drinking. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties approach the NGT for relief, as it has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and the circumstances under which a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued.

The court order states that a writ of certiorari can be issued even if an appeal or revision is available, if the inferior court or tribunal has committed a patent error that cannot be cured by other remedies. However, the court may still insist on using alternative remedies if they are efficacious. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court, but the court found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and the petitioner had not exhausted all other remedies. The writ petition was dismissed, but the petitioner was allowed to withdraw it with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by December 31, 2016. The NGT was expected to consider the delay caused by the pending writ petition sympathetically.
