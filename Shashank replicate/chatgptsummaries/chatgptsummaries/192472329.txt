The court order summaries provided relate to various writ petitions filed against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the State of Maharashtra. The petitions allege irregularities in the selection process for the post of Field Officer, including the appointment of ineligible candidates, violation of government policies and guidelines, and fraudulent selection procedures. The court heard all the petitions together and disposed of them by a common order.

One of the petitions, Writ Petition No.3608 of 2010, provides relevant facts and submissions. The court ordered a detailed inquiry into the matter, as the petitioner alleged that the advertisement for the post was published without authority, and that the selection process was in violation of government policies and guidelines. The court found that the appointment of additional candidates was not unlawful and that the MPCB had followed the Recruitment Rules. However, the court also found various irregularities committed by the MPCB in making appointments, including the appointment of over-age candidates, those with more than two children, and candidates without the required qualifications. The appointments of candidates under the project affected persons category were also illegal, as they were not recommended by the District Collector and did not follow due procedure. The court quashed the entire selection process and directed the MPCB to hold a new selection process.

In another case, the court found that the selection committee had pre-determined the names of the candidates to be selected and had given the same marks to all candidates in different categories. The court declared all appointments made by the MPCB to be illegal and in violation of recruitment rules and constitutional provisions. The court rejected the MPCB's arguments that the same marks given to all candidates were not a crime and that there was no actionable claim.

The court also found that the MPCB did not follow the reservation policy for women and other categories, and did not prepare a roster since 2000. The selection committee allegedly made appointments without prior permission from the government, and increased the reservation percentage beyond the permissible limit. The selection process was conducted during the Code of Conduct period without written permission from the State Election Commission. The MPCB has been accused of committing fraud and violating government resolutions and Supreme Court principles. All appointments made by the MPCB are subject to the outcome of the petitions.

The court order also lists the names, ages, occupations, and addresses of several individuals who work for the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board in various sub-regional and regional offices throughout the state. The purpose of this information is not clear from the given text.

In conclusion, the court order summaries provided relate to various writ petitions filed against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and the State of Maharashtra. The petitions allege irregularities in the selection process for the post of Field Officer, including the appointment of ineligible candidates, violation of government policies and guidelines, and fraudulent selection procedures. The court found various irregularities committed by the MPCB in making appointments and quashed the entire selection process, directing the MPCB to hold a new selection process. All appointments made by the MPCB are subject to the outcome of the petitions.
