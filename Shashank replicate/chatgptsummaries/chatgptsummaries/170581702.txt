The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Dayal Chand against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals in Sri Ganganagar district. The petition was filed after Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh filed a PIL in 2009 regarding the same issue. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) was eventually tasked with adjudicating the matter, and several orders were passed, including directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances into the canal and to remove platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme to prevent discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments on the water bodies. The NGT also directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal.

The court order directs the State to take steps to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of distributories and canals. The State and local authorities are to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through publication of notices. The court also requests records from a related case and sets a hearing date. Later orders direct the State to remove all encroachments within one month and issue show cause notices to those contributing to pollution. The State is also directed to remove structures causing contamination and submit compliance reports.

The court order directs the removal of existing structures in an area meant for maintenance of a canal, as they are causing contamination of the canal water. The state is directed to remove these structures and file a compliance report. The court also orders the state to prepare a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The state is directed to issue notices to persons from whose premises or whereabouts inlets into the canal originate, to show cause as to why they should not be made to pay compensation for causing pollution. The court orders the removal of all encroachments within one month and directs the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner of Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide all assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The court also directs the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases relating to the environment.

The court order discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching a writ court, which is subject to several checks and is discretionary. The court concludes that the petitioner's argument that the tribunal exceeded its jurisdictional authority by issuing interim directions without examining the question pertaining to limitation has no merit. The court also notes that the remedy given under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India and that the writ court should be extremely slow in entertaining any issue which is under the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court has ordered that an appropriate application/representation be filed by December 31, 2016 in the Original Application Nos. 86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Until then, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone the delay and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the State can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition has been disposed of.
