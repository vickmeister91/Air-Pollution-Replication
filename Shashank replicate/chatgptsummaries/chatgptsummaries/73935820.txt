The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the possession and trade of Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool, which is a scheduled animal under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The accused in each case was charged with violating the provisions of the Act and faced trial in court.

In the first case, Firdose Ahmed was found in possession of 11 Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool. The accused was convicted under section 55 of the Act and sentenced on 16 April 2014. The court heard testimony from witnesses, including the complainant and members of the raiding team, and examined relevant provisions of the Act. The accused had pleaded not guilty.

In the second case, the accused was charged with dealing in Shahtoosh shawls derived from Tibetan Antelope, which is a scheduled animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The prosecution failed to prove the charges under sections 44 and 49B(1) of the Act, but the accused was found guilty under section 49 for possessing the shawls illegally. The defence counsel argued that the Act did not apply in Jammu & Kashmir, but the court rejected this argument. The defence also claimed that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses' testimonies, but the court found them to be minor and not significant enough to dismiss the evidence. Ultimately, the accused was convicted under section 49 of the Act.

In the third case, the accused was found in possession of 11 Shahtoosh Shawls made from Tibetan Antelope without any license or authority. The defense argued that there were minor contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witness and that the expert opinion/report was not reliable. However, the court held that minor discrepancies in testimony are normal and that the recovered shawls were identified by competent wildlife inspectors. The accused's defense of being falsely implicated was also dismissed as he failed to provide any evidence to disprove the prosecution's case. The court found the accused guilty of contravening the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act and convicted him accordingly. The accused was given the opportunity to be heard on sentence.

The fourth court order was announced by ACMM (Special Acts) Devendra Kumar Sharma at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi on April 16, 2014. The order pertained to a case between WLI and Firdose Ahmed and consisted of 14 pages with an additional spare copy attached.

In all of these cases, the accused were found guilty of violating the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, by possessing or dealing in Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool. The court heard testimony from witnesses and examined relevant provisions of the Act to arrive at its decision. The defence counsel in each case attempted to argue that the Act did not apply or that there were inconsistencies in the prosecution's case, but the court rejected these arguments and found the accused guilty.

The court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of protecting endangered species and the consequences of violating wildlife protection laws. The possession and trade of Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool is illegal and punishable under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court's decision to convict the accused in each case sends a strong message that such violations will not be tolerated and that those who engage in such activities will be held accountable.
