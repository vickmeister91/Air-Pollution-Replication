The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S. Gayathri Rock Products, a partnership firm that operates a crusher unit in Ward No.1 of Tarur Grama Panchayat. The petitioner had submitted an application for renewal of trade license and consent to operate as required under the provisions of Air (prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Water (prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the statutory respondents had not passed any order either rejecting or allowing the application for consent/renewal of license within a period of thirty days from the date of submission of the application before the Industrial Single Window Clearance Board.

The court found that since there was no order passed by any of the statutory respondents, the petitioner has become entitled to a deemed license and consent for the period for which the same was applied. The court directed the 1st respondent to issue a certificate indicating that the petitioner has obtained a deemed license/consent for the period for which the license/consent was applied, within two weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the principle of deemed consent, which is a legal concept that allows an applicant to assume that their application has been granted if the relevant authority fails to respond within a specified time frame. This principle is particularly relevant in cases where delays in processing applications can cause significant harm to the applicant's business or operations.

In this case, the petitioner had applied for renewal of their trade license and consent to operate, which are essential for the continued operation of their crusher unit. However, the statutory respondents had failed to respond within the stipulated time frame, leaving the petitioner in a state of uncertainty regarding the status of their application.

The court's decision to grant the petitioner a deemed license and consent for the period for which the same was applied is a significant victory for the petitioner, as it ensures that their operations can continue without interruption. The court's direction to the 1st respondent to issue a certificate indicating the same is also crucial, as it provides the petitioner with a formal document that they can use to demonstrate their compliance with the relevant laws and regulations.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive development for businesses operating in similar circumstances, as it reinforces the principle of deemed consent and provides a mechanism for applicants to obtain the necessary licenses and consents in a timely and efficient manner. It also highlights the importance of timely and efficient processing of applications by statutory authorities, as delays can have significant consequences for businesses and their operations.
