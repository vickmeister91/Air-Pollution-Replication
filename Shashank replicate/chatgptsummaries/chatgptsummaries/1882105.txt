Forest Friendly Camps Private Limited, the owner of hotels and a tour arranging business, challenged the Roster System introduced by the Rajasthan government for regulating tourism in the Ranthambore National Park. The system required vehicle owners to register their vehicles with the Forest Department and pay a fee for registration. Only registered vehicles were permitted to enter the park, and the department drew up a list of registered vehicles, allowing a limited number of vehicles to enter the park for each shift. 

The appellant argued that the system hampered tourism and affected foreign exchange earnings. However, the court held that the authorities were within their right to regulate entry and impose conditions for entry in the sanctuary. The court directed the appropriate authority to prepare a list of tour operators/hoteliers who regularly booked sufficient tourists for the park and provide them with the facility of one vehicle per trip in a day to enter the park, subject to fulfilling conditions under the Roster System and providing them with a guide of their choice.

The Ranthambore National Park is a popular tourist destination in Rajasthan, known for its tigers and other wildlife. The park is spread over an area of 392 sq km and is home to a variety of flora and fauna. The park is divided into several zones, and visitors are allowed to enter only the zone for which they have a permit. The Roster System was introduced to regulate the number of vehicles entering the park and to ensure that the park's ecosystem is not disturbed.

Forest Friendly Camps Private Limited challenged the Roster System, arguing that it hampered tourism and affected foreign exchange earnings. The company claimed that the system was arbitrary and did not take into account the needs of the tourism industry. The company also argued that the system was not transparent and that the Forest Department had not provided any justification for the fees charged for registration.

The court, however, held that the authorities were within their right to regulate entry and impose conditions for entry in the sanctuary. The court noted that the Roster System was introduced to protect the park's ecosystem and to ensure that the number of vehicles entering the park was regulated. The court also noted that the Forest Department had provided a justification for the fees charged for registration and that the fees were reasonable.

The court directed the appropriate authority to prepare a list of tour operators/hoteliers who regularly booked sufficient tourists for the park and provide them with the facility of one vehicle per trip in a day to enter the park, subject to fulfilling conditions under the Roster System and providing them with a guide of their choice. The court's decision was aimed at balancing the needs of the tourism industry with the need to protect the park's ecosystem.

The court's decision is significant as it recognizes the importance of regulating tourism in protected areas. The decision also highlights the need to balance the needs of the tourism industry with the need to protect the environment. The court's direction to prepare a list of tour operators/hoteliers who regularly book sufficient tourists for the park and provide them with the facility of one vehicle per trip in a day is a step towards ensuring that the tourism industry is not adversely affected while protecting the park's ecosystem.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Forest Friendly Camps Private Limited v. State of Rajasthan is a significant step towards regulating tourism in protected areas. The decision recognizes the importance of protecting the environment while balancing the needs of the tourism industry. The court's direction to prepare a list of tour operators/hoteliers who regularly book sufficient tourists for the park and provide them with the facility of one vehicle per trip in a day is a positive step towards achieving this balance.
