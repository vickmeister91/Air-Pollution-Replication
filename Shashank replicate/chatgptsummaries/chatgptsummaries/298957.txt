The Indian judiciary has been proactive in protecting the country's forests, which are critical to the country's ecological balance and the livelihoods of millions of people. In two separate court orders, the Supreme Court of India has issued several directions to protect and conserve forests throughout the country.

The first court order, issued in 1996, clarified that the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 applies to all forests, irrespective of ownership or classification. The court ruled that prior approval of the Central Government is required for any non-forest activity within the area of any forest. The court also directed each state government to constitute an expert committee to identify areas which are forests, irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognised or classified under any law, and to assess the sustainable capacity of the forests of the state qua saw mills and timber-based industry.

The court also issued several interim directions, including a ban on the movement of cut trees and timber from any of the seven North-Eastern States to any other state of the country. The court suspended all saw mills, veneer mills, and ply-wood mills in Tirap and Changlang in Arunachal Pradesh and within a distance of 100 Kms from its border, in Assam. These directions were aimed at preventing the illegal felling of trees and the transportation of timber from forests.

The second court order, issued in 1997, banned the felling of trees in forest areas, but allowed for the removal of fallen or diseased trees in non-notified areas. Private plantations that were not converted from forests were exempt from the ban. The state government was directed to form an expert committee to set norms for felling trees and ensure compliance. The order also prohibited private agencies from disposing of felled trees and required strict adherence to the Forest Conservation Act.

The court order allowed for the felling of shade trees in tea, coffee, and cardamom plantations under certain conditions and prohibited the expansion of plantations into forest areas. The order also addressed the use of wood by the railway authorities and provided job security for workers in wood-based industries affected by the ban.

These court orders were significant in protecting and conserving India's forests, which are under threat from deforestation, illegal logging, and encroachment. The orders ensured that the Forest Conservation Act was implemented effectively and that the state governments took proactive measures to protect forests. The orders also provided clarity on the use of wood and timber-based industries, ensuring that they operated within the framework of the law and did not contribute to the destruction of forests.

The orders were not without controversy, as they affected the livelihoods of many people who depended on the timber industry for their income. However, the court recognized the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection and ensured that the orders were implemented in a phased manner, giving affected industries time to adapt.

In conclusion, the court orders issued by the Supreme Court of India in 1996 and 1997 were significant in protecting and conserving India's forests. The orders clarified the application of the Forest Conservation Act, banned the illegal felling of trees, and provided guidelines for the use of wood and timber-based industries. The orders were a testament to the judiciary's commitment to environmental protection and the sustainable development of the country.
