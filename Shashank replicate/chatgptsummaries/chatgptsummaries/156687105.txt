The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Bhagat Ram in a case registered against him under Section 51 of the Wild Life Act, 1972. The petitioner had sought bail on the grounds that he had not shot the leopards and had cooperated fully with the investigation. The investigating officer informed the court that the leopard skins allegedly recovered from the buyers did not carry any gunshot holes, which further supported the petitioner's claim.

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court granted bail to the petitioner on certain conditions. These conditions included joining the investigation when required, not leaving India without permission, and not influencing witnesses. The court also clarified that the findings would not affect the merit of the case.

The case against Bhagat Ram was registered under Section 51 of the Wild Life Act, 1972, which prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal. The act also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any animal or animal product that has been obtained through illegal means.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was based on the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that he had shot the leopards. The investigating officer's report also supported this claim, as the leopard skins allegedly recovered from the buyers did not carry any gunshot holes.

The court's decision to grant bail on certain conditions was aimed at ensuring that the petitioner did not flee the country or influence witnesses. By joining the investigation when required, the petitioner would be able to assist the authorities in their efforts to bring the real culprits to justice.

The court's clarification that the findings would not affect the merit of the case was important, as it ensured that the investigation would continue and that the real culprits would be brought to justice. The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was not a reflection of his guilt or innocence, but rather a recognition of the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that he had shot the leopards.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Bhagat Ram in a case registered against him under Section 51 of the Wild Life Act, 1972, was based on the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that he had shot the leopards. The court's decision to grant bail on certain conditions was aimed at ensuring that the petitioner did not flee the country or influence witnesses.
