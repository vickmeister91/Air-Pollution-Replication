The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Shri P Puttappa against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had applied for the renewal of a quarrying lease, which was rejected by the Deputy Director on the grounds that the land falls within the forest land transferred to the Forest Department. The petitioner's counsel argued that a copy of the recommendation of the Deputy Conservator of Forests was not supplied to the petitioner.

The court found that no competent authority had recorded a finding that the land subject matter is a 'forest' or 'forest land' within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act,1980. The court noted that the Deputy Director had rejected the petitioner's application solely on the basis of the recommendation of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, without conducting any independent inquiry or assessment of the land in question.

The court observed that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 defines 'forest' and 'forest land' in a specific manner, and that the mere fact that the land in question may have some trees or vegetation does not necessarily make it a 'forest' or 'forest land'. The court noted that the Deputy Director had not conducted any survey or assessment of the land in question to determine whether it falls within the definition of 'forest' or 'forest land' under the Act.

The court further observed that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation that his application for renewal of lease would be considered on its merits, and that he would be given an opportunity to be heard before any decision was taken. The court found that the Deputy Director had failed to provide the petitioner with a copy of the recommendation of the Deputy Conservator of Forests, which had formed the basis of the impugned order.

In light of these findings, the court set aside the impugned order and directed the Deputy Director to reconsider the application for renewal of lease. The court directed that the application shall be decided as expeditiously as possible, and in any event within a period of two months from the date of the order.

This court order highlights the importance of following due process and conducting a proper assessment before making any decision that may affect the rights of individuals. It also emphasizes the need for transparency and accountability in decision-making, and the importance of providing individuals with an opportunity to be heard before any decision is taken.
