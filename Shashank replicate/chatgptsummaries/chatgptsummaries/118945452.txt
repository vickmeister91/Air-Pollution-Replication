The Madras High Court heard four writ appeals challenging a common order made in W.P.Nos.6243 and 6244 of 2006. The State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited and the Government of Tamil Nadu were the appellants, while Singapore Reality Private Limited was the respondent. The issue raised in these writ appeals being common, all the appeals were ordered to be heard together. The writ petitions filed by the respondent were not maintainable, according to the appellants, as the petitioner has chosen to trace its right based on the contract, and if alternative remedy of raising arbitrariness is available, the writ petitions ought not to have been entertained.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the cancellation of an allotment order for land in an Information Technology Park in Siruseri, Tamil Nadu. The petitioner, Singapore Realty Private Limited, had entered into an MOU with the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) to develop an integrated township consisting of 6,000 housing units. The SIPCOT had allotted 102 acres of land to the petitioner, with the condition that 2,000 housing units be constructed within three years. However, the petitioner failed to obtain environmental clearance and was issued a stop-work notice. The government subsequently cancelled the allotment order, which the petitioner challenged in court. The court found that the cancellation was justified as the petitioner had violated the conditions of the allotment order and failed to obtain necessary clearances.

The court order states that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) issued an Environmental Impact Assessment Notification in 1994, which requires any new construction projects to obtain prior environmental clearance before initiating the project. The petitioner company had not obtained this clearance and was undertaking construction work, which included building 6000 dwelling units within 102 acres of land owned by the SIPCOT Industrial Park. The MoEF ordered the project to stop immediately, and the Tamil Nadu government was directed to take action against the project proponent for violating the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The government later cancelled the project's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and allotment orders, stating that the project could not be completed due to the action initiated by the MoEF. The court found that the cancellation was premature and violated the principles of natural justice, as the petitioner had not been given notice or an opportunity to explain the pendency of their application for environmental clearance. The court also noted that the petitioner had not carried out any further construction work without obtaining environmental clearance.

The court order states that when a quasi-judicial or administrative authority is called upon to determine a dispute involving civil consequences, adherence to principles of natural justice is of supreme importance. The court can entertain a writ petition even if an alternative remedy is available, if there is a failure of principles of natural justice, violation of fundamental rights, or if the orders or proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction. The principle of Promissory Estoppel against the Government/Authority under Article 12 of the Constitution of India can be applied if a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice based on representations made by the Government/Authority. The court found that the impugned orders cancelling the MOU and allotment orders were unsustainable as the time to complete the project was not over and the reasons stated in the Government Order were not justified.

The court order states that the petitioner company had enough time to complete the project and the reasons given by the government for cancelling the allotment orders are not valid. The court also mentions that the government cannot invoke the provisions of The Government Grants Act, 1895 in this case. The court concludes that the writ appeals are dismissed and the connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

In summary, the Madras High Court heard four writ appeals challenging a common order made in W.P.Nos.6243 and 6244 of 2006. The State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited and the Government of Tamil Nadu were the appellants, while Singapore Reality Private Limited was the respondent.
