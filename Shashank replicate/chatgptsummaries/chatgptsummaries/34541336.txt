In the first court order, the complainant filed an application seeking the summoning of certain documents through an ex parte order. These documents included TDS certificates, bank deposit challans, income tax returns, TDS returns, and audited balance sheets. The complainant believed that these documents would prove that the accused were still acting as directors, which would be a violation of their bail conditions. However, the court found that the complainant was not sure about the accused's actions and that the issue had already been decided by the court's predecessor. Therefore, the application for summoning the documents was dismissed.

Moving on to the second court order, on August 10, 2011, a court order was announced in open court by ACMM (Spl. Act)/Central Delhi in the case of M/s Montreaux Resorts Pvt. Ltd vs Vikram Bakshi & Ors. Unfortunately, the details of the order were not provided in the given text.

In summary, the first court order dealt with an application for summoning documents that the complainant believed would prove that the accused were violating their bail conditions. However, the court found that the complainant was not sure about the accused's actions and that the issue had already been decided by the court's predecessor. Therefore, the application was dismissed. The second court order was announced in open court but no details were provided.
