The court order pertains to a public interest litigation filed by individuals seeking to preserve and conserve the Gopalnagar lake in Gujarat, which is a natural habitat for migratory birds. The land in question was reserved for recreational purposes in the Development Plan prepared by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority (AUDA), but builders and private contractors have persuaded the AUDA to make the land available for building purposes. The court directed the concerned authorities to survey the land and consider whether it should be preserved as a lake in the interest of birds and the environment. The State Wild Life Advisory Board was also found to be duly constituted. The AUDA confirmed that the land was previously reserved for recreational use but is now proposed for residential use in the revised Development Plan, which is pending approval from the State Government.
