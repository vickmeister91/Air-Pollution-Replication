The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Anand Ahirwar under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing an FIR lodged against him for an offense under Sections 39 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner did not appear for the hearing, and the court assumed that he had lost interest in prosecuting the petition. However, the petitioner was given the liberty to file an appropriate application for recalling the order on admissible grounds along with relevant documents.

The case involved allegations against Anand Ahirwar for violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act was enacted to provide for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading in wild animals and their products. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

An FIR was lodged against Anand Ahirwar for allegedly violating Sections 39 and 51 of the Act. Section 39 of the Act prohibits the hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 provides for punishment for offenses under the Act. Anand Ahirwar filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIR lodged against him.

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The section provides that nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

Anand Ahirwar's petition was dismissed by the court as he did not appear for the hearing. The court assumed that he had lost interest in prosecuting the petition. However, the court granted him the liberty to file an appropriate application for recalling the order on admissible grounds along with relevant documents.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with court procedures and appearing for hearings. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of a petition or case. However, the court also recognizes that there may be valid reasons for not appearing for a hearing, and therefore grants the liberty to file an appropriate application for recalling the order on admissible grounds along with relevant documents.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Anand Ahirwar's petition for quashing the FIR lodged against him for an offense under Sections 39 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, emphasizes the importance of complying with court procedures and appearing for hearings. The court's decision also recognizes that there may be valid reasons for not appearing for a hearing and grants the liberty to file an appropriate application for recalling the order on admissible grounds along with relevant documents.
