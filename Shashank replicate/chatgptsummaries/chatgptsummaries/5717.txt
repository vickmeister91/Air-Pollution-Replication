The court order pertains to a mining lease granted in 1966 in Madhya Pradesh, India. The lease was determined by the State Government in 1980, but was later challenged by the legal heirs of the lessee in a writ petition. The Madhya Pradesh High Court quashed the determination of the lease and ordered the matter to be re-examined by the State Government. However, no order was passed on the application filed by the legal heirs to permit mining operations for the balance period of the lease. The State Government subsequently sent demand notices for dead rent, claiming that the lease had expired due to efflux of time. The court order provides a detailed account of the legal proceedings and the facts of the case.

In 1986, a court order stated that the lessee did not hold a lease and therefore dead rent could not be demanded. The lessee made representations but filed a contempt petition in 1998, which was not entertained. The State Govt. responded in 1999, declining to extend the lease. The lessee filed a revision application, during which the State of Madhya Pradesh granted a lease to the M.P. State Mining Corporation. The Corporation filed a writ petition seeking directions to execute a lease deed, which was granted in 1999. The lessee filed another revision application in 1999, which was dismissed in 2002. The writ petitions were allowed in 2010, stating that the grant could not have been made in favor of the Corporation and that the lessee was entitled to the remaining unexpired period of the original lease. The State of Madhya Pradesh and the Corporation filed LPAs against this order.

The court order states that the judgment delivered by the Madhya Pradesh High Court on 16.07.1986 is binding and cannot be ignored. The original lease cannot be said to have expired on 02.11.1986 when it was made unworkable by wrongful determination of the lease. The period of mining lease lost was liable to be compensated by permitting mining activity for a further period to the extent of the loss of the period as per the original lease. The grant of 5 hectares of lease has been held to be illegal. The court also notes that the appellants seemed to be under a mistaken belief that the present case is one of renewal of a lease. The last aspect urged by learned counsel for the appellants is arising from the plea of lack of inherent jurisdiction in Delhi High Court.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to the Companies Act, 1956, and the relevance of previous judgments in similar cases. The court emphasizes the importance of adhering to directions passed by the court and focusing on the matter in issue to avoid wasting judicial time. The court ultimately dismisses the appeals and orders costs to be paid.
