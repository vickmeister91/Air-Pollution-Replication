In a recent court order, the Karnataka High Court allowed M/S Sri Venkateshwara Stone Crusher to continue operating their stone crushing unit until their application for relocation to a safer zone was considered and disposed of by the competent authority. The court also quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and ruled that the petitioner could operate their unit for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Sri Venkateshwara Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other authorities. The petitioner sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and sought permission to operate their stone crushing unit. The petitioner argued that they were a valid licensee and had obtained all necessary permissions and clearances to operate their unit.

The Karnataka Pollution Control Board, on the other hand, argued that the petitioner had violated several environmental norms and had caused pollution in the surrounding areas. The Board had issued a closure notice to the petitioner, directing them to stop all operations and to take necessary measures to prevent further pollution.

After hearing both sides, the court found that the petitioner was a valid licensee and had obtained all necessary permissions and clearances to operate their unit. The court also noted that the petitioner had applied for relocation to a safer zone, as per the directions of the Supreme Court, and that their application was pending before the competent authority.

In light of these facts, the court allowed the petitioner to continue operating their unit until their application for relocation was considered and disposed of by the competent authority. The court also quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and ruled that the petitioner could operate their unit for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions and clearances before starting any industrial activity. It also underscores the need for strict adherence to environmental norms and regulations to prevent pollution and protect the environment.

The court's decision to allow the petitioner to continue operating their unit until their application for relocation is considered and disposed of by the competent authority is a welcome move, as it provides relief to the petitioner and their employees. However, it is important to note that the court has also directed the petitioner to take necessary measures to prevent pollution and to comply with all environmental norms and regulations.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of M/S Sri Venkateshwara Stone Crusher v. State of Karnataka and others is a significant development in the field of environmental law. It highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions and clearances before starting any industrial activity and underscores the need for strict adherence to environmental norms and regulations to prevent pollution and protect the environment. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to continue operating their unit until their application for relocation is considered and disposed of by the competent authority is a welcome move, but it is important for the petitioner to comply with all environmental norms and regulations to prevent further pollution.
