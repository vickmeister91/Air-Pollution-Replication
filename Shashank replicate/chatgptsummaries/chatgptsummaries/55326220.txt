The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Khelan, who was facing charges under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant had expressed concerns about being falsely implicated in the case and had an apprehension of arrest. The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount.

The court also directed the applicant to make himself available for interrogation by the police officer and abide by the conditions mentioned in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. This section lays down the conditions that must be followed by a person who has been granted anticipatory bail. These conditions include cooperating with the investigation, not leaving the country without the permission of the court, and not tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

The decision to grant anticipatory bail is a significant one, as it allows the applicant to avoid arrest and detention. This is particularly important in cases where the accused has a genuine apprehension of arrest, but has not yet been formally charged with an offence. In such cases, anticipatory bail can provide a measure of relief and protection to the accused.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Khelan was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court was satisfied that the applicant had a genuine apprehension of arrest and that he had been falsely implicated in the case. The court also took into account the fact that the applicant had no previous criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the grant of anticipatory bail is also significant. These conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant cooperates with the investigation and does not interfere with the course of justice. By imposing these conditions, the court is able to balance the interests of the accused with the interests of justice.

Overall, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Khelan is a positive development in the case. It provides the applicant with some measure of relief and protection, while also ensuring that the investigation can proceed unhindered. The conditions imposed by the court are reasonable and necessary, and will help to ensure that justice is done in the case.
