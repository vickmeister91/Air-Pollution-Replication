In a recent court order, Babadeen and Jagat Singh were granted bail in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The court allowed the bail application on the ground of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail. The applicants were ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety each in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during trial and comply with the conditions of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

The case in question pertains to the violation of the Wildlife Protection Act, which is a serious offense. The act aims to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats, and any violation of the act can result in severe penalties. In this case, Babadeen and Jagat Singh were arrested for their alleged involvement in the violation of the act.

However, the court granted them bail on the ground of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail. This means that the court found that there was no reason to keep Babadeen and Jagat Singh in custody while their co-accused was out on bail. The court also ordered them to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety each in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during trial and comply with the conditions of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

Section 437 of Cr.P.C. lays down the conditions for granting bail in non-bailable offenses. According to this section, the court may grant bail to a person accused of a non-bailable offense if the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offense and that he is not likely to commit any offense while on bail.

In this case, the court found that Babadeen and Jagat Singh were not likely to commit any offense while on bail and that there were reasonable grounds for believing that they were not guilty of the offense. Therefore, the court granted them bail on the condition that they comply with the conditions of Section 437 of Cr.P.C.

The court also ordered them to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety each in the same amount. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that he will appear in court as and when required and will comply with all the conditions of the bail order. A solvent surety is a person who undertakes to pay the bail amount in case the accused fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of the bail order.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to Babadeen and Jagat Singh in connection with a wildlife protection act case on the ground of parity with a co-accused who had already been granted bail. The court ordered them to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety each in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during trial and comply with the conditions of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. This order highlights the importance of complying with the conditions of bail and the seriousness of offenses under the Wildlife Protection Act.
