The court order pertains to the recognition and vesting of forest rights in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The petitioners in the first court order had filed a writ petition seeking a direction to the State of Maharashtra to grant them right and title in respect of forest lands occupied by them. They had also sought a relaxation of conditions that would come in the way of granting them such rights. The petitioners had cited provisions of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 to support their claim. The court heard the case and issued a ruling.

The court examined the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act and noted that it was enacted to strike a balance between conservation of forest and the rights of tribals who were traditionally residing in the forest areas. The Act recognizes the rights of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who were residing in forest areas for generations together. The court directed the State Government to frame a policy to relax the condition of possession being of three generations in the interest of justice.

The court order also clarifies the definition of "generation" as a period of 25 years in the context of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. It also discusses the provisions of Section 4 of the Forest Rights Act, which recognizes and vests forest rights in these communities. The order considers the conditions under which forest rights may be modified or resettled in critical wildlife habitats, and emphasizes the importance of obtaining the free informed consent of affected communities.

The court order further states that the forest rights recognized and vested under this Act shall include the right of land to forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers who can establish that they were displaced from their dwelling and cultivation without land compensation due to State development interventions. The critical wildlife habitats from which rights holders are relocated for purposes of wildlife conservation shall not be subsequently diverted by the State Government or the Central Government or any other entity for other uses.

In another court order, the court discussed the provisions of a forest rights act, which grants forest land rights to certain communities and individuals. The act specifies different criteria for forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The former only need to show occupation of the land on a specific date, while the latter must prove occupation and dependence on the forest for three generations. The court found that the petitioners did not meet the criteria for the act and dismissed their petition. The court also noted the importance of preserving the ecology and forest for future generations.

The court order also directed the Central Government to recognize the "critical wild habitat of National Parks and Sanctuaries" within six months to ensure the protection of wildlife. The State Government must comply with the conditions required under sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Act to protect the rights of forest dwellers. The petition was rejected, and no costs were ordered. The Registrar (Judicial) was directed to forward a copy of the judgment and order to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forest, for necessary action. The Government Pleader was requested to forward a copy to the Secretary (Revenue and Forest Department), Mantralaya, Mumbai, to ensure compliance with the directions.

In summary, the court orders discussed the recognition and vesting of forest rights in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The court examined the provisions of the Forest Rights Act and directed the State Government to frame a policy to relax the condition of possession being of three generations in the interest of justice. The court also clarified the definition of "generation" as a period of 25 years in the context of forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The court emphasized the importance of obtaining the free informed consent of affected communities before modifying or resettling forest rights in critical wildlife habitats. The court also noted the importance of preserving the ecology and forest for future generations and directed the Central and State Governments to take necessary action to protect the rights of forest dwellers.
