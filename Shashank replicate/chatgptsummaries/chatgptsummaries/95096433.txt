The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest without conducting an inquiry or providing an opportunity for a hearing. The petitioners argued that this provision violated their rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. The State government defended the provision, stating that it was necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. 

The court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the provision, stating that it was necessary to protect the environment and preserve forest cover. The court emphasized the importance of protecting and improving the environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife. The court also highlighted the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle. 

The court order discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court emphasized the duty of the State and citizens to protect and improve the environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife. The court also highlighted the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle. 

The court dismissed writ petitions challenging the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area, stating that public interest and the interest of ecology, environment, health, safety, and composite culture cannot be compromised under private rights. The court also rejected the argument that termination of leases was illegal, as individual rights have to give way to the larger public interest. 

The court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is significant as it reaffirms the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. 

The court's dismissal of writ petitions challenging the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area is also significant. The court's decision underscores the importance of public interest and the interest of ecology, environment, health, safety, and composite culture over private rights. 

Overall, the court order is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to protect and preserve the environment in India. The court's decision to uphold the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, and its emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle are important steps towards achieving a balance between economic development and environmental protection. The court's dismissal of writ petitions challenging the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and prohibit mining activities in the area is also a positive development, as it underscores the importance of public interest and the interest of ecology, environment, health, safety, and composite culture over private rights.
