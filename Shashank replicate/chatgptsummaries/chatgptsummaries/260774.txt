The Aravalli Hill Range in Haryana has been a victim of extensive damage caused by mining activities. In response to this, the court has issued an order suspending all mining operations in the area. The State of Haryana has been directed to establish guidelines and procedures for granting licenses/leases for mining minor minerals in a designated area of 600 hectares in Faridabad. The State must adhere to all conditions enumerated in the Minutes of the Meeting held on 7.1.2009 between the C.E.C., State of Haryana and the Forest Survey of India regarding mining, colonization, and related issues in Aravalli hills. 

The court has also directed the State to take immediate steps for the preparation and implementation of a Reclamation and Rehabilitation Plan for the area degraded by mining activities. The leaseholders are responsible for the rehabilitation of those areas, and the state may hold them liable for not carrying out the rehabilitation work. The mining operation in the 600 ha. of land in Faridabad can commence only after the submission and approval of the rehabilitation and reclamation plan. The leaseholders must obtain all statutory clearances before any mining operations commence. The Chief Secretary of the State shall have supervisory control over the matter.

The court has denied permission to existing mining operators to carry out any mining activities on the basis of earlier licenses and has asked them to participate in the auction for the designated area in Faridabad. The permission for mining activities in the 1500 ha. of land in Gurgaon and Mewat will be taken up separately. The court may consider closure of the mining activities if there is any violation of the directions or failure of the rehabilitation and reclamation process to make satisfactory progress.

In addition to the above, the State must establish an Aravali Rehabilitation Fund and a Monitoring Committee. The Rehabilitation Fund will be used for the restoration of the degraded areas and the Monitoring Committee will oversee the implementation of the Reclamation and Rehabilitation Plan. 

The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The mining activities have caused extensive damage to the environment, and the court has taken a strong stance against it. The order is a step towards ensuring that the mining activities are carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner. 

All applications for intervention and impleadment have been disposed of. The court order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development in the Aravalli Hill Range in Haryana. The State of Haryana must take immediate steps to implement the order and establish guidelines and procedures for granting licenses/leases for mining minor minerals in a designated area of 600 hectares in Faridabad. The Rehabilitation Fund and the Monitoring Committee must also be established to oversee the implementation of the Reclamation and Rehabilitation Plan. The court may consider closure of the mining activities if there is any violation of the directions or failure of the rehabilitation and reclamation process to make satisfactory progress.
