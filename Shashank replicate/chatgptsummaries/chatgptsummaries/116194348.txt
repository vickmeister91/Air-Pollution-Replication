The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by two individuals against the State of Chhattisgarh and others. The petitioners' vehicle was found to be involved in an offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and was seized by forest authorities. The authorities initiated proceedings for confiscation of the vehicle, which was subsequently confiscated. The petitioners challenged the order of confiscation, arguing that it was without jurisdiction and authority of law. The court considered relevant provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The court order states that no one can damage or remove the habitat of any wild animal in a National Park without a permit from the Chief Wild Life Warden, and such a permit can only be granted if the State Government is satisfied that it is necessary for the improvement and management of wildlife. The order also states that any wild animal hunted or killed in contravention of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, or any article derived from such an animal, shall be the property of the State Government. The order further explains that the property seized under the Act cannot become the property of the State Government unless there is a finding by the competent court that the property was used for committing an offense under the Act. 

The court order quashes an order of confiscation of a vehicle by the Authorized Forest Officer without awaiting the decision of the competent criminal court about the use of the offending vehicle in an offense. The order grants the petitioners the liberty to make an application before the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offense for the interim custody of the vehicle. The court order requires the production of a certified copy of the order, with no costs awarded. The Authorized Forest Officer is allowed to proceed with the seizure or confiscation of the vehicle depending on the outcome of a pending criminal case. The order also states that a vehicle seized under the Wild Life (Protection) Act cannot be considered government property unless a criminal court finds that it was used to commit an offense.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and their habitats.
