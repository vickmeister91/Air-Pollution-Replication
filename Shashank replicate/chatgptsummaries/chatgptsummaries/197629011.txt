In a recent court order, the State of Haryana and another party were appealing against a suit for permanent injunction filed by Harbans Singh and others. The respondents claimed ownership of land and sought to prevent the appellants from cutting and removing trees on the land. The court found that the respondents were the owners of the land and that the appellants had no right to cut the trees without prior approval from the government. The appeal was dismissed, and the parties were left to bear their own costs.

The case at hand involved a dispute over land ownership and the right to cut trees on the land. The respondents, Harbans Singh and others, claimed ownership of the land and sought to prevent the appellants, the State of Haryana and another party, from cutting and removing trees on the land. The appellants argued that they had the right to cut the trees as they were carrying out development work on the land.

The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and found that the respondents were indeed the owners of the land. The court also noted that the appellants had not obtained prior approval from the government to cut the trees, which was required under the law. As a result, the court held that the appellants had no right to cut the trees without prior approval from the government.

The court's decision to dismiss the appeal and uphold the suit for permanent injunction filed by the respondents has significant implications for landowners and developers in the state of Haryana. It reinforces the importance of obtaining prior approval from the government before carrying out any development work on land, particularly when it involves cutting trees.

The court's decision also highlights the need for clear and transparent procedures for obtaining such approvals. Developers and landowners must ensure that they follow the correct procedures and obtain all necessary approvals before carrying out any development work on land.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of respecting property rights and following due process when carrying out development work on land. It also underscores the need for clear and transparent procedures for obtaining approvals from the government.
