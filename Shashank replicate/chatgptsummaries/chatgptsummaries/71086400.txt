The first court order pertains to the termination of a driver for a school bus. The petitioner, Lancer's Convent Senior Secondary School, had terminated the respondent's services on the grounds that the Supreme Court judgment and a notification issued by the Directorate of Education prohibited the appointment of a driver charged with certain offenses. The respondent had been absent without leave and was asked to submit a medical fitness certificate upon his return. He then disclosed that he had been facing trial for a criminal case and had been convicted and sent to jail. The respondent raised an industrial dispute, alleging illegal termination without an inquiry. The Labour Court held the termination to be illegal as no notice or inquiry was given. The petitioner challenged this court order.

The second court order discusses the same case and provides more details. The employee argued that his termination was illegal and unjustified because he had not been given notice or an inquiry. The court found in favor of the employee, stating that the termination was illegal and ordered the employee to be reinstated with full back wages. The court also discussed the law regarding termination on the grounds of loss of confidence and compensation in lieu of reinstatement.

The third court order discusses various cases where termination on the ground of loss of confidence was upheld. The court emphasizes that loss of confidence cannot be subjective and must rest on objective tangible facts leading to a definite apprehension in the mind of the management regarding the trustworthiness or reliability of the employee. The court also states that if the employer has lost confidence in the employee and the bona fide loss of confidence is affirmed, the order of discharge must be considered immune from challenge. In this case, the court concludes that the respondents were justified in terminating the driver's services on the ground of loss of confidence without an inquiry.

The fourth court order states that demand for illegal gratification by an employee to the detriment of the employer's interest can lead to loss of confidence and justify termination of employment. The court also notes that the procedure for justifying termination or any penalty imposed by an employer on an employee has emerged from judicial pronouncements and not specific provisions under labor laws. In this case, the court finds that the employer was justified in terminating the employee on the grounds of loss of confidence due to his involvement in a case of rash and negligent driving. The court allows the writ petition, sets aside the impugned award, and dismisses the respondent's claim. The petitioner is directed to refund the back wages to the respondent within eight weeks.
