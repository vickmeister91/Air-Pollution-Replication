The court has recently issued several orders related to the protection of wildlife and the safety of humans in areas where wild animals roam. One of the orders pertains to a case where a petitioner challenged the order issued by the respondent under Section 11(1) of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which permitted the shoot-at-sight of a problem tigress and the capture of her two cubs. The petitioner argued that the respondents had more than seven months to tranquilize or capture the tigress and that the order was unsustainable. The court heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision based on the evidence presented.

Another court order discussed a petition regarding the guidelines for declaring big cats as 'man-eaters'. The guidelines require the constitution of a team for technical guidance and monitoring, setting up of camera traps and pug mark impression pads, and cautioning inhabitants in the area. The order then discussed three incidents of tiger attacks and the measures taken by the field monitoring team. The Chief Wildlife Warden identified the tigress and cubs sighted in Compartment No. 155 as the ones involved in the human killing. The order commented on the three incidents occurring within a span of 24 days.

In another case, the court discussed a committee's investigation into three incidents of human killings by a tigress named T-1. The committee concluded that T-1 was responsible for all three killings and declared her a man-eater. The Chief Wildlife Warden ordered for T-1 to be tranquilized and captured, but if unsuccessful, to be eliminated by shooting to prevent further loss of human life. The court found no dispute with the material looked into and the bonafides of the Chief Wildlife Warden, but the contention was that other steps/measures stipulated in the SOP ought to have been considered. The court ultimately upheld the Chief Wildlife Warden's decision.

The court also discussed the steps to be taken after the loss of human life due to a problem tiger. The order states that the options listed in the standard operating procedure are not exhaustive but inclusive. The Chief Wildlife Warden's subjective satisfaction is important in determining the presence of a problem tiger. The court found no jurisdictional error or perversity in the order and dismissed the writ petition and civil application. The request to maintain status quo for a further period of seven days was rejected.

In all of these cases, the court has been tasked with balancing the need to protect wildlife with the need to ensure the safety of humans. The court has recognized that the guidelines and standard operating procedures in place are not exhaustive and that the Chief Wildlife Warden's subjective satisfaction is important in determining the presence of a problem tiger. However, the court has also emphasized the need to consider all available measures before resorting to extreme measures such as shooting at sight. The court's decisions in these cases will have a significant impact on the way wildlife is protected and managed in India.
