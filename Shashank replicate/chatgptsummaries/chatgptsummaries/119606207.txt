The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Deepak Kumar Tebriwal, who was facing arrest in connection with a case related to running a stone crusher without a No Objection Certificate from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The court directed that Tebriwal shall be released on bail on furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the like amount each, subject to conditions as laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The case against Tebriwal was initiated after the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board found that he was running a stone crusher without obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate. The Board had issued a show-cause notice to Tebriwal, asking him to explain why action should not be taken against him for violating the pollution control norms. However, Tebriwal failed to respond to the notice, following which the Board filed a complaint against him.

The complaint was registered under Section 15(1) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which provides for punishment for contravention of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine which may extend to one lakh rupees, or with both.

Tebriwal approached the Jharkhand High Court seeking anticipatory bail, apprehending arrest in connection with the case. The court heard the arguments of both the parties and observed that the offence alleged against Tebriwal was bailable in nature. The court also noted that Tebriwal had no criminal antecedents and was willing to cooperate with the investigation.

The court, therefore, granted anticipatory bail to Tebriwal on the condition that he shall furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the like amount each. The court also imposed certain conditions on Tebriwal, as laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. These conditions include that Tebriwal shall make himself available for interrogation by the investigating officer as and when required, shall not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses, and shall not commit any similar offence while on bail.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Tebriwal by the Jharkhand High Court is significant as it provides relief to Tebriwal from the fear of arrest in connection with the case. The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate from the pollution control authorities before starting any industrial activity, as failure to do so can lead to legal consequences.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Deepak Kumar Tebriwal in connection with a case related to running a stone crusher without a No Objection Certificate from the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board is a significant development in the case. The court's decision provides relief to Tebriwal from the fear of arrest and highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate from the pollution control authorities before starting any industrial activity.
