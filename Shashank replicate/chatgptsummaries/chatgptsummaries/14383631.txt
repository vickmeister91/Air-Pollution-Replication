The Punjab-Haryana High Court has recently issued a writ of mandamus to the respondent-authorities to close and remove an industrial unit that was manufacturing fan canopies in an area reserved for residential purposes. The court found that the unit was in violation of various acts and directed the respondent No.9 to consider and deal with the petitioner's representation within three months.

The case was brought before the court by a petitioner who argued that the industrial unit was causing pollution and noise in the residential area. The petitioner also claimed that the unit was operating without the necessary permissions and clearances from the authorities.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court found that the industrial unit was indeed in violation of various acts, including the Punjab Regional and Town Planning and Development Act, 1995, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the area where the unit was located was reserved for residential purposes and that the unit was causing a nuisance to the residents.

In light of these findings, the court issued a writ of mandamus to the respondent-authorities to close and remove the industrial unit. The court also directed the respondent No.9 to consider and deal with the petitioner's representation within three months and pass a comprehensive order in accordance with the law after affording notice and opportunity of hearing to all stakeholders.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of adhering to the laws and regulations governing land use and pollution control. The court's decision also underscores the need for authorities to take action against violators of these laws to protect the health and well-being of residents.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all stakeholders, including industrial units and authorities, to comply with the laws and regulations governing land use and pollution control. Failure to do so can result in legal action and penalties, as demonstrated in this case.
