The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by M.G. Aliyas seeking to quash an FIR registered against him by the Range Forest Officer for alleged violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner argued that the registration of the FIR was opposed to the provisions of Section 55 of the Act. The court held that while the provision bars cognizance and not the institution of the case, only authorized persons could initiate action for violation of the provisions of the Act by making a complaint under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. and not by lodging a report to the police. Therefore, the court allowed the petition and quashed the FIR, reserving liberty to authorized officers under the Act to file necessary complaints in accordance with Section 55 of the Act and proceed in the matter in accordance with the law.
