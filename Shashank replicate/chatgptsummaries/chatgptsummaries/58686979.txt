The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Ramdevbhai Samatbhai Sanjva against the State of Gujarat and six others. The petitioner had approached the court seeking relief against the respondents for their alleged failure to take action against illegal mining activities in the state. The petitioner had contended that the illegal mining activities were causing irreparable damage to the environment and the health of the people living in the affected areas.

In response to the writ petition, the respondent No. 7 submitted an affidavit stating that the National Green Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi was already seized with the subject matter of the writ petition. The respondent argued that the petitioner's remedy lay before the National Green Tribunal and not before the High Court.

The petitioner's counsel, however, relied on a previous decision of the court to transfer the pending writ petition to the National Green Tribunal. The counsel argued that the National Green Tribunal had the expertise and the jurisdiction to deal with environmental matters and that the transfer of the writ petition would ensure a speedy and effective resolution of the dispute.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court directed the registry to transfer the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal Bench where the main application was pending. The court observed that the National Green Tribunal was the appropriate forum to deal with environmental matters and that the transfer of the writ petition would avoid any duplication of proceedings and ensure a speedy and effective resolution of the dispute.

The court's decision to transfer the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal is significant as it underscores the importance of specialized forums in dealing with complex and technical matters such as environmental disputes. The National Green Tribunal was established in 2010 as a specialized forum to deal with environmental disputes and has since emerged as a key institution in the country's environmental governance framework.

The court's decision also highlights the need for effective coordination between different forums and institutions in the country's legal system. The transfer of the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal ensures that the matter is dealt with by the appropriate forum and avoids any duplication of proceedings. This, in turn, ensures a speedy and effective resolution of the dispute, which is in the interest of all parties involved.

In conclusion, the court's decision to transfer the writ petition to the National Green Tribunal is a welcome development in the country's environmental governance framework. It underscores the importance of specialized forums in dealing with complex and technical matters such as environmental disputes and highlights the need for effective coordination between different forums and institutions in the country's legal system.
