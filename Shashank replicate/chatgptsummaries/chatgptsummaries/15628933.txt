The court has recently issued orders in three separate cases related to alleged defamatory statements made against individuals and companies. The first case pertains to multiple criminal petitions filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to quash proceedings related to alleged defamatory statements made in a weekly magazine. The accused parties include mining companies and individuals, and the complainants allege that the statements were made at their behest and are false. The court considered all the petitions together and reserved its orders.

In the second case, a complaint was filed against several individuals for allegedly publishing a defamatory article that caused damage to the reputation of the complainant. The court denies allegations of encroachment of mines and violation of interstate borders and states that the matter is subjudice. The court also questions the validity of the complaint and the allegations made against the accused. The court considers quashing the proceedings against the accused based on lack of evidence and the possibility of malicious intent.

The third case discusses a case where the petitioners were accused of making defamatory statements against the complainants. The court found that there were no statements attributed to the petitioners that could be considered defamatory, and that the court below was not justified in issuing process against them. The court also noted that pending criminal proceedings can cause inconvenience and hardship for businessmen who need to travel abroad. Therefore, the court allowed the petition and quashed the complaint against the petitioners.
