In a recent case, the petitioner had requested certain documents under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to confront the credibility of witnesses in a bribery case against her. The trial court had dismissed the petition, but the High Court has directed that if the prosecution witnesses speak about any fact in connection with records maintained by the police station, those records must be furnished to the accused. This direction applies only to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial.

The case in question involves a bribery charge against the petitioner, who has requested certain documents to confront the credibility of witnesses in the case. The trial court had dismissed the petitioner's request, but the High Court has now directed that if prosecution witnesses speak about any fact in connection with records maintained by the police station, those records must be furnished to the accused.

The High Court's direction applies only to police personnel attached to the Kannan kurichi police station in Salem who are examined by the prosecution during the trial. This means that if any police personnel attached to this police station are called as witnesses by the prosecution, and they speak about any fact in connection with records maintained by the police station, those records must be furnished to the accused.

The High Court's direction is based on Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that all relevant evidence is available to the parties in a criminal trial, so that they can make their case effectively.
