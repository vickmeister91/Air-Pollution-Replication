The University of Agriculture and an ex-Vice Chancellor filed petitions to quash the order taking cognizance of the offense punishable under Section 55 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The Act was enacted to provide for conservation of biological diversity, sustainable use of its components, and equitable sharing of the benefits assigning out of the biological resources. The respondents alleged that the accused entered into a sub-license agreement to develop and deliver varieties of insect-tolerant bt-eggplant using biological resources without the approval of the National Biodiversity Authority.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by respondents alleging that the accused parties entered into agreements to develop and distribute genetically modified eggplants without proper approval. The petitioners challenge the validity of the complaint on various grounds, including that the complainants have no authority to file such a complaint and that the agreements were approved by higher authorities. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the validity of the complaint.

The court order states that the Act of 2002 does not apply to collaborative research projects under Section 5 of the Act, and therefore, there is no justification for filing a complaint for contravention of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. The complaint was filed by authorized officers who have the authority to file such complaints, and there is no bar for initiating complaints against non-public servants. The court also clarifies the capacity and authority of the complainants and states that the complaint has to be treated as a complaint by a public servant. The court also discusses the need for sanction to prosecute a public servant and refers to Section 27 of the Act of 2009 regarding the Vice-Chancellor's position.

The court order states that the Chancellor of a university has the authority to remove the Vice-Chancellor if it appears that their continuation is detrimental to the interest of the university. The Chancellor must hold an inquiry, and a person who is or has been a Judge of the High Court must be nominated to conduct the inquiry. The Vice-Chancellor and Registrar of the university cannot claim protection under Section 197 Cr.P.C. in the event of any charges under the Penal Provisions. The order also explains the meaning of "legal proceeding" under Section 64 of the Act of 2009 and how it applies to criminal proceedings. The court order also states that the intention of the Legislature is primarily to be gathered from the language used.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 64 of the Act of 2009, which provides protection to officers or universities for acts done in good faith. The court concludes that a criminal prosecution is included in the definition of "legal proceedings" under the Act, and that good faith can be a defense in criminal proceedings but cannot be used to quash proceedings. The order also discusses the ABSP-II Project and the transfer of transgenic brinjal varieties from accused No.5 to the petitioners' university for research and development purposes.

The court order pertains to a violation of Section 4 of the Act of 2002, which prohibits the transfer of biological resources occurring in or obtained from India for monetary consideration or otherwise to any person who is not a citizen of India or a non-resident citizen of India or a body corporate or organization which is not registered or incorporated in India or which has any non-Indian participation in its share capital or management. The court found that there was sufficient material on record for the violation of Section 4 of the Act of 2002. The court also clarified that the exemption under Section 40 of the Act of 2002 for eggplant or brinjal only applies to exports and not to the use of biological resources as a source for research or industrial purposes, which would require the previous approval of the National Biodiversity Authority.

The court order discusses the exemption of GMOs covered under the EPA 1986 from requiring previous approval for export, but clarifies that previous approval is required if the GMO is used for research or industrial purposes. The order also discusses the conditions for exemption from the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 2002 for collaborative research projects, which include conforming to policy guidelines issued by the Central Government and obtaining approval from the Central Government. The court finds that the petitioners did not comply with these conditions and therefore cannot seek exemption from the provisions of Section 4 of the Act of 2002. The court also finds that the petitioners violated Section 4 of the Act of 2002 by transferring biological resources without prior approval from the NBA. The petitions are dismissed.

In summary, the court order pertains to a complaint filed by respondents alleging that the accused parties entered into agreements to develop and distribute genetically modified eggplants without proper approval. The petitioners challenge the validity of the complaint on various grounds, including that the complainants have no authority to file such a complaint and that the agreements were approved by higher authorities. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision on the validity of the complaint.

The court order clarifies that the Act of 2002 does not apply to collaborative research projects under Section 5 of the Act, and therefore, there is no justification for filing a complaint for contravention of Sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
