The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to hazardous waste landfill sites and the construction of residential and commercial projects near them. In one case, a non-governmental organization brought a writ application in the nature of a Public Interest Litigation, arguing that the respondents had been granted permission to construct residential flats adjacent to a Hazardous Waste Landfill Site in violation of guidelines framed by the Central Pollution Control Board. The respondents argued that the petition was malafide and targeted only against their project, and that the petitioner had intentionally not raised any grievance against any other developments which are already in existence and are within the periphery of 500 meters of the Hazardous Waste Landfill Site. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioner and ordered the respondents to stop construction and not to sell any more units.

In another case, the court ordered the respondents to disconnect all unauthorized connections with municipal drains from industrial units and implement the National Productivity Council's recommendations for solid waste disposal within six months. Industrial units were restrained from disposing of solid waste in open plots of land designated for such purposes by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The court also outlined guidelines for the siting of a landfill, including a requirement that it be at least 500m from a habituated area and that a no-development buffer zone be established around it.

In yet another case, the court allowed the construction of housing projects within 500 meters of a landfill site, despite concerns about hazardous waste and pollution. The court considered the arguments of both the petitioner and respondents, including the fact that the landfill site was established before the housing projects were approved. The court also noted that the state government had issued guidelines for setting up hazardous waste management facilities, including a buffer zone of 500 meters around such sites. The court ordered that a buffer zone of 100 meters be maintained around existing landfill sites, and that a buffer zone of 500 meters be included in new development plans and town planning schemes.

The court also emphasized the importance of the right to a healthy life as a fundamental right and the basis for exercising other fundamental rights. The court recognized that health is not just the absence of sickness but a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. The court ordered the closure of borewells within 500 meters of a landfill site and the provision of potable water through pipelines. The court also directed the authorities to act in accordance with the decision taken in a meeting convened on September 5, 2011. The court concluded that the health of the people is of paramount importance and that the authorities cannot grant development permission ignoring the statutory restriction and the hard reality existing as on today.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following guidelines and regulations related to hazardous waste management and the siting of landfills. They also emphasize the need to prioritize the health and well-being of citizens when making decisions about development projects.
