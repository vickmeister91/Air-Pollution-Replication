The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where individuals or organizations challenged the grant of environmental clearance for various projects. In each case, the court had to determine whether the petitioner or appellant had the standing to file an appeal under the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act.

In the first case, the petitioner, Prafulla Samantra, challenged an order by the National Environmental Appellate Authority dismissing his appeal against the Ministry of Environment and Forests granting environmental clearance for an alumina smelter plant in Orissa. Samantra claimed to be a social and environmental activist and president of a social organization, Lok Shakti Abhiyan, and argued that the project violated forest and conservation laws. However, the court found that Samantra did not qualify as a "person aggrieved" under the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act and dismissed the appeal.

Similarly, in the second case, the appellant had filed an appeal against the grant of environmental clearance for a project. The court found that the appellant did not have the standing to file the appeal as he was not a "person aggrieved" under Section 11(2)(a) of the NEAA Act, 1997. The court rejected the appellant's claim that he was a social and environmental activist involved in the issues concerning the tribals as well as the environment. The court held that the appellant was not affected in any manner so as to satisfy the criteria laid down for "person aggrieved" in the judgment of Supreme Court. The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the interpretation of the Authority was contrary to the object of the Act.

However, in the third case, the court ruled that the petitioner did have standing to file an appeal against the grant of environmental clearance because he was a "person aggrieved" under Section 112(a) of the Act. The court interpreted the Act as a beneficial statute that should be given a purposive construction to further legislative intention. The court emphasized the importance of access to justice for communities that may be affected by a project or scheme, even if they do not have an association of persons working in the field of environment. The court rejected the respondent's interpretation of the Act, which would have limited the right to appeal to a narrow group of individuals and organizations.

Finally, in the fourth case, the court stated that the expression "person aggrieved" should be given a broad interpretation to include individuals and organizations interested in social and environmental causes. The court found that the petitioner, who represented an organization working for the betterment of the environment, had the right to appeal a decision related to the setting up of an aluminum smelter plant. The court emphasized the importance of allowing access to meaningful channels for communities that could be affected by proposed projects and quashed the impugned order of the Authority. The Authority was directed to entertain and dispose of the petitioner's appeal in accordance with the law.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of standing in environmental cases and the need to interpret the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act in a way that allows for meaningful access to justice for communities that may be affected by proposed projects. While some petitioners or appellants may not qualify as "persons aggrieved," the courts have recognized the importance of a broad interpretation of this term to ensure that those with a genuine interest in social and environmental causes have the ability to challenge decisions that may impact their communities.
