The recent court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies challenging the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners argued that the provision, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest without granting a hearing to affected parties, is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. The government, on the other hand, argued that the provision is necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. 

After hearing both sides, the court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the provision and dismissed the writ petitions. The court held that the provision is not violative of the Constitution and is necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period. The court also observed that the provision does not deprive the affected parties of their right to be heard, as they can approach the government for a hearing before the final notification is issued.

The court order also discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

In one case, the court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court observed that the State Government has the power to declare an area as a protected forest under Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, and such declaration is necessary to protect the environment and ecology.

The court also dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs. The court observed that the petitioners have failed to establish that the provision is violative of the Constitution and that the government has the power to declare an area as a protected forest under Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953.

In conclusion, the recent court order upholding the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is a significant development in the ongoing debate over the protection of forest land and waste land. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle is a welcome move towards protecting the environment and ecology. The court's decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court is also a positive step towards preventing devastation of the environment and wildlife. Overall, the court's order is a reminder of the importance of protecting the environment and ecology for the present and future generations.
