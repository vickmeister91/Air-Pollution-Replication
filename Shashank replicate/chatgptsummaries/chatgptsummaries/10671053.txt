The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against M/s Nicosulf Industries & Export Pvt. Ltd. and its co-directors for discharging polluted water without prior permission or approval. The lower court had convicted the accused, but the Gujarat High Court allowed the revision petition filed by the respondents on the ground that the complainant had no authority to file the complaint. The Supreme Court of India heard the appeal and held that the delegation of the power of sanctioning prosecution in favor of the Chairman was valid and effective, even for the purpose of amended Section 49(1)(a) of the Act. The Court also noted that the prosecution was required to prove that the solar evaporation pan maintained by the company had overflown and the overflown effluent did not conform to the tolerance limits prescribed.

The second court order discusses a case where a company was accused of discharging effluent into a drain leading to a solar evaporation pan. The court found that there was no evidence that the sample taken was of the overflown effluent, and therefore, the alleged breach of condition No.4 was not proved. The court also discussed the authorization process for filing a complaint and concluded that the appeal should be dismissed.
