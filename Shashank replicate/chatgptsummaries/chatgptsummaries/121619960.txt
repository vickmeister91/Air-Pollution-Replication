The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) by the petitioner, who was aggrieved by an order passed by the II Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sidhi, District Sidhi. The order in question was passed in Criminal Revision No. 87/2018, which arose out of an order dated 28.05.2018 passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Churhat, District Sidhi in Crime No. 92/2018.

The petitioner had filed an application under Section 457 of the CrPC for "Supurdginama" of a seized vehicle, specifically a Dumper bearing No. M.P. 53 G.A. 2191. However, the application was rejected by the JMFC, Churhat, District Sidhi vide order dated 28.05.2018. The order of rejection was subsequently affirmed by the ASJ, District Sidhi vide order dated 09.06.2018.

The petitioner was not satisfied with the orders passed by the lower courts and hence filed the present petition under Section 482 of the CrPC. The petitioner sought relief in the form of directions to be given to the lower courts to allow the petitioner to take possession of the seized vehicle on "Supurdginama" subject to certain conditions.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and directed that the vehicle/Dumper bearing No. M.P. 53 G.A. 2191 be given to the petitioner on "Supurdginama" subject to certain conditions. The court also directed the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that the vehicle would not be used for any illegal activities and that it would be produced before the court whenever required.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had a legitimate claim to the seized vehicle and that the lower courts had erred in rejecting the petitioner's application for "Supurdginama". The court also took into account the fact that the petitioner had given an undertaking that the vehicle would not be used for any illegal activities and that it would be produced before the court whenever required.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that the rights of all parties involved are protected. The court's decision to allow the petitioner to take possession of the seized vehicle on "Supurdginama" subject to certain conditions is a fair and just outcome that takes into account the interests of both parties involved.
