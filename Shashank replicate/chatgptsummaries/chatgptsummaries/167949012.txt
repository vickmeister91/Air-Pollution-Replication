The court order in question pertains to a review petition filed by Girwai Laghu Udyog Sanchalak Kalyanari Sangh seeking a review of an earlier order that dismissed their writ petition seeking direction against the authorities to permit them to work properly and for quashing of notification issued under Section 18 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner raised three grounds, but the court found no mistake or error apparent on the face of the record and dismissed the review petition.

The petitioner, Girwai Laghu Udyog Sanchalak Kalyanari Sangh, had filed a writ petition seeking direction against the authorities to permit them to work properly and for quashing of notification issued under Section 18 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The writ petition was dismissed by the court, prompting the petitioner to file a review petition.

The review petition raised three grounds, namely that the court had failed to consider the fact that the petitioner was engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling of bamboo and that the notification issued under Section 18 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 had severely impacted their business. The petitioner also argued that the notification was arbitrary and violative of their fundamental rights. Finally, the petitioner contended that the court had failed to consider the fact that the petitioner had obtained all necessary permissions and licenses to carry out their business.

However, the court found no mistake or error apparent on the face of the record and dismissed the review petition. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any new material or evidence that would warrant a review of the earlier order. The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the notification issued under Section 18 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 in their writ petition and therefore could not raise the same issue in their review petition.

The court further noted that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate how the notification had impacted their business and had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the notification was arbitrary and violative of their fundamental rights. The court also observed that the petitioner had not challenged the validity of the permissions and licenses obtained by them in their writ petition and therefore could not raise the same issue in their review petition.

In conclusion, the court found no merit in the review petition and dismissed the same. The court reiterated that a review petition is not an appeal in disguise and that the petitioner must provide new material or evidence that would warrant a review of the earlier order. The court also emphasized that a review petition cannot be used to re-argue the same issues that were raised and decided in the earlier order.
