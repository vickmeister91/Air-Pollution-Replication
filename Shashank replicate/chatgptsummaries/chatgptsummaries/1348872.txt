In a recent court order, Meera Kapoor and others sought the quashing of a Kalandara under Section 175 IPC registered against them. The Kalandara alleged that the accused had ignored notices under Sections 160 and 91 CrPC and were withholding information, thereby committing an offence under Section 175 IPC. However, the court found that the Kalandara did not even prima facie indicate that an offence under Section 175 IPC was committed by any of the petitioners. Therefore, the court quashed the Kalandara and all proceedings consequent thereto, including the summoning order passed by the learned MM.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Kalandara did not provide any evidence to support the allegations made against the petitioners. The court found that the Kalandara was vague and did not provide any specific details about the alleged offence. The court also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had provided all the information that was required of them. Therefore, the court concluded that there was no basis for the Kalandara and all proceedings consequent thereto to continue.

In addition to quashing the Kalandara and all proceedings consequent thereto, the court also required a copy of the court order to be provided. This requirement is standard practice in court proceedings and ensures that all parties involved are aware of the court's decision. The provision of a copy of the court order also allows the parties to take any necessary action in response to the court's decision.

Overall, the court's decision to quash the Kalandara and all proceedings consequent thereto was based on the lack of evidence to support the allegations made against the petitioners. The court found that the Kalandara was vague and did not provide any specific details about the alleged offence. The court also noted that the petitioners had cooperated with the investigation and had provided all the information that was required of them. Therefore, the court concluded that there was no basis for the Kalandara and all proceedings consequent thereto to continue. The requirement for a copy of the court order to be provided is standard practice in court proceedings and ensures that all parties involved are aware of the court's decision.
