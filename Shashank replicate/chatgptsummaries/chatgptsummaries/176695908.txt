The National Green Tribunal (NGT) received an application from J. Mehta against various government bodies and private companies, including Ambience Developers, Bird Automotive, Home Centre, Reliance Trends, Lifestyle, Big Bazar, Parcos, Kiehl's, and Shoppers Stop. The applicant claimed that the Environmental Clearance (EC) granted to Ambience Mall was violated, and the respondent companies were responsible for various environmental violations. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued an order on October 24, 2013.

The court order pertains to a case where a company sought clearance under environmental laws to construct a building. The company submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report to obtain the clearance, which included details of the building's size and layout. The clearance was granted with specific conditions, including the installation of a sewage treatment plant and periodic monitoring of pollution levels. However, the company was found to have made unauthorized changes to the building's layout, including using areas meant for parking for commercial purposes. Several parties were found to be operating shops in non-permissible areas, which violated the conditions of the clearance and posed a hazard to the environment.

The court order discusses a case where Respondent No.9 has violated the conditions of the Environmental Clearance (EC) and sanctioned plans, leading to hazardous environmental conditions. The applicant claims that the changes in construction have drastically affected safety norms and public health. Respondent No.9 argues that they have not breached the EC or EIA Report and are entitled to additional Floor Area Ratio (FAR). The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has filed a detailed reply-affidavit stating that any additional FAR cannot be allowed on already built-up and approved plots unless a policy is formulated and approved. The court has conducted inspections and found that there is misuse of the premises, and Respondent No.9 has requested additional FAR as per Master Plan Delhi (MPD) 2021.

The court order discusses the misuse of space meant for parking at a mall in Delhi, including unauthorized constructions and unapproved use of basements for commercial purposes. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee and other authorities have found deficiencies in the mall's operations, including the excessive use of underground water without permission. The court has also noted violations of building permission rules and environmental impact assessment conditions. The order includes observations from a joint inspection team and responses from various government departments.

The court order discusses an inspection of a property occupied by Big Bazar Family Center and Big Bazar, where commercial activities were found to be carried out in areas meant for parking. The court must determine if the application is maintainable and if Respondent No.9 has violated any laws related to the environment. The NGT Act gives the Tribunal wide jurisdiction to deal with civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The right to appeal is available to any person aggrieved. The court refers to a recent judgment of the Tribunal in the case of Goa Foundation v. Union of India to analyze the interpretation and impact of relevant provisions and the scheme of the NGT Act.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and purpose of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, which was enacted to provide for the establishment of a tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court emphasizes the importance of the preamble of the NGT Act in interpreting its provisions and outlines the jurisdiction of the tribunal, which includes hearing disputes relating to environmental protection and conservation, enforcement of legal rights relating to the environment, and awarding relief and compensation for damages to persons and property. The court also examines the case made by the applicant in their application and the essential features of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Report that formed the basis for the grant of Environmental Clearance (EC) to the project proponent.

The court order discusses the process of obtaining environmental clearance (EC) for building and construction projects. The Expert Appraisal Committee or State level Appraisal Committee determines the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the project, and the project proponent submits an EIA Report in response. The Expert Appraisal Committee then makes recommendations for acceptance or rejection of the proposal, and the competent authority grants the EC. The court emphasizes that the EC covers all facets of the project, including construction, utilization of space, user of space, provision of services, sewage treatment, etc. Any change in these aspects would require a fresh appraisal by the competent authority. The court also notes that the FAR, construction, and user of space are essential considerations for EC, and any alteration in these facets would require fresh EC/appraisal. The court rejects the argument of Respondent No.9 that there was a change in the FAR from 100 to 125 in the MPD 2021, and that they were entitled to use the increased FAR in the basement, other parking, and service areas for commercial purposes. The court notes that the DDA has not granted any permission for change in use, and other public authorities have not granted fire clearance, permission for commercial use, or consent for extraction of underground water. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has also stated that the alleged use of basement and multi-level block for commercial operations is in violation of building guidelines and an absolute breach of the EC granted to the project proponent.

The court order approves the extraction of underground water due to increased capacity and utilization. The MoEF has
