The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that was filed as a public interest litigation regarding pollution caused by a hot mix plant in a village. The court, however, dismissed the petition and advised the petitioner to seek alternative remedy before the Western Bench of National Green Tribunal.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of pollution caused by the hot mix plant. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided any scientific data or expert opinion to support their claims, and that their allegations were based solely on hearsay and conjecture.

In light of this, the court concluded that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for relief and that their petition was therefore liable to be dismissed. The court also advised the petitioner to seek alternative remedy before the Western Bench of National Green Tribunal, which is a specialized court that deals with environmental issues.

The court's order also included routine questions regarding the judgment and appearance of lawyers. These questions were aimed at ensuring that the court's decision was properly recorded and that all parties involved in the case were given a fair opportunity to present their arguments.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the petition highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of environmental pollution. While public interest litigations can be an effective tool for addressing environmental issues, they must be based on solid evidence and expert opinion in order to be successful.

Furthermore, the court's advice to seek alternative remedy before the National Green Tribunal underscores the importance of specialized courts in addressing complex environmental issues. By directing the petitioner to seek relief before the Western Bench of National Green Tribunal, the court ensured that the case would be heard by a court with the necessary expertise and resources to address the environmental concerns at hand.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of evidence-based decision making in environmental litigation, as well as the role of specialized courts in addressing complex environmental issues.
