In a recent court order, the Honorary Secretary and Salesman of a fair price shop were acquitted of charges under the Essential Commodities Act. The case was based on a complaint filed by the Marketing Officer, but the petitioners argued that the Marketing Officer was not authorized to file the complaint as required by the Act. The court found that the Marketing Officer was not duly authorized and quashed the order of cognizance and the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners.

The court relied on previous rulings that held that a complaint filed by a person who is not duly authorized is not a valid complaint in law. This ruling is significant as it reinforces the importance of following due process and ensuring that complaints are filed by authorized individuals.

The Essential Commodities Act is a law that regulates the production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities such as food, drugs, and fuel. The Act empowers the government to regulate the prices of essential commodities and take action against hoarding and black marketing.

In this case, the Honorary Secretary and Salesman of a fair price shop were accused of committing an offence under the Act. The Special Judge had taken cognizance of the offence based on a complaint filed by the Marketing Officer. However, the petitioners argued that the Marketing Officer was not authorized to file the complaint as required by the Act.

The court found that the Marketing Officer was not duly authorized to file the complaint. The Act requires that complaints be filed by authorized officers of the government or by individuals who have been authorized by the government. The court held that the Marketing Officer did not fall under either of these categories and therefore was not authorized to file the complaint.

The court relied on previous rulings that held that a complaint filed by a person who is not duly authorized is not a valid complaint in law. The court noted that the purpose of requiring authorized officers to file complaints is to ensure that complaints are filed by individuals who have the necessary knowledge and expertise to identify offences under the Act.

The court also noted that allowing unauthorized individuals to file complaints would lead to chaos and confusion. It would also undermine the authority of the government and the rule of law. Therefore, the court held that the complaint filed by the Marketing Officer was not valid and quashed the order of cognizance and the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners.

This ruling is significant as it reinforces the importance of following due process and ensuring that complaints are filed by authorized individuals. It also highlights the need for individuals to be aware of the requirements of the law and to ensure that they are following the correct procedures when filing complaints.

In conclusion, the recent court order acquitting the Honorary Secretary and Salesman of a fair price shop of charges under the Essential Commodities Act is a significant ruling that reinforces the importance of following due process and ensuring that complaints are filed by authorized individuals. The court's reliance on previous rulings that held that a complaint filed by a person who is not duly authorized is not a valid complaint in law highlights the need for individuals to be aware of the requirements of the law and to ensure that they are following the correct procedures when filing complaints.
