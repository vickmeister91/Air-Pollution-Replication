The Madras High Court recently received a writ petition from M/S.Aspinwall & Company Ltd against the Sub-Divisional Magistrate and Sub Collector of Pollachi, Coimbatore District, Tamilnadu. The petitioner requested a Writ of Certiorari to quash the impugned order in Na.Ka.No.78/2018/A1, dated 10.01.2018, and allow the petitioner to carry out normal manufacturing activities in the factory. The court heard arguments from both parties and ordered that a certificate must be produced from the Pollution Control Board as a pre-condition for the continuity of the manufacturing activities of the petitioner company.
