The Karnataka High Court has recently issued two court orders related to quarrying leases and the Forest Conservation Act. The first court order lists four writ petitions filed by different individuals and companies against the State of Karnataka and various government officials. The petitions seek to quash communications and letters issued by the respondents related to the renewal of quarrying leases without requiring permission under the Forest Conservation Act. However, the court has not provided a decision or ruling in this order.

The second court order pertains to a petition filed by quarrying lease applicants seeking to quash orders requiring them to obtain permission from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act for quarrying on lands that may be classified as forest land. The court has relied on an affidavit by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Hassan Circle, which states that the lands in question have characteristics of forest land and that a survey is required to determine the extent of forest land. The court has directed the respondents to examine the cases of the petitioners after the survey is completed and to communicate the result of the examination within six months. However, the court has not expressed any opinion on whether the lands in question are forest lands requiring clearance or prior approval of the Central Government.

The issue at hand in both court orders is the renewal and granting of quarrying leases without obtaining permission under the Forest Conservation Act. The Act requires prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity on forest land. The Act defines forest land as any land that is recorded as forest in government records, regardless of the ownership or classification of the land. The Act also includes any land that is not recorded as forest but has characteristics of forest land, such as dense tree cover, wildlife habitat, and ecological significance.

The first court order lists four writ petitions filed by different individuals and companies against the State of Karnataka and various government officials. The petitions seek to quash communications and letters issued by the respondents related to the renewal of quarrying leases without requiring permission under the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioners argue that the respondents have misinterpreted the Act and that quarrying leases do not require prior approval of the Central Government. The petitioners also argue that the respondents have not followed due process in renewing the leases and have not considered the environmental impact of quarrying on forest land.

The second court order pertains to a petition filed by quarrying lease applicants seeking to quash orders requiring them to obtain permission from the Central Government under the Forest Conservation Act for quarrying on lands that may be classified as forest land. The petitioners argue that the lands in question are not forest lands and that the respondents have not conducted a proper survey to determine the extent of forest land. The petitioners also argue that the respondents have not followed due process in requiring prior approval of the Central Government and have not considered the economic impact of delaying or denying quarrying leases.

The court has not provided a decision or ruling in the first court order, but it is likely that the court will consider the arguments of both parties and the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act before making a decision. The Act requires prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity on forest land, and it is possible that the court will interpret quarrying leases as non-forest activities that require prior approval. The court may also consider the environmental impact of quarrying on forest land and the due process followed by the respondents in renewing the leases.

In the second court order, the court has relied on an affidavit by the Chief Conservator of Forest, Hassan Circle, which states that the lands in question have characteristics of forest land and that a survey is required to determine the extent of forest land. The court has directed the respondents to examine the cases of the petitioners after the survey is completed and to communicate the result of the examination within six months. However, the court has not expressed any opinion on whether the lands in question are forest lands requiring clearance or prior approval of the Central Government.

In conclusion, the court orders related to quarrying leases and the Forest Conservation Act highlight the importance of following due process and obtaining prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity on forest land. The Act defines forest land broadly and includes any land that has characteristics of forest land, such as dense tree cover, wildlife habitat, and ecological significance. The court is likely to consider the arguments of both parties and the provisions of the Act before making a decision. It is important to balance the economic benefits of quarrying with the environmental impact on forest land and to follow due process in obtaining and renewing quarrying leases.
