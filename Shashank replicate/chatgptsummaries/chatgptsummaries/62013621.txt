The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Mumbai recently heard an appeal by Vinyl Chemicals (India) Ltd against a penalty imposed under section 271(1)(c) of the IT Act for the assessment year 2006-07. The company had claimed depreciation on certain assets at the same rate as in previous years, which had been accepted by the department. However, the department later disallowed the claim and imposed a penalty for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The tribunal found that there was no concealment of income and deleted the penalty. The decision cited previous cases where penalties were deleted in similar circumstances.

The court order cites several cases where it was held that the mere disallowance of expenses or deductions does not automatically lead to the imposition of a penalty for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The court found no merit in the action of the assessing officer for levying a penalty for part disallowance of claim of depreciation and allowed the appeal of the assessee. The order was pronounced on October 23, 2017.

The case of Vinyl Chemicals (India) Ltd is an important one as it highlights the need for assessing officers to exercise caution when imposing penalties for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The tribunal found that there was no concealment of income and that the company had acted in good faith when claiming depreciation on certain assets. The decision is in line with previous cases where penalties were deleted in similar circumstances.

The court order also highlights the importance of understanding the difference between disallowance of expenses or deductions and the imposition of a penalty for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The court found that the mere disallowance of the claim for depreciation did not automatically lead to the imposition of a penalty. The assessing officer must show that there was a deliberate attempt to conceal income or furnish inaccurate particulars of income.

The case of Vinyl Chemicals (India) Ltd is a reminder to taxpayers to ensure that they are claiming deductions and expenses correctly and in accordance with the law. It is also a reminder to assessing officers to exercise caution when imposing penalties for furnishing inaccurate particulars of income. The decision of the tribunal is a welcome one as it provides clarity on the issue and ensures that taxpayers are not unfairly penalized for honest mistakes.
