The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Shailashree Umamaheshwar Bhat against Dwaraka Souharda Credit Sahakari Limited. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the trial court rejecting an application filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner had claimed that certain documents were necessary to establish the defense of the accused in proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the court found that the trial judge had given valid reasons for not allowing the application and that the documents sought for were not necessary. Therefore, the court rejected the petition.

The case at hand involved a dispute between the petitioner and the respondent, Dwaraka Souharda Credit Sahakari Limited, over a cheque that had been dishonored. The petitioner had claimed that the cheque had been issued by the respondent in lieu of a loan that had been taken by the petitioner. However, the respondent had denied any such transaction and had claimed that the cheque had been issued as a security deposit for a loan that had been taken by the petitioner's husband.

In order to establish their defense, the petitioner had sought certain documents from the respondent under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the trial court had rejected the application on the grounds that the documents sought for were not necessary for the defense of the accused. The petitioner had then filed a criminal petition before the High Court seeking to set aside the order of the trial court.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the trial judge had given valid reasons for not allowing the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court noted that the documents sought for by the petitioner were not necessary for the defense of the accused and that the trial judge had correctly exercised his discretion in rejecting the application.

The court also observed that the petitioner had failed to establish any prima facie case in their favor and that the trial court had rightly proceeded with the trial. The court noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to support their claim that the cheque had been issued in lieu of a loan and that the respondent had denied any such transaction.

In light of these findings, the court rejected the petition filed by the petitioner and upheld the order passed by the trial court. The court also directed the trial court to proceed with the trial and dispose of the case expeditiously.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Shailashree Umamaheshwar Bhat against Dwaraka Souharda Credit Sahakari Limited. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the trial court rejecting an application filed under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the court found that the trial judge had given valid reasons for not allowing the application and that the documents sought for were not necessary. Therefore, the court rejected the petition and directed the trial court to proceed with the trial and dispose of the case expeditiously.
