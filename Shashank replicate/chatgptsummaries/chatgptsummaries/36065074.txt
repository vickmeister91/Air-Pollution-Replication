In a recent court case, Sandeep Gupta's application under Section 91 of the CrPC was rejected by the court in the complaint of Kanhiya Kamrani. This decision was also upheld by the Additional Sessions Judge. The court found no jurisdictional error in the impugned order and dismissed the petition under Section 482 of the CrPC.

Section 91 of the CrPC allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the CrPC. Sandeep Gupta had filed an application under this section in response to a complaint filed by Kanhiya Kamrani.

However, the court found that there was no jurisdictional error in the impugned order, which had rejected Sandeep Gupta's application. The court therefore dismissed the petition under Section 482 of the CrPC.

Section 482 of the CrPC allows a court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the court found that there was no abuse of process or injustice in the impugned order, and therefore dismissed the petition.

Overall, this court case highlights the importance of understanding the jurisdictional requirements of the CrPC when filing applications or complaints. It also emphasizes the need for careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case before making any legal arguments or claims.
