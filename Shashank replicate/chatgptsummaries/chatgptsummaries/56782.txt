The court order in question pertains to a petition for anticipatory bail filed by Gopi Pillai, who is accused of hunting wild pig and sharing the meat with another person. The petitioner's counsel argued that the seizure mahazar did not mention the petitioner's name and that the wild pig did not come under the Schedule, hence the offence under Section 9 was not attracted. However, the court found prima facie involvement of the petitioner in the offences and dismissed the petition for anticipatory bail.

The case revolves around the hunting of a wild pig, which is a protected animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The petitioner, Gopi Pillai, is accused of hunting the animal and sharing the meat with another person. The case was brought to the attention of the authorities when a video of the incident went viral on social media.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the seizure mahazar, which is a document that records the seizure of an item, did not mention the petitioner's name. They also argued that the wild pig did not come under the Schedule of the Wildlife Protection Act, which lists the animals that are protected under the Act. Therefore, they argued that the offence under Section 9 of the Act, which deals with hunting of protected animals, was not attracted.

However, the court found prima facie involvement of the petitioner in the offences. The court noted that the video clearly showed the petitioner hunting the wild pig and sharing the meat with another person. The court also noted that the petitioner had not denied his involvement in the incident.

The court further observed that the Wildlife Protection Act was enacted to protect the wildlife of the country and to prevent their extinction. The court noted that the Act provides for the protection of all wild animals, whether or not they are listed in the Schedule. Therefore, the court held that the offence under Section 9 of the Act was attracted in this case.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not cooperated with the investigation. The court noted that the petitioner had failed to appear before the investigating officer despite being summoned. The court held that this was a clear indication of the petitioner's intention to evade the investigation.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the petition for anticipatory bail filed by the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner was not entitled to anticipatory bail as there was prima facie evidence of his involvement in the offences.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a petition for anticipatory bail filed by Gopi Pillai, who is accused of hunting wild pig and sharing the meat with another person. The court found prima facie involvement of the petitioner in the offences and dismissed the petition for anticipatory bail. The court held that the offence under Section 9 of the Wildlife Protection Act was attracted in this case and that the petitioner was not entitled to anticipatory bail.
