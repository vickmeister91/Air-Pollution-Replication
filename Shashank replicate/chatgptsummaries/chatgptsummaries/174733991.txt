The Orissa High Court recently heard a case regarding the appointment of the Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner, Dr. Barada Kanta Mishra, had been recommended by a Search Committee for the position, but the Hon'ble Chief Minister rejected the panel without providing a reason. The court found that the Search Committee had followed a proper procedure and selected the petitioner based on merit, and therefore the rejection of the panel without a proper reason was unjustified. The court ordered the government to produce records to determine if a reason had been given for the rejection.

The court order discusses the selection process for the Chairman of the Orissa State Pollution Control Board. A Search Committee selected three candidates in order of merit, including the petitioner, Dr. Barada Kanta Mishra. However, the Hon'ble Chief Minister passed an order appointing none of the candidates without providing any reason for their unsuitability. The court cites a previous case to argue that while a person on the select panel has no vested right to be appointed, there must be a justifiable reason for declining to appoint them. As no reason was given in this case, the court quashes the order and remits the matter back to the Hon'ble Chief Minister for reconsideration.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following proper procedures and providing justifiable reasons for decisions. The Search Committee had followed a proper procedure in selecting the candidates, and the petitioner had been selected based on merit. The Hon'ble Chief Minister's rejection of the panel without providing a reason was therefore unjustified. The court's order for the government to produce records to determine if a reason had been given for the rejection is a reminder that transparency and accountability are essential in decision-making processes.

The court's citation of a previous case also emphasizes the importance of providing justifiable reasons for decisions. While a person on a select panel may not have a vested right to be appointed, there must be a valid reason for declining to appoint them. In this case, the Hon'ble Chief Minister's order appointing none of the candidates without providing any reason for their unsuitability was deemed unjustified by the court.

The court's decision to quash the order and remit the matter back to the Hon'ble Chief Minister for reconsideration is a reminder that decisions must be made based on proper procedures and justifiable reasons. The court's order for the government to produce records to determine if a reason had been given for the rejection is also a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and providing justifiable reasons for decisions. The court's order for the government to produce records to determine if a reason had been given for the rejection is a reminder of the importance of transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. The court's citation of a previous case also emphasizes the importance of providing justifiable reasons for decisions.
