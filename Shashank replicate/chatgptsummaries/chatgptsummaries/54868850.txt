The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Baijnath Dubey and another person seeking a rehearing on charges framed against them in a criminal case. The petitioners argued that the charges could not have been framed against them as the newspaper they claimed to be associated with was registered with the Registrar of Newspapers. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the information did not call for a rehearing on the framing of charges. The court also noted that the main allegations against the petitioners were related to robbery and that allowing a rehearing would be an exercise in futility. The petition was dismissed, and pending applications were disposed of.

The court order, dated February 6, 2013, and numbered Crl.M.C. 466/2013, was issued by Judge G.P. Mittal and consists of four pages. Unfortunately, no information is provided regarding the content of the order, leaving us with only the above summary to work with.

From the summary, it appears that the petitioners were seeking to have the charges against them dismissed on the grounds that their newspaper was registered with the Registrar of Newspapers. However, the court found that this information did not warrant a rehearing on the framing of charges. The court also noted that the main allegations against the petitioners were related to robbery, suggesting that the charges were serious and not easily dismissed.

It is unclear from the summary why the petitioners believed that their newspaper registration should have prevented charges from being framed against them. It is possible that they believed that their association with a registered newspaper provided them with some sort of legal protection or immunity. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain.

Overall, it seems that the court was not convinced by the petitioners' arguments and chose to dismiss their petition. The court's decision suggests that the charges against the petitioners were serious and warranted further investigation and prosecution. It is unclear from the summary whether the petitioners were ultimately found guilty or acquitted of the charges against them.
