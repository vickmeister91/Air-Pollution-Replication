The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to cases under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act. In the first case, the District Forest Officer and State of Tamil Nadu filed Civil Revision Petitions to set aside an order passed by the Additional District Judge, Fast Tract Court, Namakkal in I.A. No.804/2006 in unnumbered CMA of 2006, dated 30.12.2011. The delay ranges between 1030 to 1090 days. The subject lands were acquired by the Government as early as in the year 1955 and they were declared as Reserve Forest Lands. The Forest Settlement Officer excluded the lands of the claimants from the Reserve Forest Area without getting sanction/approval of the Government. The court allowed the Civil Revision Petitions and quashed the order of the learned District Judge dismissing the petition to condone the delay.

In the second case, the Settlement Officer assessed lands that were not occupied by third parties, leading to a delay in filing Civil Miscellaneous Appeals. The petitioners sought an opportunity to contest the case on merits, and the court considered the reasons for the delay in filing the appeals. The court found the reasons justifiable and permitted the petitioners to contest the remaining cases on merits by condoning the delay in filing the appeals. The court also noted that in 502 cases, the court below had condoned the delay, and the appeals were being heard. The court ordered that the petitioners be given an opportunity to contest the case on merits.

The third court order discusses a case where the Forest Settlement Officer received claims without any documentary evidence and passed orders in different names of claimants on different dates. The orders were belatedly handed over to the District Forest Officer, and some claim orders are yet to be received. The Forest Settlement Officer did not follow the procedure laid down in the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, and the District Forest Officer has been taking action for filing the appeal. The Government Pleader opined that appeals have to be prepared against each order of the Forest Settlement Officer, and the court has accepted the reasons assigned by the petitioners for condonation of delay in preferring the Civil Miscellaneous Appeals before the District Court.

In the fourth court order, the court dismissed a civil revision petition and held that Section 10(2) of the Act is not applicable as the appeal was filed by the District Forest Officer, not the claimant. The court also accepted the reasons given for condoning the delay in filing the appeal and emphasized the need to decide disputes on merits rather than technicalities. The court ordered that the delay in filing the appeals be condoned to enable the petitioners to prosecute them. The court also noted a subsequent event where the District Collector had sent a proposal to allot land to the landless poor in the same area as the case, but did not go into the merits of the order.

In the fifth court order, the delay in filing Civil Miscellaneous Appeals by the petitioners is to be condoned so that they can present their case before the court. The court accepts the explanation given by the petitioners for the delay and allows their petitions. The court also notes that the staff of the department had to verify voluminous records, which caused the delay. The court sets aside the impugned orders and allows all the Civil Revision Petitions. No costs are awarded.

In summary, these court orders pertain to cases under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, where the court has accepted the reasons given for condoning the delay in filing the appeals and emphasized the need to decide disputes on merits rather than technicalities. The court has ordered that the delay in filing the appeals be condoned to enable the petitioners to prosecute them. The court has also noted subsequent events in some cases but did not go into the merits of the order. Overall, the court has allowed the Civil Revision Petitions and quashed the orders of the lower courts dismissing the petitions to condone the delay.
