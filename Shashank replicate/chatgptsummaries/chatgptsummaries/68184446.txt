The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal by Satishbhai R Patil against the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) in a case involving the Narmada Clean Tech Limited (NCTL). Patil argued that the NCTL had no authority to collect samples or act as an adjudicating authority, and that the establishment of the NCTL was contrary to the law. The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed the evidence before making a decision.

The court order discusses a dispute between the appellant and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) regarding the collection of water samples. The appellant argues that the NCTL, which collected the samples, does not have the authority to do so. The appellant also disputes the allegations made by respondent No.3 and claims that there is a serious dispute regarding the collection of samples. The court refers to relevant sections of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court ultimately upholds the impugned judgment and order of the learned Single Judge, dismissing the appeal.

The court order pertains to the establishment and operation of industrial plants in air pollution control areas. No person can do so without the previous consent of the State Board. An application for consent must be made in the prescribed form and accompanied by the necessary fees. The State Board may make inquiries and grant or refuse consent within four months of receiving the application. Every person to whom consent is granted must comply with the conditions specified by the State Board. If there are disputes, they must be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996. The court also notes the existence of the NCTL, a monitoring committee for industrial effluent discharge, and its role in controlling the discharge of effluent by member units. The court recognizes the existence of respondent No.3 and its role in controlling industrial effluent discharge for the larger public interest.

The court order states that when there is a conflict between private and public interests, the court must prioritize public interest. The appellant violated norms related to effluent discharge and therefore is not entitled to any relief. The court found no error in the dismissal of the petition and the appeal is dismissed. No costs are awarded.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between Satishbhai R Patil and the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) regarding the authority of the Narmada Clean Tech Limited (NCTL) to collect samples and act as an adjudicating authority. The court reviewed the evidence and ultimately upheld the impugned judgment and order of the learned Single Judge, dismissing the appeal.
