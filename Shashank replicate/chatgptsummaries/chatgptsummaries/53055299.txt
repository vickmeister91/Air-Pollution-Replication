In a recent court order, Bankelala and Kamta Dahayat were granted bail after being accused of hunting a Blue Bull (Neel Gai) in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court found no probability of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence and allowed their bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The accused were directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one surety of the same amount and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This decision was made after considering various factors such as the nature of the offense, the evidence against the accused, and their past criminal record.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal without a valid permit. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, national parks, and wildlife sanctuaries to conserve and protect wildlife.

In this case, the accused were found to have violated the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act by hunting a Blue Bull. The Blue Bull, also known as the Nilgai, is a large antelope species found in the Indian subcontinent. It is listed as a protected species under the Wild Life Protection Act and hunting it is strictly prohibited.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found no probability of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence. This means that the accused are not likely to flee from justice or destroy any evidence related to the case.

Secondly, the court considered the nature of the offense and the evidence against the accused. While hunting a Blue Bull is a serious offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, the court found that the evidence against the accused was not strong enough to warrant their continued detention.

Finally, the court also took into account the past criminal record of the accused. If the accused had a history of committing similar offenses or had a criminal record, the court may have been less inclined to grant them bail.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Bankelala and Kamta Dahayat in the case of hunting a Blue Bull in violation of the Wild Life Protection Act was based on several factors. The court found no probability of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence and allowed their bail application under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The accused were directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one surety of the same amount and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This decision highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act in protecting wildlife and their habitats and ensuring that those who violate its provisions are held accountable for their actions.
