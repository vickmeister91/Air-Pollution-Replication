The Madras High Court has recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by R. Mohanasundaram against the Conservator of Forests and other forest officers. The petitioner had filed a criminal case against Gopi and five other forest offenders for hunting deer in a reserved forest area, and the case was pending trial. However, the forest officers issued a charge memo against the petitioner, alleging that he had filed a false case. The petitioner requested an independent agency to conduct an inquiry, but the request was rejected.

The court found that the forest officers had no authority to pre-judge the pending criminal case and had issued the charge memo with a malafide motive to help the accused. The court quashed the charge memo and imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 against the second respondent, District Forest Officer, Kallakurichi. The court has also ordered that the petitioner's retiral benefits be disbursed within four weeks.

The court has noted the repeated vindictive and motivated malafide attempts to prosecute the petitioner and has found the approach adopted by the respondent department to be fully unwarranted and uncalled for. The court has also found that the respondents cannot pre-judge the pending criminal case filed against the forest offenders before the competent criminal court gives its verdict.

The court has found that the department has falsely suspended the petitioner and attempted to interfere with a pending criminal case in favor of the accused. The charge memo issued against the petitioner is quashed, and a cost of Rs. 10,000 is imposed on the second respondent for vindictive and malicious prosecution. The petitioner's retiral benefits are to be disbursed within four weeks.

The court order is a significant victory for the petitioner, who had been facing repeated attempts to prosecute him maliciously. The court has found that the forest officers had no authority to pre-judge the pending criminal case and had issued the charge memo with a malafide motive to help the accused. The court has also noted the repeated vindictive and motivated malafide attempts to prosecute the petitioner and has found the approach adopted by the respondent department to be fully unwarranted and uncalled for.

The court has also found that the respondents cannot pre-judge the pending criminal case filed against the forest offenders before the competent criminal court gives its verdict. This is an important principle of justice, as it ensures that the accused are not given undue advantage by the authorities.

The court has imposed a cost of Rs. 10,000 against the second respondent, District Forest Officer, Kallakurichi, for vindictive and malicious prosecution. This is a strong message to the authorities that they cannot abuse their power and harass citizens who are seeking justice.

The court has also ordered that the petitioner's retiral benefits be disbursed within four weeks. This is a relief for the petitioner, who had been facing financial difficulties due to the suspension of his benefits.

Overall, the court order is a significant victory for the petitioner and a strong message to the authorities that they cannot abuse their power and harass citizens who are seeking justice. The court has upheld the principles of justice and fairness and has ensured that the accused are not given undue advantage by the authorities.
