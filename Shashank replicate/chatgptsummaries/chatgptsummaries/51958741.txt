The case against Banti Singh was related to the theft of Bajri, which is a type of sand used in construction. The theft was carried out in violation of Sections 379 I.P.C. and Section 29/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The accused was arrested and charged with the crime. However, the court has now granted him bail, subject to certain conditions.

The conditions of the bail require the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- and two sureties in the sum of Rs.25,000/- each. These sureties must be approved by the learned trial court. Additionally, the accused-petitioner is required to appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The granting of bail is a common practice in the Indian legal system. It allows the accused to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing. However, bail is not granted automatically. The court must consider several factors before deciding whether to grant bail or not. These factors include the nature of the crime, the evidence against the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing, and the potential danger posed by the accused to society.

In this case, the court has decided that Banti Singh is eligible for bail. The conditions of the bail are designed to ensure that he appears before the court on all dates of hearing and does not flee. The personal bond and sureties are a form of security that the accused will not abscond. Additionally, the requirement to appear before the court on all dates of hearing ensures that the trial can proceed smoothly.

It is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that the accused is innocent. It simply means that the court has decided that he is eligible for bail. The trial will continue, and the accused will have to prove his innocence in court.

In conclusion, Banti Singh has been granted bail by the court in a case related to the theft of Bajri. The conditions of the bail require him to furnish a personal bond and two sureties, and to appear before the court on all dates of hearing. The granting of bail is a common practice in the Indian legal system, and it allows the accused to be released from custody while the trial is ongoing.
