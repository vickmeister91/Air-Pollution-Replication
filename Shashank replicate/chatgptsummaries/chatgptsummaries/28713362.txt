The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes between landlords and tenants over the eviction of the latter from their rented premises. In the first case, Sheela Malhotra filed an eviction petition against Meera Gupta and others for a shop in East Patel Nagar, New Delhi, claiming that the shop was required for her son's readymade garment business. The respondents filed an application for leave to defend, stating that they were the actual owners of the shop and had been in possession since 1972 without paying rent. They also claimed to have a document proving ownership, which had been misplaced. The court was deciding on whether to grant leave to defend.

In the second case, the petitioner had filed an eviction petition under section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, which required the petitioner to establish ownership of the premises, a bonafide requirement for themselves or a dependent family member, and no other suitable accommodation. The respondents had raised a defense that the petitioner had failed to establish ownership and landlord-tenant relationship. However, the petitioner had provided sufficient documentary proof, including a conveyance deed and house tax receipts, to establish ownership. The defense raised by the respondents was vague and did not raise any triable issue. The court had considered the arguments of both parties and made a decision.

In the third case, the court had discussed various defenses raised by the respondents in an eviction petition filed by the petitioner. The court had rejected the defense that there was no landlord-tenant relationship between the parties, as it was not necessary for a written agreement to exist for the creation of tenancy under the DRC Act. The court had also dismissed the defense that the petitioner's children had a different surname, stating that it was the petitioner's prerogative to name her children. The defense of alternative accommodation was also rejected, as the court found that the open space adjacent to the respondent's shop was not suitable for the petitioner's son to open a shop. Overall, the court had found that the defenses raised by the respondents were sham defenses and did not raise any triable issue.

In the fourth case, the court had ruled in favor of the landlord in a dispute over the suitability of a shop for the tenant's business. The court had cited previous cases to establish that it was the landlord's prerogative to decide which premises were suitable for their business expansion and that a tenant could not dictate terms to the landlord. The court had also noted that the tenant's claim that an adjacent shop was sold by the landlord was not a valid argument as the landlord had the right to sell their property for any reason. Ultimately, the court had ruled in favor of the landlord and allowed them to evict the tenant.

In the fifth case, the court had affirmed the trial court's decision that the requirement of section 14(1)(e) was a "bonafide requirement" and should be seen as per the petitioner's (landlord's) requirement, even if the landlord was wealthy and had other properties. The court had also dismissed the leave to defend application. The court had further held that the landlord was the best judge of their requirement for residential or business purposes and had complete freedom in the matter. The court had rejected the tenant's defense that eviction would leave them without a source of income, stating that the special summary procedure provided for under the DRC Act was an exception to the general intent of the Act and that frivolous and vague allegations could not defeat the summary procedure. The court had also recognized the moral duty of a father/parent to help establish their son's business and that such a requirement was a bonafide one.

In the final case, the court had stated that the petitioner, a landlord, had a genuine requirement for the tenanted premises for her son's readymade garments business. The court had rejected the defense raised by the respondents and granted an eviction order against them. The court had also mentioned that the purpose of summary procedure under Section 25B of the Act would be defeated if leave to contest was granted to the tenant without a prima facie case being disclosed. The eviction order was not executable for six months from the date of the order.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of establishing ownership and a bonafide requirement for eviction under the Delhi Rent Control Act. The courts have consistently ruled in favor of landlords who can provide sufficient documentary proof of ownership and a genuine need for the premises for themselves or their dependent family members. The courts have also rejected sham defenses raised by tenants and recognized the landlord's prerogative to decide which premises are suitable for their business expansion. The special summary procedure provided for under the DRC Act is an exception to the general intent of the Act and is meant to provide a speedy resolution to disputes between landlords and tenants.
