The court order pertains to two separate cases where the liability of the insurer was contested. In the first case, a cleaner in a bus was injured due to the negligence of the driver and claimed compensation from the owner of the vehicle, the driver, and the insurer. The tribunal found the driver and owner liable to compensate the cleaner, but the insurer contested its liability. The court found that the insurer was not liable as the policy did not cover the liability of the cleaner. The appellant challenged the finding that he could not claim indemnity, but the court upheld the tribunal's decision. The court also considered whether the cleaner could be treated as a third party and relied on a previous judgment to hold that the cleaner could not be considered a third party.

In the second case, the court order states that the term "cleaner" in reference to the seating capacity of a vehicle does not mean that the cleaner is a passenger. The deceased employee's claim was already adjudicated upon by the Workmen's Compensation Court, which only directed compensation on the basis that the deceased was an employee, not a passenger. The Motor Vehicles Act requires insurance coverage for third-party risks, but a cleaner of a bus is not included among the employees in respect of whom there is to be compulsory coverage under the "Act Only" insurance policy. The court concludes that the injured cleaner cannot be considered a third party and falls within the ambit of the proviso to Section 147(1). Therefore, there is no merit in the appeal, and it is dismissed.

In both cases, the liability of the insurer was contested, and the court had to determine whether the cleaner could be considered a third party. In the first case, the cleaner was injured due to the negligence of the driver, and the owner and driver were found liable to compensate the cleaner. However, the insurer contested its liability, arguing that the policy did not cover the liability of the cleaner. The court agreed with the insurer and held that the cleaner could not be considered a third party under the policy.

The appellant in the first case challenged the finding that he could not claim indemnity, but the court upheld the tribunal's decision. The court relied on a previous judgment to hold that the cleaner could not be considered a third party. The court found that the cleaner was not a passenger and did not fall within the definition of a third party under the policy. Therefore, the insurer was not liable to compensate the cleaner.

In the second case, the court order states that the term "cleaner" in reference to the seating capacity of a vehicle does not mean that the cleaner is a passenger. The deceased employee's claim was already adjudicated upon by the Workmen's Compensation Court, which only directed compensation on the basis that the deceased was an employee, not a passenger.

The court concluded that the injured cleaner could not be considered a third party and fell within the ambit of the proviso to Section 147(1). Therefore, there was no merit in the appeal, and it was dismissed. The court order clarifies that the term "cleaner" does not mean that the cleaner is a passenger and that the cleaner cannot be considered a third party under the policy.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two cases where the liability of the insurer was contested. In both cases, the court had to determine whether the cleaner could be considered a third party. The court found that the cleaner could not be considered a third party under the policy and that the insurer was not liable to compensate the cleaner.
