The High Court of Kerala in Ernakulam issued a court order on July 10, 2015, regarding a writ petition filed by M/S. Joseph & Company. The petition sought to quash the termination of their lease in respect of Beatrice Estate in the Nelliyampathy Hills. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately affirmed the termination of the lease but set aside the invocation of a bank guarantee. The order includes a detailed summary of the history of the lease and various transactions related to it.

In another case, the court discussed the termination of a lease for forest land in Nelliyampathy due to a breach of lease conditions. The lessee, Sri.K.K.Joseph, had transferred possession of 50 acres without obtaining prior permission from the government. The government issued a notice to terminate the lease, which was challenged by the petitioner firm. The court found that the petitioner firm was recognized as the lessee in possession and set aside the termination order. The court directed the government to reconsider the matter and restore possession of the estate to the petitioner.

The court also discussed a dispute over a lease of land known as Beatrice Estate. The petitioner claimed to have the right to extract minerals and granite from the land under lease, and the government had recognized the petitioner as the lessee. The court ultimately declined to interfere with the judgment but ordered the government to consider the contentions of the parties and take a final decision in the matter in accordance with the law. The government issued a notice to terminate the lease, and the court ordered a show-cause notice to be issued and for the government to pass a reasoned order after due consideration of objections filed by the respondent. The status quo as to possession was ordered to continue until the matter was disposed of by the government.

The court order stated that the leasehold property is a Reserve Forest and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 applies to it. The government had terminated the lease due to the lessee's non-compliance with the covenant and the Forest Conservation Act. The petitioners had challenged the termination order, but they were considered squatters and encroachers of forestland and had no locus standi to claim any right over the Reserve Forestland. The forest officials were empowered to summarily evict any encroachment on Reserve Forestland without prior notice. The court issued a show-cause notice to the Managing Partner of the firm to terminate the lease in respect of the forestland. The reply to the show-cause notice should be submitted within a period of fifteen days from the date of receipt of this notice. The government had terminated the lease after considering all aspects of the case.

In another case, the court discussed a dispute over a lease agreement for a coffee estate in Kerala, India. The government argued that the lease agreement was only with an individual named K.K. Joseph and not with the firm Joseph & Co., which was registered later. The government also claimed that the transfer of lease rights to others without their written consent is a violation of the agreement. The court found that the land in question is a reserve forest and that the lease is terminable. The court also noted that previous court cases have established the land's status as a reserve forest.

The court order confirmed that the Beatrice Estate is a notified Reserve Forest and that the approval of the Government of India, Ministry of Environment & Forest is required for the regularisation of transfer of leasehold right to M/s Joseph & Co. The court also stated that M/s Joseph & Co. cannot have the benefit of Clause 12 of the lease agreement for remedying the defaults as the firm was not in existence on 15.12.1979. The court concluded that the status of the petitioners amounts to be of encroachers and squatters in Reserve Forest land and they can be evicted and dispossessed of the unauthorised occupation even without notice to the party. The court also confirmed the termination of the lease of 246.26 acres of Reserve Forest land (Beatrice Estate) at Nelliampathy in Palakkad district made to Sri.K.K.Joseph, for violating the conditions of the lease agreement signed on 15.12.1979 and the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

In the last case, the court discussed the validity of a lease agreement for a piece of land. The court considered various documents, including a partnership deed, a ledger, and a sale deed, to determine the existence of a partnership and the lessee of the land. The court found that the partnership firm is the lessee and that the termination of the lease was not in compliance with the lease agreement. The court also noted that the lessee did not obtain prior permission from the lessor before subletting or assigning the lease.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed various disputes over lease agreements for forest land and coffee estates in Kerala, India. The court affirmed the termination of some leases due to non-compliance with the covenant and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. In other cases, the court directed the government to reconsider the matter and restore possession of the estate to the petitioner. The court also confirmed the status of some petitioners as encroachers and squatters in Reserve Forest land and ordered their eviction and dispossession of the unauthorized occupation. The court also noted that the lessee must obtain prior permission from the lessor before sublet
