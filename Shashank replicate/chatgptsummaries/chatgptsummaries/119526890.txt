The court order in question pertains to an application filed by tenants who claim to have lawful tenancy rights in a property that is part of land surrendered by the respondent as per the approved plan of DDA. The court ultimately rejects the application, citing an earlier order by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that occupiers of such land have no right to resist the execution of orders passed by the court. The application is dismissed with costs of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited with DLSA (Central).

The case at hand involves tenants who claim to have lawful tenancy rights in a property that is part of land surrendered by the respondent as per the approved plan of DDA. The tenants filed an application seeking relief from the court, but their application was ultimately rejected. The court cited an earlier order by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that occupiers of such land have no right to resist the execution of orders passed by the court.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the law must be upheld and that orders passed by the court must be executed. The court notes that the tenants have no legal right to resist the execution of orders passed by the court, and that their claim to lawful tenancy rights is not sufficient to override the court's orders.

The court's decision is also based on the fact that the land in question was surrendered by the respondent as per the approved plan of DDA. This means that the respondent has no legal claim to the land, and that the tenants' claim to lawful tenancy rights is therefore invalid.

The court's decision to dismiss the application with costs of Rs. 10,000/- to be deposited with DLSA (Central) is intended to serve as a deterrent to others who may seek to resist the execution of court orders. The court notes that the costs are to be deposited with DLSA (Central) in order to support the organization's efforts to provide legal aid and assistance to those in need.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is based on the principle that the law must be upheld and that orders passed by the court must be executed. The court's decision serves as a reminder that occupiers of land surrendered by the government have no legal right to resist the execution of court orders, and that claims to lawful tenancy rights are not sufficient to override the court's orders.
