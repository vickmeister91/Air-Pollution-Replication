The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Tomy Abraham against the Naranammoozhi Grama Panchayath and others. The petitioner holds two quarrying leases to mine and extract building stones. The petitioner had obtained all the requisite permissions and licenses to carry out quarrying operations until 2012-'13. However, the license was not renewed thereafter due to objections raised by people residing in the vicinity of the quarries. After a few rounds of litigations, the license was renewed in 2016-'17, and the petitioner applied for renewal of the license for the period 2017-'22. The Secretary of the Panchayat rejected the application for renewal, citing non-compliance with certain conditions imposed on the petitioner in terms of the Environmental Clearance, environmental issues, and adverse impact on the means of livelihood of the people in the Panchayat.

The court heard the petition on December 7, 2017, and delivered its judgment on the same day. The petition includes several exhibits, such as copies of quarrying leases, licenses, and judgments passed by the court. The exhibits also include photographs of the petitioner's quarry and paper publications made by the petitioner in compliance with certain conditions.
