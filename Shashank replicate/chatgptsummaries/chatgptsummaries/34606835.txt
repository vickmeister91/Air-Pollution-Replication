The Bombay High Court recently heard and decided on four petitions challenging an order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate, 62nd Court, Dadar, Mumbai, issuing process under various sections of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, 2000. The petitioners, who are accused, challenged the order on the grounds that the construction of the Bandra Worli Sea Link Project led to an abnormal increase in vehicular traffic and air and noise pollution. The court heard all the petitions together and disposed of them by a common order.

The court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Central Pollution Control Board regarding air and noise pollution caused by traffic movement in BSWL. The complainant relied on studies conducted by NEERI and noise monitoring conducted by accused No. 21. The NGT had passed an order of amicable settlement in 2016, but there was no change in pollution levels. The court issued process against accused Nos. 1 to 5, 10 to 15, 19 to 22 for violating the Environment Protection Rules and Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules. The accused filed writ petitions challenging the order. The petitioners argued that the order of issuance of process against them was bad in law as the complaint and documents relied therein did not disclose any offence committed by them.

The court order discusses arguments made by both the defense and the complainant in a case related to noise and air pollution. The defense argues that no offense has been committed and that the National Green Tribunal has no jurisdiction. They also argue that the notice given is deficient and that the complaint is vague. The complainant cites orders and directions given by the National Green Tribunal and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to support their case. The court will need to consider these arguments before making a decision.

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has directed the Traffic Commissioner to check the pollution levels of vehicles on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link for compliance with BS-IV standards. The complainant alleges that the Traffic Department has not taken suitable measures to control pollution after collecting data on noise pollution. The accused have failed to comply with relevant provisions of Environment Protection Rules and Noise Pollution (Regulation & Control) Rules, as well as the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has issued process based on the complaint. The complainant gave notice of the alleged offence and his intention to make a complaint to the Central Government or authority or officer authorized. The notice was addressed to the Principal Secretary, Environment Department and the Member Secretary, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.

The court order refers to a complaint made under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, regarding controlling air and noise pollution. The court analyzes the sections under which the magistrate has issued process and concludes that the accused officers, who are not involved in manufacturing or industry, cannot be held responsible under sections 7 and 8 of the Act. Section 9 requires a person in charge to intimate the fact of pollution and render assistance to authorities and agencies, while section 10 gives power of entry and inspection to collect data of pollution and prevent pollution. Section 15 provides for penalties for contravention of the Act, and section 16 deals with offences by companies. The accused officers are not companies or directors, so section 10 and 16 are not applicable. Section 17 deals with offences by government departments and officers, and the accused officers can only be held responsible under this section if it is found that the offence was committed due to negligence or connivance.

The court order discusses various provisions of the Environment Protection Act and Rules, as well as the Noise Pollution Regulation and Control Rules. It clarifies that certain sections and rules do not apply to the issue of heavy vehicular traffic, which is not considered an industry, process, or operation. The complaint filed against various individuals and entities is also discussed, with some being dropped from the case. The court emphasizes the importance of fulfilling legal obligations to maintain ecological balance and prevent pollution.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal in penalizing those who violate environmental laws. The court notes that while the Tribunal has the power to impose penalties for non-compliance with its orders, it cannot try or punish accused persons found guilty under the Environmental Protection Act. The court also refers to an order by the Tribunal directing the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to prescribe noise standards for the use of sirens and multi-toned horns, and notes that the Tribunal has the power to hold authorities in contempt and prosecute them for non-compliance with its orders.

The court order discusses the use of inherent powers by the High Court to quash and set aside criminal proceedings. The court cites various judgments to establish the criteria for issuing process against the accused. The court also examines the allegations made in the complaint against the Nevatia group and finds them to be vague and not constituting a specific offense. The court notes that the authorities have taken steps to comply with the orders of the National Green Tribunal, but if there is pollution, it should be controlled.

The court order states that the documents and communication presented in the complaint show that the accused parties have taken steps to control air and noise pollution as per the order of the National Green Tribunal. However, the complainant suggests that
