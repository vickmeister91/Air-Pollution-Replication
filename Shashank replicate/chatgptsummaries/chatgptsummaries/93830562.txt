In a recent court order, Sri Sai Saptagiri Sponge Pvt. Ltd. filed a writ petition against the Assistant Executive Engineer, the Environmental Regional Officer of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and the Deputy Commissioner of Bellary District. The petitioner sought a direction to reconnect and restore power supply to their industry, which had been disconnected by the Gulburga Electricity Supply Company. The court noted that the petitioner had obtained necessary permissions and had applied for clearance from the Pollution Control Board, but the Board had not disposed of the application. The court also observed that the land on which the petitioner's industry was located had been allotted by the government for industrial purposes.

The court held that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of deemed permission under Section 25 of the Water Act, as the application had not been disposed of within the stipulated time. The court also noted that the directions issued by the Pollution Control Board to disconnect power supply were not applicable to the petitioner. The court directed the respondents to restore power supply to the petitioner's industry.

The court order also discusses the Water Rules 1975, which mandates that any proposed directions issued by the board affecting the carrying of any industry, operation, or process must also be endorsed to the occupier of the industry, operation, or process. The court examines whether the impugned direction issued by the first respondent is by the Environment Officer of the Board at Bellary and concludes that the direction issued to the first respondent is not by the competent authority.

The court allows the writ petition, quashes Annexure "J," and directs the first respondent to connect the power supply to the petitioner industry. The second respondent is directed to dispose of the applications pending before it afresh within three months in accordance with the law.
