The court has granted bail to Kalu Ram, who was in custody for an offence under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner does not have any criminal antecedents and a challan has been filed against him for a magistrate triable offence. The court has ordered his release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and biodiversity. It is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, as well as their habitats. The Act also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Section 9/51 of the Act deals with the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary or national park without a permit. The offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In this case, Kalu Ram was arrested for an offence under Section 9/51 of the Act. However, the court has granted him bail on the grounds that he does not have any criminal antecedents and that a challan has been filed against him for a magistrate triable offence. A challan is a document that contains the details of the offence committed and the evidence collected by the investigating agency. It is filed before the magistrate's court, which has the power to try the offence.

The court has ordered Kalu Ram's release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each. A personal bond is a written undertaking by the accused that he will appear before the court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. A surety bond is a written undertaking by a third party, usually a family member or friend of the accused, that he will ensure the accused's appearance before the court. The surety also undertakes to pay the amount of the bond in case the accused fails to appear before the court.

The court has stipulated that Kalu Ram must appear before the trial court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This is a standard condition that is imposed while granting bail. The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the accused does not abscond and that the trial proceeds smoothly.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Kalu Ram, who was in custody for an offence under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has taken into account the fact that the petitioner does not have any criminal antecedents and that a challan has been filed against him for a magistrate triable offence. The court has ordered his release on bail upon furnishing a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court with the stipulation to appear before that Court on all dates of hearing and as and when called upon to do so. This decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and the rule of law.
