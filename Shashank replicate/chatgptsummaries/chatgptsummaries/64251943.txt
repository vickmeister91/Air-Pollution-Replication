The State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials have been facing multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court order lists the details of each petition and petitioner. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department.

The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area.

The court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

The court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

The court order pertains to a forest land proposal for a cluster area of 281 hectares. The mining lease holders had refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and were also refusing to pay the NPV amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur.
