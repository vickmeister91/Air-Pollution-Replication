The original order was passed on 15th July 2009, dismissing the writ appeal filed by the petitioner against the order passed by the single judge in a forest conservation case.

However, the court found that the original order was passed based on the submissions made by the counsel for both parties, and that the joint survey report did not support the petitioner's claim. Therefore, the court dismissed the review petition.
