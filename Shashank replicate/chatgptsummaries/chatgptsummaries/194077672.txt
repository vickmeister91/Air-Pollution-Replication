The court order pertains to a dispute over land ownership in Koheda village, Ranga Reddy district. The case involves multiple implead petitions and revisions related to land ownership. The revision petitioners opposed the implead petitions, but ultimately, all the implead petitions were allowed by the court. The revision grounds in the case involve issues related to the validity of certificates and records, and the failure of the quasi-judicial authority to act judicially. The counter-arguments of the respondents state that the Joint Collector's order is based on revenue records and there is no illegality committed. The R.2 initially passed an order granting 38-E certificates after correction of records, and the R.1 relied on these records.

The court order lists various plots of land with their respective sizes and registration details. It also mentions the agreement of sale cum GPA with possession deed numbers and dates for each plot. The order also includes the names of petitioners who are being impleaded in the case. The court allowed the impleadment of 15 additional parties who claimed to have purchased plots in the disputed land and sought to protect their interests. The order lists the plot numbers and documents of the impleaded parties.

The court order from 03.02.1984 granted 38-E certificates to villagers in Koheda village after incorrect entries in tenancy records were corrected. The Tahsildar conducted a local enquiry and prepared a corrected tenancy register based on physical possession, which was accepted by those in actual possession. The register showed protected tenants in possession of specific survey numbers. The names of those not in physical possession were deleted from the records. The petitioners did not raise objections and later executed a GPA after receiving corrected 38E certificates.

The court found that the petitioners had accepted the corrections and even executed sale deeds to third parties based on the corrected survey numbers. The court dismissed the revisions and found that the claims made by the petitioners were false and unsubstantiated. The court also found that the petitioners cannot claim the wrong survey numbers which were shown in their name earlier and that the provisions of the AP (Telangana area) Tenancy Act are not applicable in view of the change of nature of the land. The court also found that the petitioners had taken advantage of the corrected survey numbers and cannot put forth any claim on the earlier incorrect protected tenancy survey numbers.

The court order states that the petitioners are legal successors of the PT and any correction or alteration made without notifying them is illegal and violates the Act and principles of natural justice. The alleged enquiry and correction of records did not take place, and assuming it did, it was done without issuing any notice to the PT or his legal heirs. The court also denies the claim that the subject lands were converted into non-agriculture and sold to third parties. The Joint Collector dismissed the appeals by order, dt.11.07.2014, holding that if the appellants have any objection, they ought to have filed the same before the RDO at the time of publication of provisional list and final list of protected tenancy. The court allows the revisions.
