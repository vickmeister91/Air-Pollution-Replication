In a recent court order, the case of a motor vehicle accident was reviewed. The parents of the deceased had filed an appeal for enhanced compensation, and the court found that the tribunal had not been justified in deducting 50% of the deceased's income towards personal and living expenses. Instead, the court determined that only 1/3 should have been deducted. Additionally, the court found fault with the compensation awarded for medical expenses, transportation of the deceased's body, and loss of love and estate.

As a result of these findings, the court enhanced the compensation to Rs. 7,92,000 and ordered the respondents to bear their costs. This decision was based on a careful review of the evidence presented in the case, as well as an analysis of relevant legal precedents.

One of the key issues in this case was the question of how much of the deceased's income should be deducted for personal and living expenses. The tribunal had deducted 50%, but the court found that this was not justified. Instead, the court determined that only 1/3 should be deducted, based on a careful analysis of the deceased's income and expenses.

Another issue in the case was the compensation awarded for medical expenses, transportation of the deceased's body, and loss of love and estate. The court found fault with the original compensation awarded by the tribunal, and determined that an enhanced amount was necessary to fully compensate the deceased's family for their losses.

Overall, this court order represents an important decision in the field of motor vehicle accident compensation. By carefully reviewing the evidence and applying relevant legal precedents, the court was able to arrive at a fair and just decision that will provide much-needed support to the deceased's family.
