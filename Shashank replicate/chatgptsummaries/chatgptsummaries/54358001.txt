The Supreme Court of India has issued a notice to the State of Uttarakhand, returnable within three weeks, after perusing the CEC Report (Interim) No.16/2019, filed by Central Empowered Committee. The report suggests that the State of Uttarakhand is constructing Laldhang Chillarkhal Road which passes through the corridor between Rajaji and Corbett Tiger Reserves, without taking advice from the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) or permission from the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife. The court ordered that further construction of the road be stopped immediately due to numerous violations of the Forest Conservation Act.

The CEC report highlights that the construction of the road is in violation of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
