On April 7, 2015, a court order was issued in response to a Criminal Original Petition filed by Punnaivanam against the Inspector of Police, District Crime Branch, Virudhunagar, Virudhunagar District. The petitioner had sought to quash a memo issued under Section 160(1) and 91 of Cr.P.C. by the Inspector of Police, District Crime Branch, on March 13, 2015, as illegal and in violation of the law. The court allowed the petition and set aside the memo, with liberty given to the respondent to proceed further in accordance with the law.

The case involved a memo issued by the Inspector of Police, District Crime Branch, which the petitioner claimed was illegal and in violation of the law. The memo had been issued under Section 160(1) and 91 of Cr.P.C., which deal with the power of police officers to require attendance of witnesses and production of documents. The petitioner argued that the memo was issued without any basis or justification and was intended to harass and intimidate him.

The court considered the arguments put forward by both parties and ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioner. The court found that the memo had been issued without any basis or justification and was therefore illegal and in violation of the law. The court also noted that the memo appeared to have been issued with the intention of harassing and intimidating the petitioner.

As a result of the court's ruling, the memo was set aside and the respondent was given liberty to proceed further in accordance with the law. This means that the respondent was free to take any further action that was legally permissible, but that any such action would need to be based on a valid legal basis and not on the illegal memo that had been issued previously.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as an important reminder of the need for police officers to act within the bounds of the law and to avoid any actions that could be seen as harassment or intimidation. It also highlights the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and ensuring that all citizens are treated fairly and justly.
