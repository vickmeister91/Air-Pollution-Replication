The Bhavani River in Tamil Nadu, India, has been polluted by the discharge of effluents from a distillery owned by Sakthi Sugars Ltd. The case was brought before the court, which found that the High Court of Judicature at Madras had failed to appreciate the gravity of the situation and had disposed of the writ petition merely on the consent of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The court set aside the High Court's order and remanded the writ petition for fresh disposal in accordance with the law.

The court also directed the High Court to consider the reports submitted by the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and to examine the question of restitution of the areas damaged by pollution. The court allowed the Industry to have a test-run or become operational subject to certain safeguards and remedial measures to be taken. The High Court was directed to monitor the case and appoint an amicus curiae to assist it for disposal of the case.

The Industry was directed to pay a sum of Rs 20,000 by way of costs, which shall be deposited in the account of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee within one week.
