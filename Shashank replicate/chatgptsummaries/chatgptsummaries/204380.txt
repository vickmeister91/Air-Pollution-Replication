In a recent court order, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee's approval for the environmental release of Bt. Brinjal in India was declared null and void. The order was issued in response to a petition filed by Dr. K. Thiruthanikachalam, the editor of a Tamil monthly magazine. The petitioner sought a declaration that the approval granted by the committee was not valid. The court heard the petition and was presented with a statement by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, which imposed a moratorium on the release of Bt. Brinjal until independent scientific studies establish the safety of the product from the point of view of its long-term impact on human health and the environment.

The court disposed of the petition and informed the petitioner that an appeal is available to him under Rule 19 of the Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-organisms and Genetically Engineered Organisms or Cells Rules, 1989, before the Appellate Authority. The court's decision was based on the fact that the approval granted by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee was not valid, as it did not take into account the long-term impact of Bt. Brinjal on human health and the environment.

The court's decision was a significant victory for those who have been advocating for the safety of genetically modified crops.
