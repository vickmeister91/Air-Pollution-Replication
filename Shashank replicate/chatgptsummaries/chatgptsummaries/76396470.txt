The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by several individuals against the Union of India, the Southern Railway, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, and others. The petitioners submitted various complaints and representations regarding pollution caused by the railway station in Thiruvalla. The court considered these documents along with the respondents' submissions and issued an order, the details of which are not provided in the given text.

However, the court order refers to a series of representations and petitions regarding pollution caused by the unloading of cement bags at Thiruvalla Railway Station. The Kerala State Human Rights Commission directed the railway authorities to take action against the pollution, but the issue was resolved when the authorities stated they had no intention of constructing a cement yard at the station. However, a notification was issued for the doubling of the railway track between Chengannur and Chingavanam, which includes the augmentation of the goods platform at Thiruvalla.

The court order discusses the issue of a railway goods shed in Thiruvalla that deals with inward traffic of all commodities, including cement. An advocate commissioner was deputed to investigate the matter and found that a new goods platform is proposed to be constructed to replace the old one, which will reduce the distance between the platform and residential houses. The report also highlights the pollution caused by the unloading of cement bags and the inconvenience caused to nearby residents. The Thiruvalla Municipal Council has passed a resolution condemning the move to augment and shift the goods platform. The court notes that the respondents cannot take inconsistent stands and must address the pollution issue.

The court order pertains to a case where respondents were attempting to construct a cement yard under the guise of line doubling, despite a previous court order stating that there was no proposal for such construction. The court cites previous cases where storing, loading, and unloading cement in public areas was deemed to be a violation of the right to life. The court quashes a notification related to the expansion of an existing goods platform at Thiruvalla Railway Station and directs respondents to ensure that existing activity does not cause pollution or health hazards to passengers or nearby residents. The court allows the doubling of railway tracks and shifting of the existing goods platform as long as its dimensions are not changed or its activity augmented.

The court order is significant as it addresses the issue of pollution caused by the railway station in Thiruvalla. The court notes that the respondents cannot take inconsistent stands and must address the pollution issue. The court also highlights the importance of protecting the right to life of citizens and cites previous cases where storing, loading, and unloading cement in public areas was deemed to be a violation of the right to life.

The court order directs respondents to ensure that existing activity does not cause pollution or health hazards to passengers or nearby residents. The court also allows the doubling of railway tracks and shifting of the existing goods platform as long as its dimensions are not changed or its activity augmented. This decision is significant as it balances the need for development with the need to protect the environment and the right to life of citizens.
