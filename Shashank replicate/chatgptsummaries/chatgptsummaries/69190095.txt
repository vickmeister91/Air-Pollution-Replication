The bail application was made on the grounds of false identity, non-inclusion in the First Information Report (FIR), and length of detention.

Section 9 of the act deals with hunting in a sanctuary or national park, while Section 27 deals with possession of any animal, article, trophy, or uncured trophy. Section 31 deals with the use of prohibited arms and ammunition, while Section 35(8) deals with the use of poison or explosive substances for hunting.
