The court order pertains to multiple appeals filed against orders passed by the Division Bench and the Contempt Court. The first appeal, filed under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, challenged orders dated 7.10.2015 and 11.12.2015 in COCP No.2108 of 2015 and the order dated 1.4.2016 in CM-6066-67/CII-2016. The court allowed an application seeking condonation of delay of 167 days in filing the appeal and granted permission to place on record Annexures A-1 to A-23. The court dismissed an application as infructuous as the main appeal itself had been disposed of. The court also granted exemption from filing certified copies of the annexures.

The second appeal pertained to a case where the appellants challenged orders passed by the Division Bench regarding the identification of forest land. The court held that contempt proceedings could be initiated for non-compliance of the directions issued in the final order. The Committee's report based on satellite imagery was not accepted as a final verdict on the demarcation of forest/non-forest area. The court also held that interim orders with such directions and observations could be made by the contempt court. The orders dated 7.10.2015 and 11.12.2015 could be lawfully challenged in this appeal. The court dismissed the applications filed for clarification/modification and issued a show cause notice against the person who filed them.

The third appeal dealt with the demarcation of forest and non-forest areas. The court ruled that satellite imagery cannot be relied upon as conclusive proof in demarcating forest and non-forest areas, and that the demarcation must be based on government records available as of October 25, 1980. The court also ruled that the contempt court has the authority to pass appropriate directions to remedy non-compliance, and that the appellants are not entitled to challenge the same orders before the court. The court further stated that the contempt court was right to reject the plea for clarification/modification of the orders, and that the decision taken by the contempt court that no clarification or modification was warranted is perfectly in order. The court also issued a show cause notice to Sh. Vishavjeet Khanna for seeking review of the orders passed by the contempt court.

The fourth appeal dealt with the review of the orders passed by the court. The court stated that in a case of review, the entire order passed by the court will have to be subjected to judicial reexamination. The appellants were given liberty to seek clarification/modification of the orders passed by the Contempt Court, but they chose to seek review of the orders instead. The show cause notice issued to Sh. Vishavjeet Khanna for proposed contempt cannot be faulted. The State shall identify the forest land based on the Government records maintained as on 25.10.1980, and shall not rely upon the satellite imagery taken on 17.5.1981. The appeal is dismissed.

In summary, the court order dealt with multiple appeals related to contempt proceedings and the demarcation of forest and non-forest areas. The court allowed an application seeking condonation of delay in filing an appeal and granted permission to place on record annexures. The court held that contempt proceedings could be initiated for non-compliance of the directions issued in the final order and that satellite imagery cannot be relied upon as conclusive proof in demarcating forest and non-forest areas. The court also issued a show cause notice against a person who sought clarification/modification of the orders and dismissed an appeal seeking review of the orders. The State was directed to identify forest land based on government records maintained as of October 25, 1980, and not rely on satellite imagery taken on May 17, 1981.
