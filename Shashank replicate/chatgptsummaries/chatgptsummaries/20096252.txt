The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various criminal cases, including rape, murder, and sexual assault. In one case, Sachin Kumar Singhraha was convicted for various offenses under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The prosecution case was based on circumstantial evidence, and the accused was suspected of kidnapping and murdering a five-year-old girl. The court received a criminal reference and appeal from the First Additional Sessions Judge, Maihar, District Satna, for confirmation of the death sentence imposed on the accused. The court disposed of both the criminal reference and appeal by a common judgment. The court found that the evidence formed a complete chain pointing to the accused as the perpetrator, and the defense did not dispute the basic facts of the case but argued against the death penalty.

In another case, the court discussed the appeal of a criminal case in which the appellant argued that he did not commit the crime and that the evidence against him is unreliable. The court analyzed the circumstances of the case and the principles of proof based on circumstantial evidence. The court found that the prosecution had not fully established the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn and that the evidence is not conclusive. The court also noted that the judgment suffered from verbosity and repetition of evidence. The court ultimately set aside the conviction and acquitted the accused-appellant of all charges.

The court also discussed the principles of circumstantial evidence in criminal cases. It cited various cases and legal experts to establish that the circumstances relied upon must be fully established and consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The court then applied these principles to the evidence presented in a specific case, concluding that the prosecution had conclusively proved one circumstance beyond reasonable doubt.

In another case, the prosecution presented evidence that the accused had custody of the girl before her death, and that he was seen with her by multiple witnesses. The court also found the testimony of a key witness to be credible, despite challenges to his credibility by the defense. The court ultimately found the accused guilty of the murder based on the evidence presented.

The court also discussed the admissibility of a disclosure statement and recovery memos in a criminal case. The defense argued that the accused was not in police custody when the memos were prepared, but the court held that an accused is deemed to be in custody when giving information and getting recoveries made. The court also rejected the defense's argument that the witnesses were interested parties and found their testimonies credible. The court then discussed the autopsy report, which showed injuries on the deceased's body, including bruises on the neck and genitalia, and a tear in the hymen.

In another case, the court examined the medical reports and testimonies of witnesses and found the accused guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering the victim. The court also found the accused guilty of causing the disappearance of evidence by throwing the victim's body into a well. However, the court acquitted the accused of the charge of kidnapping. The court also found errors in the sentencing and set aside some of the sentences. The court examined whether the case falls under the category of the rarest of the rare cases in which death sentence can be inflicted.

The court discussed the criteria for determining the "rarest of the rare" cases where the death penalty can be imposed. The court considered factors such as the brutality of the crime, the motive behind it, and the impact on society. The court also weighed aggravating and mitigating circumstances, such as the offender's prior record and the circumstances of the crime. The order provided a list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances for consideration in determining the appropriate punishment.

The court also discussed the factors that should be considered when determining the sentence for a criminal offense, including the circumstances of the offense, the age of the accused, the likelihood of the accused committing the crime again, and the possibility of rehabilitation. The order also weighed aggravating and mitigating circumstances in a specific case involving the rape and murder of a young girl, ultimately affirming the death sentence for the accused. The order concluded with instructions for sending copies of the judgment to relevant parties.

In conclusion, these court orders provide insights into the principles of circumstantial evidence, the criteria for determining the "rarest of the rare" cases where the death penalty can be imposed, and the factors that should be considered when determining the sentence for a criminal offense. The orders also highlight the importance of credible witnesses and the admissibility of evidence in criminal cases.
