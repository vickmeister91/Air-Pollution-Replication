The court recently rejected a petition filed by Prakash Chandra Dwivedi under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate (C.J.M.) Sidhi. The order in question had rejected an application filed by the applicant under Section 457 of the Cr.P.C. The forest officials had registered a case against the applicant under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act as well as the Indian Forest Act.

The applicant had sought the release of his vehicle on Supurdginama, which is a document that allows for the release of property that has been seized by the police or other authorities. However, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate had rejected the application, and the applicant had subsequently filed a petition challenging this decision.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, found no illegality or infirmity with the order impugned and rejected the petition. This decision was based on the fact that the applicant had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that the vehicle in question was not involved in the alleged offence.

The court's decision was in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that all parties be given a fair hearing and that decisions be based on evidence and facts. The court also noted that the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act were in place to protect the environment and wildlife, and that it was important to enforce these laws in order to preserve the natural resources of the country.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and providing evidence to support claims made in court. It also underscores the need to enforce laws that protect the environment and wildlife, and to hold individuals accountable for any violations of these laws.
