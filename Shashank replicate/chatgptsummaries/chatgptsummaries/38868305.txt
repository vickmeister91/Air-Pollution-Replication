The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) heard multiple appeals related to insolvency cases involving various companies. The first case involved Renaissance Steel India Pvt. Ltd, Electrosteels Steel India Ltd, and Bhushan Steel Ltd. The parties involved were represented by various senior advocates and advocates. The court order lists the case numbers and the bench members present during the hearing. The second case was related to insolvency cases involving Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Bhushan Steel Ltd., Bhushan Energy Ltd., and Brij Bhushan Singal. The order lists the advocates representing each party and the case numbers. The judgment is not summarized in this text.

The third case pertains to appeals related to the resolution process of Electrosteels Steels Limited and Bhushan Steel Ltd. The common question of law is whether Vedanta Limited and Tata Steel Limited are eligible as resolution applicants and not barred by Section 29A (d) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The court considers various appeals challenging the eligibility of these companies and examines issues related to their subsidiaries and past legal issues. The court ultimately approves the resolution plans submitted by Vedanta Limited and Tata Steel Limited.

The fourth court order pertains to a case where KCM was found guilty of four charges, including failure to comply with regulations for discharging effluent. The court imposed a monetary fine on KCM. The appellant argued that KCM's conviction makes Vedanta Limited, a related and connected party, ineligible under Section 29A(d) of the I&B Code. The counsel for Vedanta Limited argued that the conviction was not for an offense punishable with imprisonment for two years or more, which is a requirement under Section 29A(d). The counsel for the Committee of Creditors did not take a stand on the issue.

The fifth court order discusses the interpretation of Section 29A(d) of the I&B Code, which makes a person ineligible to submit a resolution plan if they or their subsidiary have been convicted of an offense punishable by imprisonment for two years or more. The court considers whether this applies to juristic persons, such as companies, and whether a company can be considered an undesirable person even if it has been convicted of a serious crime. The court also examines the case of Tata Steel Ltd. and its connection to a company convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act in the UK. Ultimately, the court concludes that the literal interpretation of Section 29A(d) does not apply to juristic persons and that a purposive interpretation is necessary to advance the objects of the law.

The sixth court order discusses Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which outlines the eligibility criteria for submitting a resolution plan. It states that a person is ineligible if they have been involved in certain types of transactions, have executed an enforceable guarantee for a debtor, or have been subject to any disability under any law in a jurisdiction outside India. The order also defines a "connected person" as someone who is a promoter or in management or control of the resolution applicant or the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of the resolution plan. The order clarifies that if a connected person is ineligible, then the person submitting the resolution plan is also ineligible.

The seventh court order discusses the interpretation of Section 29A (d) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. The court examines whether the term "imprisonment" in the section applies only to natural persons or also to juristic persons. The court concludes that the section only applies to natural persons who can be imprisoned. However, the court also suggests a purposive interpretation of the section, which would allow for a corporate entity to be disqualified under Section 29A (d) if it has been convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more. The court argues that the purpose of the Act is to prevent undesirable persons from gaining control of a corporate debtor, and therefore, a corporate entity found to be indulging in an offence punishable under Prevention of Corruption Act should not be held eligible to be a resolution applicant merely because it is not a natural person.

The eighth court order discusses the eligibility of corporate entities as resolution applicants under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court states that a corporate entity can be held liable for the actions of its human agents and that the concept of vicarious liability is not new in criminal jurisprudence. The court also interprets Section 29A (d) of the I&B Code, which disqualifies a person from submitting a resolution plan if they have been convicted of an offence punishable with imprisonment for two years or more. The court clarifies that the word "punishable" in this section refers to the offence and the penalty prescribed by law, and not the viability or feasibility of implementing the punishment. The court emphasizes that each case must be examined based on its facts to determine if Section 29A (d) is applicable.

The ninth court order states that the disqualification, debarment, and ineligibility stemming from a conviction for an offense is not an indicator of the feasibility of implementing the punishment. Vedanta Limited, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources PLC, is considered a connected person of KCM, which has been held guilty of four offenses relating to pollution. The question is whether the offense punishable under Section 91(1) of the
