The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a case where the grant of 203 leases for quarrying granites in government lands under Rule 3 of the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1969, was challenged. The court found that the grants were made contrary to the prohibition contained in Rule 3A and were therefore quashed. The government had attempted to support the grants under Rule 66, which confers on the government the power of relaxation of rules in special cases, but the court rejected this argument. The court held that the grants were made only under Rule 3 and that Rule 66 was not available to support them.

The court order discusses the application of Rule 66 in granting quarrying leases. It states that the government must form an opinion that public interest requires the grant of such leases on terms and conditions other than those prescribed in the rules. This opinion must be formed after considering the facts and circumstances of each case. The power of relaxation must be exercised separately in each individual case, which was not done in the case of the 203 leases in question. The court rejects the argument that the grants were made under Rule 3 with the prior approval of the government. The court also dismisses the argument that the grants should be examined on the basis of Rule 3A as it existed on the date of the grant. The court holds that the grants made against the prohibition contained in Rule 3A were invalid and do not require any further consideration. The appeals are dismissed with costs.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following the rules and regulations in granting leases for quarrying granites in government lands. The court has made it clear that the power of relaxation under Rule 66 must be exercised separately in each individual case after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has also emphasized that the grants made against the prohibition contained in Rule 3A are invalid and do not require any further consideration.

The court order also raises questions about the role of the government in granting leases for quarrying granites in government lands. The court has rejected the argument that the grants were made under Rule 3 with the prior approval of the government. This raises questions about the level of involvement of the government in the grant of such leases. The court has also made it clear that the government cannot use Rule 66 to support grants made under Rule 3 if they are contrary to the prohibition contained in Rule 3A.

The court order is likely to have an impact on the quarrying industry in Karnataka. The quashing of the 203 leases is likely to have an impact on the supply of granites from Karnataka. The court order is also likely to lead to a review of the process of granting leases for quarrying granites in government lands in Karnataka. The government may need to review its policies and procedures to ensure that they are in line with the rules and regulations governing the grant of such leases.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the grant of 203 leases for quarrying granites in government lands under Rule 3 of the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1969, highlights the importance of following the rules and regulations in granting leases for quarrying granites in government lands. The court has made it clear that the power of relaxation under Rule 66 must be exercised separately in each individual case after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has also emphasized that the grants made against the prohibition contained in Rule 3A are invalid and do not require any further consideration. The court order is likely to have an impact on the quarrying industry in Karnataka and may lead to a review of the process of granting leases for quarrying granites in government lands in Karnataka.
