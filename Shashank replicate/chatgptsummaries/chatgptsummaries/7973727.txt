A court order has been issued in connection with a bail application filed by Teerath and two others in a forest crime case. The applicants are accused of hunting wild pig and possessing its meat. The court has allowed the bail application on certain conditions. Each applicant is required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount. Additionally, the applicants are required to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. and not indulge in similar offenses during the trial.

The case pertains to a forest crime, where the accused are alleged to have hunted wild pig and possessed its meat. The court has allowed the bail application filed by Teerath and two others, subject to certain conditions. The applicants are required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount. This is a common practice in bail applications, where the court requires the accused to furnish a bond and a surety to ensure that they will appear in court when required.

In addition to the bond and surety, the court has also imposed certain conditions on the applicants. These conditions are enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. and are meant to ensure that the accused do not indulge in similar offenses during the trial. The conditions may include reporting to the police station at regular intervals, surrendering their passports, refraining from leaving the country without the court's permission, and refraining from contacting witnesses or tampering with evidence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is based on several factors. The court may have considered the nature of the offense, the evidence against the accused, the likelihood of the accused fleeing the country, and the likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses. The court may have also considered the accused's past criminal record, if any, and their ties to the community.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is not a reflection of their guilt or innocence. It is simply a decision to release them from custody while the trial is ongoing. The accused are still required to appear in court when required and comply with the conditions imposed by the court.

In conclusion, the court has allowed the bail application filed by Teerath and two others in connection with a forest crime case. The applicants are accused of hunting wild pig and possessing its meat. The court has allowed the bail application on the condition that each applicant furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount. The applicants are also required to comply with the conditions enumerated in sub-section (3) of Section 437 of Cr.P.C. and not indulge in similar offenses during the trial. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is based on several factors and is not a reflection of their guilt or innocence.
