The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Kamlesh Dangi against an order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge in Sehore. The petitioner had requested the court to summon the report submitted by the Investigating Officer in respect of other co-accused persons under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). However, the application was dismissed by the judge.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section is often invoked by parties to obtain documents or other evidence that may be relevant to their case.

In this case, Kamlesh Dangi had sought the production of the report submitted by the Investigating Officer in respect of other co-accused persons. It is not clear from the available information what the nature of the report was or why Dangi sought its production. However, it appears that the judge dismissed the application on some ground or the other.

The court has now called for the case diary and listed the matter for 6.2.2013. It is not clear from the available information what the purpose of calling for the case diary is or what will happen on 6.2.2013. It is possible that the court may reconsider Dangi's application in light of the case diary or may take some other action in the matter.

Overall, the court order in question appears to be a routine procedural matter. It is not clear from the available information what the underlying case is or what the significance of the report sought by Dangi is. However, it is clear that Dangi's application to summon the report was dismissed by the judge and that the court has now called for the case diary and listed the matter for a future date.
