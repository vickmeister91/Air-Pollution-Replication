The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti, Sri Ganganagar, challenging an order passed by the learned Addl. Sessions Judge, No.2, Sri Ganganagar in revision. The petition sought to challenge the decision of the learned revisional court in reversing the order passed by the learned Magistrate directing the accused to place certain documents on record. The accused is facing trial upon a complaint filed by the petitioner.

The court, in its order, dismissed the petition and the stay petition, stating that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be used for directing the accused to submit documents. The court upheld the decision of the learned revisional court in this regard.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to issue such summons or order either on its own motion or on the application of any party to such proceeding.

In the present case, the learned Magistrate had directed the accused to place certain documents on record, presumably under the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. However, the learned revisional court had reversed this order, holding that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be used for directing the accused to submit documents.

The court, in its order, has agreed with the decision of the learned revisional court. The court has held that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. are not meant to be used for directing the accused to submit documents. The court has further held that the accused cannot be compelled to produce any document or thing which he is not legally bound to produce.

The court has also observed that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. are meant to be used for the purposes of investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The court has held that the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. cannot be used for the purpose of directing the accused to submit documents.

The court has, therefore, dismissed the petition and the stay petition filed by Krishi Upaj Mandi Samiti, Sri Ganganagar. The court has upheld the decision of the learned revisional court in reversing the order passed by the learned Magistrate directing the accused to place certain documents on record.
