The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Parwat Singh under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner had been arrested on 21.12.2018 in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court found that the petitioner had no criminal antecedents and that custodial interrogation may not be required. As a result, the court allowed the bail application with certain stringent conditions.

One of the conditions of the bail was that the petitioner had to provide a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two solvent sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. This was to ensure that the petitioner would appear before the court when required and would not abscond. Additionally, the petitioner was directed to comply with various conditions, including appearing before the trial court once a week till the conclusion of the investigation.

The court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found that the petitioner had no criminal antecedents, which suggested that he was not a flight risk. Secondly, the court noted that custodial interrogation may not be required in this case, which further reduced the need for the petitioner to be kept in custody. Finally, the court was satisfied that the stringent conditions imposed on the petitioner would be sufficient to ensure that he would not abscond or interfere with the investigation.

It is worth noting that the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was not unconditional. Rather, the court imposed several conditions on the petitioner, including the requirement to provide a personal bond and sureties, as well as the requirement to appear before the trial court once a week. These conditions were designed to ensure that the petitioner would not abscond or interfere with the investigation.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioner was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal principles. The court was satisfied that the petitioner did not pose a flight risk and that custodial interrogation may not be required. However, the court also recognized the need to impose stringent conditions on the petitioner to ensure that he would not abscond or interfere with the investigation. As a result, the court allowed the bail application with certain conditions, including a personal bond and sureties, as well as the requirement to appear before the trial court once a week.
