The court order pertains to a dispute over the ownership of a property in Hyderabad. The petitioner filed a writ petition against the 2nd respondent for deleting his name from the mutation records of a property without following due process of law and replacing it with the name of the 4th respondent. The petitioner claimed that he inherited the property from his father and the 4th respondent had forged documents to claim ownership. The 2nd respondent issued mutation proceedings in favor of the petitioner, but later canceled it after receiving objections from the 4th respondent and seeking legal opinion. The 4th respondent claimed that the property was gifted to her by her father and she was in peaceful possession and enjoyment of it. The implead respondents 5 to 7 claimed that they had purchased the property from the petitioner and their names were mutated in the records. The court heard arguments from all parties involved.

The 4th respondent had her name mutated in the municipal records in 1989 based on a gift deed executed by her father. In 2012, the petitioner requested to determine vacant land tax payable to the property, and his name was mutated in place of the 4th respondent based on a legal opinion without issuing any notice to her. When the 4th respondent objected, the proceedings were cancelled and her name was mutated back in her favor based on another legal opinion.
