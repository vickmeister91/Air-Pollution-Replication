The court heard several cases related to forest land use and conservation. In one case, the court considered a writ petition and appeal regarding the Cochin Forest Act III of 1080 ME, which allowed for the constitution of any area as a reserve forest. The case involved several coffee estates that were treated as enclosures within state reserves, and the court considered lease deeds and sale deeds related to the estates. The petitioner had filed a case seeking a direction to conduct a comprehensive survey and to prevent the respondents from attaching any portion of the plantation. The Forest Department later informed the petitioner that they were not entitled to undertake any activities in the area other than those mentioned in the lease deed, and the petitioner filed another case seeking a direction not to interfere in the conduct of plantation tourism. The State Government issued a show cause notice to the petitioner asking why the lease should not be terminated, and the petitioner submitted an explanation. The Government ultimately decided to order the resumption of an area of 486 acres.

In another case, the court considered a dispute over the cancellation of a lease for forest land used for non-forest purposes, including a tourism resort. The petitioner argued that there was no prohibition on the transfer of the leasehold rights and that the lease could only be cancelled for the portion of the land used for non-forest purposes. The government argued that the land was part of a reserve forest and subject to regulations prohibiting non-forest use, and that the lease was rightly cancelled. The court heard arguments from both sides and did not make a final ruling in this order.

The court also considered the estates of Manalaroo, Nelliampathy, and Riffle Butts, which were declared as reserved forests under the Cochin Forest Regulation III of 1080 and later under the Travancore-Cochin Forest Act, 1951. The court ruled that no right can be acquired in or over a reserved forest except under a grant or contract in writing made by or on behalf of the government or by succession from such a person. The sale deed dated 26.04.1994 was found to be void and hit by Section 22 of the 1961 Act. The State was not estopped from raising objections regarding the validity of the sale deed.

The court also discussed the interpretation of the word "succession" in the context of hereditary trusteeship and its application to the present case of acquisition of rights in a reserved forest. The court cited a previous case where the definition of hereditary trustee was discussed and concluded that it does not apply to the present case. The court emphasized the duty of citizens to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, and noted that the provisions of Section 22 of the 1961 Act restrict the acquisition of rights in reserved forests. The court concluded that the petitioner could not have acquired any right in the reserved forest contrary to the provisions of Section 22.

The court also prohibited the clearing of forest land for any purpose other than reafforestation or for work related to conservation, development, and management of forests and wildlife. The order cited the public trust doctrine, which states that the state is the trustee of all natural resources meant for public use and enjoyment, and is under a legal duty to protect them. The Forest Conservation Act of 1980 prohibits de-reservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval of the Central Government. The order also cited previous court cases that clarify the definition of "forest" and "forest land" and emphasize the need for conservation and protection of forests.

In another case, the court considered a petitioner who had used leased forest land for non-forest purposes, in violation of the 1980 Act. The State had cancelled the lease, and the petitioner had challenged this decision. The court upheld the State's decision, stating that the cancellation was in accordance with the provisions of the 1980 Act. The court also dismissed the petitioner's argument that the State could only cancel the portion of the lease on which non-forest activity was carried out. The court allowed a writ appeal filed by the State, setting aside a judgment of the learned Single Judge. The court dismissed the writ petition and ordered the parties to bear their own costs.

Overall, the court's orders emphasized the importance of conservation and protection of forests and the need for strict adherence to regulations related to forest land use. The court also clarified the restrictions on the acquisition of rights in reserved forests and the need for prior approval of the Central Government for any non-forest activity on forest land. The court's orders serve as a reminder of the importance of responsible and sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of present and future generations.
