The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Committee of Management of Adarsh Shri Vishwanath Gurukul Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya challenging the validity of an order passed by the Vice Chancellor revoking the suspension of the Principal of the Institution. The petitioners alleged that the order was passed without giving them a personal hearing and without authority of law. The respondents argued that the writ petition was not maintainable as an alternative remedy was available under Section 68 of the U.P. State Universities Act.

The court held that the writ petition was maintainable as it fell under the exceptions laid down in the case of Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar Trade Marks. The court observed that the petitioners had alleged violation of principles of natural justice and that the Vice Chancellor had acted without authority of law. The court noted that the petitioners had not sought any relief under Section 68 of the U.P. State Universities Act and that the writ petition was maintainable.

On merits, the court held that the denial of a personal hearing did not result in any prejudice to the petitioners and that the Vice Chancellor had considered all the material submitted by both parties before passing the impugned order. The court observed that the Vice Chancellor had revoked the suspension after considering the explanation given by the Principal and the report of the Inquiry Committee. The court noted that the petitioners had not been able to show any prejudice caused to them by the revocation of the suspension.

The court also considered the argument of the respondents that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to order for single operation of accounts under the U.P. State Universities Act. The court observed that the impugned order had directed for single operation of accounts and that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to pass such an order. The court quashed that part of the order while maintaining the revocation of suspension.

In summary, the court held that the writ petition was maintainable and that the Vice Chancellor had not violated any principles of natural justice while revoking the suspension of the Principal. The court also held that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to order for single operation of accounts and quashed that part of the order.

The second court order pertains to the same case and deals with the revocation of suspension order. The court found that the suspension order was based on papers submitted by both parties and that there was no violation of natural justice. The court observed that the petitioners had failed to prove any prejudice caused to them by the revocation of the suspension.

The court also considered the argument of the petitioners that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to order for single operation of accounts under the U.P. State Universities Act. The court observed that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to pass such an order and quashed that part of the order.

In summary, the court held that there was no violation of natural justice in revoking the suspension order and that the petitioners had failed to prove any prejudice caused to them. The court also held that the Vice Chancellor had no jurisdiction to order for single operation of accounts and quashed that part of the order.
