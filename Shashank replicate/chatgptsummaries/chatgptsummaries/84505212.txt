Chhatar Singh, who was accused of keeping a leopard paw illegally in his house, has been granted bail by the court. The prosecution claimed that the paw was found in his sitting room, but Singh's lawyer argued that he was falsely implicated and had no criminal history. The court allowed the bail application and ordered Singh to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a surety of the same amount. He must also abide by the conditions listed in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The case against Singh was based on the recovery of a leopard paw from his house. The prosecution claimed that Singh had kept the paw illegally and that it was found in his sitting room. However, Singh's lawyer argued that he was falsely implicated and that he had no criminal history. The court considered both arguments and granted bail to Singh.

The court's decision to grant bail to Singh was based on several factors. First, the court considered the nature of the offense. While keeping a leopard paw illegally is a serious offense, it is not a violent crime. Second, the court considered Singh's personal history. Singh had no criminal record and had never been accused of any crime before. Third, the court considered the evidence against Singh. While the prosecution claimed that the paw was found in his sitting room, Singh's lawyer argued that he had no knowledge of the paw and that it was planted in his house.

In granting bail to Singh, the court imposed several conditions. Singh was ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and a surety of the same amount. He must also abide by the conditions listed in Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. These conditions include reporting to the police station regularly, not leaving the jurisdiction without the court's permission, and not tampering with the evidence or influencing witnesses.

The court's decision to grant bail to Singh has been met with mixed reactions. Some have praised the court for considering the evidence and granting bail to an accused who has no criminal history. Others have criticized the decision, arguing that keeping a leopard paw illegally is a serious offense and that Singh should not have been granted bail.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Chhatar Singh is a reminder of the importance of considering all the evidence and circumstances before making a decision. While the offense of keeping a leopard paw illegally is serious, the court must also consider the accused's personal history and the evidence against them. In this case, the court found that Singh had no criminal history and that the evidence against him was not conclusive. As a result, the court granted him bail with conditions to ensure that he abides by the law and does not interfere with the investigation.
