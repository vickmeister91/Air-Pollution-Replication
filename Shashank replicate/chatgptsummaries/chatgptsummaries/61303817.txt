The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Harprasad under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Harprasad had been in custody since January 9, 2018, in connection with POR No.28060/2009 registered at the Police Station, S.T.F. Forest Department Hoshangabad, District Hoshangabad (MP) for the offences punishable under Sections 2(16-B), 9, 39, 44, 48-A, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution alleged that Harprasad was carrying a Red Sand Boa Snake (Eryx Johnii) and a Rhesus Macaque (Macaca Multatta), both of which are protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court allowed the bail application and directed Harprasad to furnish a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before it on the dates given by the concerned Court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to ensure the protection of wild animals and plants and to regulate their hunting, possession, and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, with the latest amendment being in 2006. The Act provides for the punishment of offenders who violate its provisions, including imprisonment and fines. The Act also provides for the forfeiture of any property used in the commission of an offence under the Act.

In the present case, Harprasad was charged with offences under Sections 2(16-B), 9, 39, 44, 48-A, 50 and 51 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Section 2(16-B) defines "wildlife" as any animal, aquatic or land vegetation which forms part of any habitat. Section 9 prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 prohibits the possession of any wild animal, trophy, or uncured trophy. Section 44 provides for the punishment for hunting in a sanctuary or national park, while Section 48-A provides for the punishment for the use of traps or snares in hunting. Section 50 provides for the punishment for offences relating to trade or commerce in wild animals, while Section 51 provides for the punishment for abetment and attempts to commit offences under the Act.

The prosecution alleged that Harprasad was carrying a Red Sand Boa Snake (Eryx Johnii) and a Rhesus Macaque (Macaca Multatta), both of which are protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Red Sand Boa Snake is a non-venomous snake that is found in India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. The snake is protected under Schedule II of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which means that it is not an endangered species but is protected due to its ecological importance. The Rhesus Macaque is a species of Old World monkey that is found in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China. The monkey is protected under Schedule II of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

After hearing arguments from both parties, the court allowed the bail application and directed Harprasad to furnish a bail bond of Rs.50,000/- with one surety of the same amount to the satisfaction of the JMFC concerned or trial Court for his appearance before it on the dates given by the concerned Court. The court's decision to grant bail to Harprasad indicates that the court did not find sufficient evidence to keep him in custody. However, it is important to note that the grant of bail does not mean that Harprasad has been acquitted of the charges against him. He will still have to face trial and prove his innocence.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a bail application filed by Harprasad under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Harprasad had been in custody since January 9, 2018, in connection with POR No.28060/2009 registered at the Police Station, S.T.F.
