The Madras High Court recently dismissed a petition requesting a mandamus to stop the construction of a sewerage pumping station in Uttankulam Irrigation Tank, Mayiladuthurai Town. The petitioners argued that the tank was being used as a reservoir for rainwater and that the construction of the pumping station would cause pollution. However, the Commissioner of Mayiladuthurai Municipality argued that the Supreme Court had directed the Ministry of Environment and Forests to provide an Underground Sewerage Scheme to Mayiladuthurai Municipality, and that the pumping station was necessary for the scheme.

The court dismissed the petition and directed the petitioners to seek appropriate remedy under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
