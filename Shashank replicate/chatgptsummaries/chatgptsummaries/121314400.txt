The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently took suo motu cognizance of a news item that reported several villages in the state did not have motorable roads, causing hardship to the residents. The court treated this as a public interest litigation and called upon the state government to provide instructions. The Superintending Engineer of HPPWD acknowledged that several villages were not connected by motorable roads, but stated that some villages were proposed to be connected under the Schedule Caste Component Plan. 

The Ministry of Environment Forests & Climate Change was impleaded as a party respondent, and it was revealed that 'in principle' approval had been accorded for the construction of a link road from Kotighat to Dakolu via Bagaintoo. The Executive Engineer of HPPWD Division Kumarsain filed an affidavit stating that the tender for the formation cutting in 1.510 Kms had been awarded to the lowest contractor. However, the court order stated that the construction of a road cannot begin until trees in the alignment of the road are felled by the forest corporation.

The affidavit revealed that sufficient money is available for the construction of the road, and necessary steps are being taken by the PWD department for the construction of other roads. The court orders the Divisional Forest Officer to issue necessary permission for felling of trees for the construction of the link road and the Executive Engineer to ensure that proposals for diversion of forest land for construction of other roads are submitted to 'MoEF&CC' within two weeks. The court hopes that the roads will be constructed within a year and the petitioner can approach the court again if necessary.

The court's decision is a significant step towards improving the infrastructure in the state and providing relief to the residents of the affected villages. Lack of motorable roads has been a persistent problem in many parts of the country, and it has severely impacted the lives of people living in these areas. The court's intervention in this matter is commendable, and it is hoped that the state government will take necessary steps to ensure that the roads are constructed within the stipulated time frame.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental conservation and the need to balance development with conservation. The court's order that trees cannot be felled until necessary permission is obtained from the forest department is a crucial step towards protecting the environment. It is essential to ensure that development activities do not harm the environment and that necessary steps are taken to mitigate any adverse impact on the environment.

The court's order also emphasizes the need for effective coordination between different departments and agencies involved in infrastructure development. The involvement of the Ministry of Environment Forests & Climate Change in this matter highlights the importance of inter-departmental coordination and the need for different departments to work together towards a common goal.

In conclusion, the Himachal Pradesh High Court's decision to treat the lack of motorable roads in several villages as a public interest litigation and its subsequent orders to the state government and other agencies involved in infrastructure development are significant steps towards improving the lives of people living in these areas. The court's decision also highlights the importance of environmental conservation and the need for effective coordination between different departments and agencies involved in infrastructure development. It is hoped that the state government will take necessary steps to ensure that the roads are constructed within the stipulated time frame and that the court's orders are implemented effectively.
