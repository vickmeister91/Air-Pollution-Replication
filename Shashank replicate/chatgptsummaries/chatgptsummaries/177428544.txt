The Bombay High Court recently issued a court order in the case of State of Maharashtra vs Mr. Charudutta Pandurang Koli and others. The case involves multiple respondents, including companies and individuals, and pertains to environmental concerns in the Mahul Village area of Mumbai. The court order also includes a civil application filed by four individuals residing in the Mahul MMRDA Colony.

The court order lists various entities and individuals, including Aegis Logistics Ltd., the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the Board of Trustees of the Port of Mumbai, and several residents of Jaihind Nagar-Jawahar Nagar in Khar East, Mumbai. The purpose of the court order is not specified.

The court order pertains to two writ petitions challenging the allotment of tenements reserved for Project Affected Persons (PAP) in a PAP colony in Mahul, Chembur. The petitioners in one of the writ petitions have already been relocated to the Eversmile Complex in Mahul, while the petitioners in the other writ petition have received notices allotting them tenements in Mahul but have not yet been evicted from their existing structures. The court discusses the history of the region and the establishment of industrial units in the area. The judgment was reserved on September 19, 2019, and declared on September 23, 2019.

The court order discusses the Eversmile Complex in Mahul, Chembur and the issues faced by the Petitioners who have received notices allotting them tenements in Mahul, Chembur but have not yet been evicted from their existing structures. The PAP colony is located upon land originally demarcated to be a No-Development Zone in the Draft Development Plan of 1984. The location of the Eversmile Colony posits three issues that render the Colony uninhabitable, as per the Petitioners in Writ Petitions (L) No. 874/2018 and (L) No. 3314/2017. The first is that the proximity of the refineries to the PAP colony has resulted in those Petitioners who have been rehabilitated to the colony to suffer from severe health issues due to their exposure to high levels of carcinogenic air pollution. The second, is that the presence of residential premises such in close proximity of industrial belts poses a threat to the security of the industries and refineries, as well as to the safety of the residents themselves. Thirdly, the Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 874/2018 and (L) No. 3314/207 have also contended that the PAP colony is bereft of hygienic conditions and basic amenities, including schools and medical centres.

The court order states that there is air pollution in the Ambapada and Mahul areas due to the presence of VOCs, which are harmful to human health. The National Green Tribunal has issued directions for the preparation of a comprehensive action plan to control air pollution in these areas, including conducting health impact assessment studies and VOC assessment studies. The order also directs the provision of medical facilities and treatment for residents affected by air pollution and the formulation of location criteria for industries handling hazardous chemicals. The order also requires Respondent Nos. 1, 9, and 10 to pay Rs. 5 lakhs each to the applicants as litigation costs. Despite a report claiming that air pollution in Mahul has reduced, government agencies continue to report disturbingly high levels of air pollution in the area.

The court order discusses the high levels of air pollution in Mahul, with concentrations of benzene, styrene, toluene, xylenes, and other VOCs found to be above the prescribed standards. The report recommends regulating land-use development and controlling emissions at the source to minimize the impact on nearby habitats. Another report by NEERI also records alarming levels of air pollution in the area, with major VOC emissions coming from industrial sources and causing potential health impacts. The report suggests that health impacts are more likely to be acute and episodic rather than regular, and that proximity to oil and gas refineries increases health risks.

The court order discusses the potential health impacts of living near oil and gas sites, specifically the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are known carcinogens and can cause a variety of short and long-term health effects. The NEERI report recommends declaring the Chembur and Mahul region an "Air Control Region" and using remote-based technologies to monitor VOCs. The air pollution in Mahul is far higher than permissible standards, and buffer zones should be established to mitigate risks to the health of residents. The IIT report shows that residents of Mahul are still experiencing health issues, including coughing, sneezing, and breathlessness.

The court order lists various health issues experienced by individuals, including sputum, breathlessness, nausea/vomiting, chest pain, and hairfall. The order notes that these health impacts not only lead to increased treatment costs for low-income individuals, but also affect their ability to work and sustain their livelihoods. Over 140 individuals claimed to have lost their jobs due to health-related issues, and over 200 reported loss of wages due to poor health. The order includes a table detailing the impacts of health problems on livelihood, with
