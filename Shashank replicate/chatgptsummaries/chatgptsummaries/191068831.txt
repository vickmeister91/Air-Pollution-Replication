Destination Cafe Private Limited had filed a petition in court seeking to set aside the sealing order passed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) in respect of their restaurant premises in Connaught Place, New Delhi. The petitioner argued that the sealing was arbitrary and without basis, as they had obtained all necessary licenses and permissions from the concerned departments. The NDMC argued that the sealing was carried out in accordance with the directions of the Monitoring Committee appointed by the Supreme Court. The court heard both sides and reserved its judgment.

The court order, which was passed after hearing both sides, rejected the petitioner's plea to approach the Monitoring Committee and noted that the restaurant was operating without hindrance on the basis of a No Objection Certificate. The court found the sealing of the restaurant to be arbitrary and a violation of natural justice. The respondent was directed to issue a show-cause notice to the petitioner within three days and pass a reasoned order within one week thereafter. The petitioner was awarded a cost of Rs. 10,000.
