The court order pertains to two Criminal Misc. Cases filed by accused persons challenging the order passed by the learned S.D.J.M. taking cognizance of an offence under section 15 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 against them. The complaint was filed by the Beach Protection Council of Orissa alleging that the accused persons violated the provisions of the Coastal Regulation Zone notification by constructing a commercial-cum-residential building and apartment over land in the CRZ-II area. The accused persons contended that the impugned order taking cognizance was passed without the sanction of the State Government or of the authority either under section 197 Cr.P.C. or under section 110 of the Orissa Development Authorities Act, 1982 for prosecuting the petitioner - accused no. 1 - Prasant Kumar Pattnaik, who is a public servant, when the allegation made in the complaint is regarding an act while discharging his official duty.

The court order discusses a case involving the violation of Coastal Regulation Zone-II regulations by the accused persons. The complainant alleges that a road leading to a building project was constructed in violation of the regulations. The court examines whether a prima facie case of commission of an offense has been made out by the complainant and whether certain documents can be considered at this stage of the case. The court also discusses the regulations and amendments to them and the existence of the road in question.

The court order states that a road along the sea-shore from Hotel Hans Coco Palm to Sterling Holiday Resorts was in existence before 1990 and was being used by OREDA, despite not being reflected in the revenue map. The alleged sanction of construction was given by the Building Permission Committee of PKDA, which is a statutory body, and the accused cannot be held individually liable for it. The court finds that there is no prima facie evidence to show that the accused committed the alleged offense, and the order taking cognizance of the offense under section 15 of the E.P. Act, 1986 is set aside and the entire proceeding stands quashed.

Therefore, the court set aside the order taking cognizance of the offense and quashed the entire proceeding.

The court further observed that there was no prima facie evidence to show that the accused committed the alleged offense. The court noted that the complainant had not produced any evidence to show that the accused persons had violated the regulations.
