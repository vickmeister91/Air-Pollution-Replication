The court, however, rejected the petitioner's application and noted that the matter had already been disposed of by the trial court. The court observed that the trial court had considered all the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the petitioner and had arrived at a conclusion based on the same. The court further noted that the petitioner had not been able to point out any error in the trial court's decision.

The court also observed that the petitioner had filed several applications under Section 91(1) and 311 of Cr.P.C. in an attempt to introduce new evidence in the case. However, the court noted that these applications had been filed after the trial court had already passed its order and had therefore been rightly rejected by the trial court.
