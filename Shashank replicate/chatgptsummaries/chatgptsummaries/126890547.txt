The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court recently granted bail to Pawan Pardhi, who was accused of violating the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. This was Pardhi's fourth bail application, with the previous three being dismissed. The prosecution alleged that Pardhi was found in possession of a Monitor lizard's body part, which was illegally kept. However, Pardhi's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and had not committed any offense.

After hearing both sides, the court allowed Pardhi's bail application and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and cooperate in the trial. The court also listed six conditions that Pardhi must comply with, including not committing a similar offense and not leaving India without the trial court's permission.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and the conservation of their habitats. The Act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants, as well as their parts and derivatives. Violations of the Act can result in imprisonment and fines.

In Pardhi's case, the prosecution alleged that he was found in possession of a Monitor lizard's body part, which is a violation of the Act. The Monitor lizard is a protected species under the Act, and its hunting, poaching, and trading are strictly prohibited. The prosecution argued that Pardhi had illegally kept the body part and was therefore guilty of violating the Act.

However, Pardhi's counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated and had not committed any offense. They claimed that the body part was not found in Pardhi's possession and that he had no knowledge of it. They also argued that Pardhi was a law-abiding citizen and had no criminal record.

After hearing both sides, the court allowed Pardhi's bail application and directed him to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and cooperate in the trial. The court also listed six conditions that Pardhi must comply with, including not committing a similar offense and not leaving India without the trial court's permission.

The conditions imposed by the court are standard for bail applications and are meant to ensure that the accused does not abscond or commit any further offenses while out on bail. The court's decision to grant bail to Pardhi indicates that it was satisfied with the arguments put forth by his counsel and did not find the prosecution's case to be strong enough to keep him in custody.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Pawan Pardhi in his fourth bail application is a significant development in his case. The court's decision indicates that it was satisfied with the arguments put forth by his counsel and did not find the prosecution's case to be strong enough to keep him in custody. The conditions imposed by the court are standard for bail applications and are meant to ensure that the accused does not abscond or commit any further offenses while out on bail.
