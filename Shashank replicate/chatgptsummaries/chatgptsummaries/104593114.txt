The court has granted pre-arrest bail to Mathew on certain conditions. The conditions include appearing before the investigating officer and not getting involved in any other crime. The court has also directed Mathew not to threaten or intimidate the complainant or witnesses. 

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The Act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where wildlife can thrive without human interference. 

The Act has been in force since 1972 and has undergone several amendments over the years. The penalties for violating the Act are severe and can include imprisonment and fines. The Act has been successful in protecting several endangered species, such as tigers, elephants, and rhinoceroses. 

In Mathew's case, the forest officials had conducted a search in his house and seized two pairs of snouts of wild boar.

The court, after hearing both sides, granted pre-arrest bail to Mathew on certain conditions. The conditions include appearing before the investigating officer and not getting involved in any other crime. The court has also directed Mathew not to threaten or intimidate the complainant or witnesses.
