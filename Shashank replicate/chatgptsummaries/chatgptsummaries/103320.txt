The court orders discussed in this article pertain to civil suits filed against the State of Bombay regarding departmental inquiries against police officers. The first court order relates to a civil suit filed by Ganpat Dhondiba Sawant, who was dismissed from his position as a sub-inspector of police in 1954. Sawant challenged the dismissal order in court, claiming that the departmental inquiry against him was illegal and violated his fundamental rights. The State of Bombay argued that the inquiry was legal and constitutional. The court order provides a detailed account of the events leading up to Sawant's dismissal, including the departmental inquiry against him. However, the court order does not provide a final verdict on the case.

The second court order pertains to a departmental inquiry against a police officer who had been acquitted in a criminal trial and exonerated in a previous departmental inquiry. The government ordered a fresh inquiry, which the plaintiff argued was illegal. However, the court found that the government had the power to order a fresh inquiry under the relevant provisions of the law. The court also found that the rules relating to departmental inquiry did not control the government's power to make inquiries and impose punishments against police officers. The court dismissed most of the plaintiff's claims, except for a claim regarding a sum of money.

The third court order discusses the powers of the state government in relation to the police force. The court states that the state government has absolute power to deal with matters pertaining to the police force throughout the state, including disciplinary action against police officers. The court also rejects the argument that once a police officer has been exonerated in a departmental inquiry, they cannot be charged with the same misconduct again. The court finds that there is no provision in the law to support this argument. The court also discusses the rules for inquiry prescribed under the District Police Act and concludes that they do not apply in this case.

The fourth court order discusses a case related to the exercise of punitive powers by the state government under the District Police Act and the Bombay Police Act. The court finds that the plaintiff was given a fair opportunity to show cause in the matter of the inquiry held against him. The court also dismisses the plaintiff's claim for arrears of salary as it was barred by the law of limitation. The state government's appeal is allowed, and the decree of the lower court dismissing the plaintiff's suits is confirmed. The decree in favor of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 1,701-5-0 and interest is reversed and set aside.

In summary, these court orders provide insight into the legal framework surrounding departmental inquiries against police officers in the State of Bombay. The court orders establish that the state government has absolute power to deal with matters pertaining to the police force throughout the state, including disciplinary action against police officers. The court also establishes that the rules for inquiry prescribed under the District Police Act do not apply in all cases. Additionally, the court orders establish that police officers can be charged with the same misconduct again, even if they have been exonerated in a previous departmental inquiry. Finally, the court orders establish that claims for arrears of salary may be barred by the law of limitation.
