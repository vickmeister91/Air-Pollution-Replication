The Karnataka High Court received a Criminal Petition filed by M/S Athashri-Paranjape Schemes and Mr. Shashank Paranjape, requesting the court to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.4026/2009 U3ki9MxCLC.849/2006 pending on the file of Additional CMM, Bangalore Rural District. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board represented by its Environmental Officer is the respondent in this case. The complaint alleges that the accused persons have taken up construction of 206 residential flats for aged people without obtaining Environmental Clearance Certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, which is a violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court order discusses a case where the accused continued construction without obtaining the necessary Environmental Clearance Certificate and Consent for Establishment, which was intentional and deliberate. The complainant prays for action under the Environment Act and the Government Protection Act. Witnesses include Regional Officer and Assistant Environmental Officer. The learned counsel for the petitioners and respondent present their arguments, and the respondent argues that the petitioners have not approached the court with clean hands. The court carefully examines the materials and allegations and concludes that the accused violated Section 15 of the Environment Act and that the project does not come under the purview of the 1994 notification.

The court order discusses a petition filed by the accused, who argue that their project does not fall under a certain notification. The court states that it has the power to investigate whether the project falls under the notification, and cites a previous case to support this. The court also explains the definition of a complaint in criminal procedure and notes that technicalities should not obscure the purpose of criminal law. The court ultimately decides that the accused have committed an offense and dismisses the petition.
