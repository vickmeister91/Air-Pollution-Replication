The court order pertains to two separate writ petitions filed in relation to mining leases in the Bellary-Hospet region of Karnataka, India. The first petition was filed by M/S Crystalline Rocks P Ltd against the Union of India and others, while the second petition was filed by an unnamed petitioner against various mining leases in the same region.

In the first petition, the court notes that the Ministry of Environment and Forests had approved the lease for 14 hectares of forest land in favor of the 4th respondent, but the remaining area required further approval. The court directs the respondents to dispose of the petitioner's application and quash the annexure passed by R2 on 9th October 2006. The court also notes that the State Government needs to carry out an Environment Impact Assessment study of the whole region before releasing any fresh area for mining.

The court allows the renewal of existing mining leases having an area of more than 5 hectares and permits new mining leases only when common dumping grounds for overburden have been identified. The court also directs the State Government to identify common dumping areas for overburden for a cluster of mines and carry out a detailed study on groundwater resources of the region. The court allows temporary working permission for six months in respect of six pending proposals for forest land more than 20 hectares, subject to environmental safeguards.

In the second petition, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) had granted in-principle forest clearance for the diversion of 44 hectares of forest land for mining purposes. The mining leases were granted for broken up areas and additional areas, subject to conditions and compliance with environmental regulations. The court held that the renewal of the mining leases was in accordance with the law and dismissed the petitioner's application for a mining lease in the same area.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of environmental impact assessments and compliance with environmental regulations in the mining industry. The court allows for the renewal of existing mining leases but imposes strict conditions on new mining leases, including the identification of common dumping grounds for overburden and a detailed study on groundwater resources. The court also allows for temporary working permission for pending proposals for forest land, subject to environmental safeguards.
