In a recent court order, a writ application filed by Shivam Kumar was dismissed. Kumar was running a brick kiln without obtaining the necessary environmental clearance and no objection certificate from the concerned department, which is a violation of the law. The Bihar Pollution Control Board had already passed an order to close the brick kiln, and the petitioner had not filed any relevant document as required.

The court found no merit in the writ application and dismissed it. This decision was based on the fact that Kumar had not followed the necessary legal procedures and had violated environmental laws. The court's decision was in line with the Bihar Pollution Control Board's order to close the brick kiln.

The importance of obtaining environmental clearance and no objection certificates cannot be overstated. These documents are necessary to ensure that businesses and individuals are operating in compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Failure to obtain these documents can result in legal action, as seen in this case.

The court's decision to dismiss the writ application serves as a reminder to individuals and businesses to follow the necessary legal procedures and obtain the required documents before starting any activity that may have an impact on the environment. It also highlights the importance of environmental laws and regulations in protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the writ application filed by Shivam Kumar serves as a reminder of the importance of obtaining environmental clearance and no objection certificates before starting any activity that may have an impact on the environment. It also highlights the importance of environmental laws and regulations in protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development.
