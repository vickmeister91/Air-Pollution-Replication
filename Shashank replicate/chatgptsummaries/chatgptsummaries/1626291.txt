The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Joseph Kurian against the Union of India and the State of Kerala. Kurian had sought the issue of a Writ of Certiorari, quashing proceedings that denied him permission to irrigate his plantation by taking water from the Periyar river through the Reserve Forest Land. The court found that Kurian had no right to the forest land and that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, required the Central Government's prior approval for any use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court upheld the decision of the Central Government to refuse permission for Kurian's proposal and dismissed the writ petition. The court emphasized the importance of conservation and preservation of the environment.
