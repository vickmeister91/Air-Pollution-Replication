The National Green Tribunal recently heard a case brought by the Mayflower Sakthi Garden Owners Association against the State of Tamil Nadu and other respondents regarding the construction of a sewage treatment plant near their residential colony. The tribunal considered the maintainability of the application and the admitted facts of the case, including the objections raised by the association and the report filed by a committee. The High Court disposed of the writ petition with an order to make a spot inspection of the proposed STP and submit a report on specific issues.

The court order directs the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to consider the matter of the proposed sewage treatment plant as per the report submitted by the Committee appointed by the court and pass orders on merits and in accordance with the law within four weeks. The applicant filed a second writ petition seeking to stop the construction of the plant, which became infructuous after the TNPCB passed an order considering the objections raised by the applicant. The applicant filed a third application challenging the consent orders issued by the TNPCB for establishing the STP, which is pending adjudication. The court considers the question of maintainability and notes that this is the third application filed by the applicant, and the previous writ petitions were disposed of with directions to the TNPCB. The present application challenges the order of the TNPCB returning the application filed by the 4th respondent for resubmission.

The court order pertains to an application challenging an order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) returning an original application for resubmission. The court found that the applicant had no cause of action to file the application and dismissed it as not maintainable. However, the court granted the applicant liberty to implead as a party to the proceedings in Appeal Nos. 32 and 33 of 2012 pending before the Appellate Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control, and raise all contentions both legal and factual before the said authority. The parties were ordered to maintain status quo till the disposal of the appeals. The court hoped that the Appellate Authority would dispose of the appeals at the earliest considering the fact that the concerned STP project has public interest.
