The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Digvijay Singh against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the discharge of toxic industrial effluent by textile industries in Barmer District. The petitioner had sought multiple reliefs, including a declaration that the present Common Effluent Treatment Plants be declared obsolete and either the textile industries be shut down permanently or be denied permission to function unless they install the necessary technology to deal with the issue of hazardous effluents.

The court has decided to transfer the matter to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) as it falls under the NGT Act and the Supreme Court has directed that such matters should be dealt with by the NGT. The NGT was established in 2010 under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The NGT has the power to hear all civil cases relating to environmental issues and has jurisdiction over all of India.

The court order states that all matters related to environmental issues covered under the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act and Schedule I should be litigated before the NGT to avoid conflict of orders between the High Courts and NGT. The court directs that all matters instituted after the NGT Act came into force and covered under the provisions of the NGT Act and/or in Schedule I to the NGT Act shall stand transferred and can be instituted only before NGT. The court also cautions that cases filed and pending prior to the NGT Act involving questions of environmental laws and/or relating to any of the seven statutes specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act should also be dealt with by the NGT.

The court upholds the submissions made on behalf of the respondents and orders that the matter (CWP No.2844/2011) and the contempt petition (CCP No.581/2013) shall stand transferred to the NGT. The court does not comment on the merits of the case and nothing observed herein shall have any bearing on the consideration of the matter by the NGT.

The transfer of the case to the NGT is significant as it will ensure that the matter is dealt with by a specialized body with expertise in environmental issues. The NGT has been successful in resolving several high-profile cases related to environmental protection, including the Vedanta case in which the NGT ordered the closure of a copper smelting plant in Tamil Nadu due to environmental concerns.

The court's decision to transfer the case to the NGT also highlights the importance of effective implementation of environmental laws and regulations. The discharge of toxic industrial effluent by textile industries in Barmer District is a serious environmental issue that needs to be addressed urgently. The NGT has the power to impose penalties and fines on industries that violate environmental laws and regulations, which can act as a deterrent and encourage industries to adopt environmentally sustainable practices.

In conclusion, the court order transferring the matter to the NGT is a positive step towards ensuring effective implementation of environmental laws and regulations. The NGT has the expertise and jurisdiction to deal with environmental issues and can impose penalties and fines on industries that violate environmental laws. The transfer of the case to the NGT will also ensure that the matter is dealt with by a specialized body, which will help in resolving the issue in a timely and effective manner.
