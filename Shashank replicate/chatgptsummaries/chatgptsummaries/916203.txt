The Karnataka High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by Smt Jalaja Poojarthi and others against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners had claimed that they were allotted land under the 'Ashraya Scheme' by the State Government, but the officials later claimed that the land belonged to the forest department and was part of the Sumeshwara Wild Life Sanctuary. The State Government had initiated measures to cancel the allotment of house sites in forest areas, and the court quashed the official memorandums issued by the officials and ordered the respondents to put the sites which were allotted in terms of documents issued to them in the possession of the petitioners.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rights of the petitioners who were allotted land under the 'Ashraya Scheme' by the State Government. The court has also quashed the official memorandums issued by the officials, which had led to the cancellation of the allotment of house sites in forest areas. The court has ordered the respondents to put the sites which were allotted in terms of documents issued to them in the possession of the petitioners.

The 'Ashraya Scheme' was launched by the State Government to provide housing to the economically weaker sections of the society. The scheme provides financial assistance to the beneficiaries to construct houses on the land allotted to them by the government. The scheme has been successful in providing housing to a large number of people in the state.

The court order is a significant victory for the petitioners who had been fighting for their rights for a long time. The court has upheld their right to the land which was allotted to them under the 'Ashraya Scheme' and has ordered the respondents to put the sites in their possession. The order will provide relief to the petitioners who had been facing uncertainty and anxiety over the cancellation of their allotment.

The court has also sent a strong message to the officials who had cancelled the allotment of house sites in forest areas without proper investigation and verification. The court has quashed the official memorandums issued by the officials and has ordered them to follow due process while cancelling the allotment of land. The order will ensure that the officials follow the law and do not act arbitrarily while cancelling the allotment of land.

The court order is also significant as it upholds the rights of the economically weaker sections of the society who are the beneficiaries of the 'Ashraya Scheme'. The scheme has been successful in providing housing to a large number of people in the state, and the court order will ensure that their rights are protected.

In conclusion, the court order in the writ petition filed by Smt Jalaja Poojarthi and others against the State of Karnataka is a significant victory for the petitioners and upholds their right to the land which was allotted to them under the 'Ashraya Scheme'. The court has also sent a strong message to the officials who had cancelled the allotment of house sites in forest areas without proper investigation and verification. The order will ensure that the officials follow due process while cancelling the allotment of land and will protect the rights of the economically weaker sections of the society who are the beneficiaries of the 'Ashraya Scheme'.
