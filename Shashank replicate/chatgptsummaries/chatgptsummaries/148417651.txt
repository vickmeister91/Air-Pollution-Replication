The Kerala High Court recently passed a judgment in a case filed by K. Mathew Philip against the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, regarding the surrender of 'Deer Horn' and 'Bison Skull' trophies. The petitioner had inherited these trophies from his grandfather, who was a ranger in the erstwhile Tranvancor Government during 1890-1922. The court found that no opportunity of hearing was given to the petitioner while passing the order to surrender the trophies and set aside the order.

The petitioner had filed a petition challenging the order passed by the Chief Wildlife Warden directing him to surrender the trophies. The petitioner had argued that the trophies were not obtained illegally and that he had inherited them from his grandfather. He had also contended that the order was passed without giving him an opportunity of hearing.

The court observed that the petitioner had inherited the trophies from his grandfather, who was a ranger in the erstwhile Tranvancor Government during 1890-1922. The court also noted that the petitioner had produced documents to show that the trophies were obtained legally. The court further observed that the order directing the petitioner to surrender the trophies was passed without giving him an opportunity of hearing.

The court held that the order passed by the Chief Wildlife Warden was in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court observed that the petitioner had a right to be heard before any order was passed against him. The court also noted that the order was passed without considering the documents produced by the petitioner to show that the trophies were obtained legally.

The court set aside the order passed by the Chief Wildlife Warden and directed the 1st respondent to reconsider the application preferred by the petitioner and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law, after affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner, within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment.

The judgment is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and emphasizes the importance of giving an opportunity of hearing to a person before passing any order against him. The judgment also recognizes the importance of preserving heritage and cultural artifacts and acknowledges the right of a person to inherit such artifacts from his ancestors.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's judgment in the case filed by K. Mathew Philip is a significant step towards upholding the principles of natural justice and preserving heritage and cultural artifacts. The judgment emphasizes the importance of giving an opportunity of hearing to a person before passing any order against him and recognizes the right of a person to inherit such artifacts from his ancestors. The judgment is a welcome move towards protecting our cultural heritage and ensuring that justice is done in a fair and transparent manner.
