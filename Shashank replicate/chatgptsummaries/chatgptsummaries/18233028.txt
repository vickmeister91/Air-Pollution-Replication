The Patna High Court recently issued a court order regarding several cases involving the convening of special meetings of the Nagar Parishad for considering a vote of no confidence against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor. The court order lists the parties involved in two cases, LPA No. 1564 of 2009 and LPA No. 1579 of 2009. The first case involves Ruby Singh as the petitioner/appellant and various government officials and individuals as respondents. The second case involves Pawan Kumar Purbey as the writ petitioner/appellant and the same government officials and individuals as respondents. The order also lists the lawyers representing each party.

The court heard arguments from various advocates representing the appellants and respondents. The Collector-cum-District Magistrate had passed an order adjourning the meeting, which was challenged in a writ petition. The court discussed several writ petitions challenging the circular issued by the State Government regarding the procedure for holding a meeting of no confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor. The court held that the circular was contrary to the provisions of the Act and could not be accepted to remain in force. The court also noted that the District Magistrate could not have been conferred the power by executive instruction in the absence of a rule.

The court directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a special meeting with the agenda regarding the no confidence motion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance with the requisition received. The court also discussed Section 25 of the Act, which deals with the removal of the Chief Councillor and Deputy Chief Councillor. The court rejected the argument that a meeting cannot be held for a motion of no confidence in the absence of rules and cited previous cases to support its position.

The court order also discusses the procedure for holding a special meeting of councillors and the requirement for rules to be made under the Act. It clarifies that the Chief Councillor or Deputy Chief Councillor should preside over meetings, except in cases where a motion for their removal is being considered. The court ultimately concludes that a vote of no confidence can be carried out without the framing of rules and that the provisions of the statute are workable. The court also addresses the issue of convening another meeting after one had already been held, stating that the decision was justified.

In another case, the court order discusses the importance of compliance with accounting standards and presenting true and fair accounts in accordance with the Companies Act. The court cites various cases to support the idea that the workability of the provisions of an act is more important than the framing of rules. The court ultimately concludes that a vote of no confidence can be carried out without the framing of rules and that the provisions of the statute are workable.

The court also discusses a meeting of the Madhubani Nagar Parishad where only 12 out of 30 elected members were present. The court had interdicted the meeting and it was held on a later date without proper notice to all members. The court found that the meeting was not valid and issued a direction to rectify the error. The appeals against this decision were dismissed.

In summary, the court order discusses several cases involving the convening of special meetings of the Nagar Parishad for considering a vote of no confidence against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor. The court clarifies the procedure for holding such meetings and the requirement for rules to be made under the Act. The court also emphasizes the importance of compliance with accounting standards and presenting true and fair accounts in accordance with the Companies Act. The court ultimately concludes that a vote of no confidence can be carried out without the framing of rules and that the provisions of the statute are workable. The court also addresses the issue of convening another meeting after one had already been held, stating that the decision was justified.
