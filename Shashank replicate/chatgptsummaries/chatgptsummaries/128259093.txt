The case of R. Karunasekar involved a criminal original petition seeking a direction to modify an order in S.T.C.1 of 2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate, FTC, Tiruvallur dated 15.06.2015 and direct the respondent/complainant to produce all the documents as prayed for under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The trial judge partly allowed the petition, directing the complainant to file necessary documents only to the extent of the transaction period i.e. May and June 2013 which is relevant, necessary, and desirable for the purpose of trial and to prove the case of the defence. However, the petitioner failed to explain how the documents are relevant, and the court dismissed the petition.

The case highlights the importance of providing relevant and necessary information when seeking a direction to modify an order. The court's decision to partly allow the petition shows that it is willing to consider requests for additional information, but only if it is deemed relevant and necessary for the purpose of the trial.

It is important for individuals involved in legal proceedings to understand the importance of providing relevant and necessary information to the court. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of a petition or even a negative outcome in the trial itself.

In this case, the petitioner failed to provide a sufficient explanation as to why the documents were relevant, which ultimately led to the dismissal of the petition. It is important for individuals to take the time to carefully consider their requests and provide a clear and concise explanation as to why the information is necessary for the trial.

Overall, the case of R. Karunasekar serves as a reminder of the importance of providing relevant and necessary information when seeking a direction to modify an order. It is crucial for individuals involved in legal proceedings to take the time to carefully consider their requests and provide a clear and concise explanation as to why the information is necessary for the trial. Failure to do so can result in negative outcomes and potentially harm the individual's case.
