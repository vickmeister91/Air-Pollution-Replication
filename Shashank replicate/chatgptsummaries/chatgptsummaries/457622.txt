The case of Yashwant Stone Works vs State of Uttar Pradesh And Ors. involved a petition seeking a Mandamus directing the Collector, Mirzapur, to grant a mining lease for stone chips, their crushing, transportation, etc. The application was made under the U.P. Minor Minerals (Concession) Rules, 1963, but the Collector withheld the decision on the application on the ground of prohibition to the granting of leases alleged to have been imposed under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court examined the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and held that prior approval of the Central Government was required for any forest land or any portion thereof to be used for non-forest purposes, including mining operations. The Act was passed to check deforestation and prevent further deforestation. The court also noted that the word "forest" has not been defined in the Act and has been used in the general sense, which means "all lands bearing vegetative associations demarcated by trees of any size exploited or not, capable of producing wood of other forest products of exerting an influence on the climate or on the water regime or providing shelter for livestock and wildlife."

The court order clarifies that the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 applies to all forests, regardless of whether they are reserved or protected. The Act aims to prevent deforestation and ecological imbalances. Therefore, until the Central Government grants permission, the State Government cannot grant any lease or permission for mining. The court also clarifies that renewal of a lease is essentially a fresh lease and requires approval from the Central Government.

In this case, the petitioner's claim for a mining lease is dismissed as the Forest (Conservation) Act applies, and the stay order cannot decide the rights of the parties. The court's decision is in line with the aim of the Forest (Conservation) Act, which is to prevent deforestation and ecological imbalances.
