The court order pertains to an application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by Shajahan.K.A, who is accused No.3 in O.R.No.19/2009 of Thamarasserry Forest Range. The offences alleged against the petitioner are under Sections 2, 9, 50, 51 and 57 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution case is that on 28.09.2009, the accused persons, using a country gun belonging to accused No.3, shot dead a barking deer (Muntiacus Muntjak), which is an animal included in schedule III of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The petitioner had sought anticipatory bail on the grounds that he was falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the alleged offence. The petitioner also contended that he had cooperated with the investigation and had not absconded or tampered with evidence. The prosecution, on the other hand, opposed the bail application on the grounds that the petitioner was a habitual offender and that granting anticipatory bail would adversely affect the smooth and proper investigation of the case.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court dismissed the bail application. The court observed that the allegations against the petitioner were serious in nature and that the investigation was at a crucial stage. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been able to provide any material to show that he was falsely implicated in the case. The court further observed that granting anticipatory bail would adversely affect the smooth and proper investigation of the case, as the petitioner was a key accused in the case and his custodial interrogation was necessary to unearth the truth.

The court also took note of the fact that the petitioner had a criminal history and had been involved in similar offences in the past. The court observed that the petitioner was a habitual offender and that there was a likelihood of him committing similar offences in the future if he was granted bail. The court, therefore, held that the petitioner was not entitled to anticipatory bail and dismissed the bail application.
