In a recent court order, Devender Singh was acquitted of charges under sections 332/461 of the DMC Act for carrying out unauthorized construction without the sanction of the competent authority. The prosecution had presented five witnesses, but the accused denied the charges and did not lead any defense evidence. The court noted that the prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had erected or commenced to erect the unauthorized construction, and the mere presence of a person at the spot may not satisfy this requirement. The court also noted that the prosecution for this offense could not be held except upon the complaint of or upon information received from some officer of the MCD.

The court order further states that a prosecution for an offense under the DMC Act can only be held upon a complaint made to the concerned Magistrate by an officer of the Corporation authorized under the provisions of the Act. In this case, the prosecution failed to follow the procedure as prescribed under section 467 of the Act. The accused is acquitted for the offense punishable under section 332/461 DMC Act due to lack of evidence and infirmities in the prosecution's case. The accused is released on bail.

The court's decision was based on the lack of evidence presented by the prosecution. The prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had erected or commenced to erect the unauthorized construction. However, the mere presence of a person at the spot may not satisfy this requirement. The prosecution failed to provide any concrete evidence to support their claims, and the accused denied the charges.

Furthermore, the court noted that the prosecution for this offense could not be held except upon the complaint of or upon information received from some officer of the MCD. In this case, the prosecution failed to follow the procedure as prescribed under section 467 of the Act. Therefore, the accused was acquitted of the charges under sections 332/461 of the DMC Act.

The prosecution failed to follow the prescribed procedure, which ultimately led to the accused's acquittal. This case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to adhere to proper procedures and present strong evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, the court's decision to acquit Devender Singh of charges under sections 332/461 of the DMC Act was based on the lack of evidence presented by the prosecution and the failure to follow proper procedures. The accused was released on bail, and this case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to adhere to proper procedures and present strong evidence to support their claims.
