The case of M/s Ravi Kant Bansal versus the Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation and others was brought before the court as a writ petition. The petitioner had established a small-scale industry for manufacturing hot mixed asphalt products in the Malanpur area. The lease for the land on which the plant was established was executed on 20.10.1992, and the initial period of the lease was six years, which ended on 19.10.1998. The petitioner sought direction from the respondent to consider their application for the extension of the lease deed and restrain respondent No. 1 from removing their hot mixed plant.

The petitioner argued that the reason for the non-extension of the lease period was the lack of a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Pollution Control Board. However, the court dismissed the petition as the petitioner had not obtained the necessary NOC from the Fire Station Malanpur and misrepresented facts in the writ petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not fulfilled the necessary requirements for the extension of the lease period. The court found that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary NOC from the Fire Station Malanpur, which was a requirement for the extension of the lease period. The court also found that the petitioner had misrepresented facts in the writ petition, which further weakened their case.

The court's decision was a reminder that it is essential to fulfill all the necessary requirements before seeking legal remedies. The court's decision also highlighted the importance of honesty and transparency in legal proceedings. The court's decision was a clear message that misrepresenting facts in a writ petition is not acceptable and can lead to the dismissal of the petition.

In conclusion, the case of M/s Ravi Kant Bansal versus the Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation and others was dismissed by the court as the petitioner had not fulfilled the necessary requirements for the extension of the lease period. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not obtained the necessary NOC from the Fire Station Malanpur and had misrepresented facts in the writ petition. The court's decision was a reminder of the importance of fulfilling all the necessary requirements before seeking legal remedies and the importance of honesty and transparency in legal proceedings.
