Sunil, who has been in jail since June 25, 2019, in a case related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, has been granted bail by the court. Sunil has been accused of keeping the dead body of a peahen in his compound, but his lawyer argued that he has been falsely implicated in the case. The court has imposed certain conditions for his release on bail, including filing an undertaking not to seek adjournments and remaining present before the trial court on each date fixed.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, and the latest amendment was made in 2006.

Sunil's case is related to the Act, and he has been accused of keeping the dead body of a peahen in his compound. The peahen is a protected species under the Act, and keeping its dead body is a violation of the Act.

The court has granted bail to Sunil, taking into consideration the arguments made by his lawyer. The court has imposed certain conditions for his release on bail, including filing an undertaking not to seek adjournments and remaining present before the trial court on each date fixed. These conditions are meant to ensure that Sunil cooperates with the trial court and does not delay the proceedings.

The granting of bail to Sunil is a significant development in the case, as he has been in jail for more than a year. The case has attracted attention from animal rights activists, who have been advocating for the protection of peafowl, which are a symbol of India's rich biodiversity.

In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of cases related to the Act, as well as in the severity of the penalties imposed on violators. This is a reflection of the growing awareness among the public about the importance of wildlife conservation and the need to protect India's rich biodiversity.

The granting of bail to Sunil is a reminder that the legal system in India is committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served. The court's decision to impose conditions on Sunil's release on bail is a reflection of its commitment to ensuring that the trial proceeds smoothly and that justice is served.
