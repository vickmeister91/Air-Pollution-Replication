The case of Sri S Basavaraju, a retired Municipal Commissioner, was brought before the II-Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Chitradurga, in C.C.No.394/2007. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had lodged a private complaint against the petitioner, alleging that he had committed offences punishable under Section 25 of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner argued that permission under Section 197 Cr.P.C. was not obtained by the respondent before filing the private complaint. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that no sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. is required before initiating prosecution.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted to prevent and control water pollution. Section 25 of the Act deals with the penalty for contravention of the provisions of the Act. The Act empowers the State Pollution Control Board to take action against any person who violates the provisions of the Act. In this case, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had lodged a private complaint against Sri S Basavaraju, alleging that he had committed offences punishable under Section 25 of the Act.

Sri S Basavaraju, in his defence, argued that permission under Section 197 Cr.P.C. was not obtained by the respondent before filing the private complaint. Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, deals with the prosecution of public servants. It states that no court shall take cognizance of an offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant, except with the previous sanction of the government. Sri S Basavaraju argued that since he was a retired Municipal Commissioner, he was a public servant, and hence, the respondent should have obtained permission under Section 197 Cr.P.C. before filing the private complaint.

However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that no sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. is required before initiating prosecution. The court held that the provisions of Section 197 Cr.P.C. are applicable only when a public servant is accused of an offence committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. In this case, the allegations against Sri S Basavaraju were not related to his official duty as a Municipal Commissioner. Hence, the court held that no sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. was required before initiating prosecution.

In conclusion, the case of Sri S Basavaraju, a retired Municipal Commissioner, was brought before the II-Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Chitradurga, in C.C.No.394/2007. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board had lodged a private complaint against the petitioner, alleging that he had committed offences punishable under Section 25 of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. Sri S Basavaraju argued that permission under Section 197 Cr.P.C. was not obtained by the respondent before filing the private complaint. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that no sanction under Section 197 Cr.P.C. is required before initiating prosecution. The court held that the provisions of Section 197 Cr.P.C. are applicable only when a public servant is accused of an offence committed while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty.
