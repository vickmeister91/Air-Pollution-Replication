The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Baljinder Kaur against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The court issued various directions to the state and pollution control board to inspect the canals, remove inlets discharging filthy substances, and prepare short and long-term schemes to prevent pollution. The court also directed the state to provide safe drinking water to affected villages and to provide a status report on the analysis of water samples. The case was adjourned to a later date.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them for contamination. The state is also ordered to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and prevent contamination in a given time frame. The court imposes a penalty of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating the water and directs the state to impose this penalty and recover the amount from the offender. The court also directs the state to publish notices about this penalty and submit a compliance report. The court orders the District Collector to be present on the next hearing and warns of imposing a cost if the state fails to submit the action plan and scheme.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution in Sriganganagar. The National Green Tribunal had already passed an order for the removal of encroachments, but the state government had not taken effective action. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation. The court also ordered the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and directed the state government to file a compliance report. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the state government's attitude and warned of appropriate action if the directions were not followed.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The court has given multiple opportunities to the state authorities to comply with the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to remove encroachments and collect compensation from the encroachers. However, the authorities have been slow in taking action, and the court has directed the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief, as it has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if the inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that before approaching a writ court with an allegation that a tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction, the original applicant must exhaust all remedies provided by the Act of 2010. The tribunal has the power to condone the delay in filing the application within the prescribed limitation. The court also notes that the remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India, and the writ court should be slow in entertaining any issue under the jurisdiction of the tribunal. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos. 86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015 by December 31, 2016. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until December 31, 2016.
