The court order pertains to a Public Interest Litigation filed by E.S. Aadithiyan against the District Collector and the Commissioner of Pammal Municipality, Kancheepuram District, Chennai. The petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the respondents from constructing a Municipal Solid Waste Management Plant/Transfer Station on lands designated as a public park in Survey No.148 at Viswesapuram Layout, Pammal Village. The petitioner argued that the construction of the plant would cause nuisance to the residents and that the area was earmarked for a park. The Municipality filed a counter-affidavit stating that the area had not been used as a park and that the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 had been notified for proper disposal of solid waste. The National Green Tribunal had also directed not to dump solid waste in the area.

The court order discusses the establishment of a micro-composting facility in a park site in Pammal Municipality for proper disposal of household waste. The composting will be carried out in hermetically constructed tubs using bricks and concrete of proper specifications for waterproofing and will be self-contained to prevent any spread of decaying matter or leachate into the surrounding environment. The project has been granted administrative and technical sanction, and objections from residents have been addressed. The micro-composting facility will occupy only a small portion of the park site, and the rest of the park will have recreational facilities for residents. The process involves odourless technology and disposal of packaged end product, and there will not be any inconvenience to residents living adjacent to the facility.

The court order states that a park site, which is currently vacant, has been given to the respondent for the purpose of setting up a Micro Compost Plant to process highly decomposable waste. The respondent has already set up 7 Micro Compost Plants in the Pammal Municipal area and is developing the park site as a recreational facility at a cost of Rs 25 Lakhs. The Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 require the authorities to collect and dispose of solid waste generated within the municipal area using various permissible methods. The Bio-Degradable and non-biodegradable waste should be collected separately at source and properly disposed of. The non-biodegradable materials are to be handled by Solid Waste Management facilities wherein the solid waste is properly handled for reuse and recycling. The court order emphasizes the importance of proper waste management and disposal to prevent unnecessary accumulation and ensure proper reuse of waste.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the use of a park site for a micro compost plant. The municipality argues that due to urbanization and the increase in waste generation, there is a need for proper waste management facilities. The court notes that waste management is a challenge faced by municipalities and that they must balance the need for parks and dumping yards. The court also observes that a small portion of the park being used for the compost yard cannot be considered an encroachment. The court orders that only segregated bio-degradable waste will be taken to the micro compost centre and that the park will be maintained properly. The court also notes that the petitioner has an alternate remedy available to approach the National Green Tribunal.

The court order states that the municipality cannot take the garbage to another place as it may be objected to by residents in that area. The petitioners must use the compost yard for removing the garbage and ensure that the area is litter-free and regular fogging operations are being taken care of by the municipality. The court suggests that the municipality should provide degradable wastage disposal bags to each house. The court also warns that if any defects are pointed out by residents with regard to the improper maintenance of the compost yard, the officers will be liable to pay costs and face prosecution as per law. The court also emphasizes that the interest and welfare of society is paramount and that the present writ petition filed by the petitioner/sangam is without merit. The court opines that the garbage that is dumped in and around the layout and playground will be collected by the workers of Micro Composting Facility.

The court order states that a Micro Compost Yard will be set up in a playground to collect and segregate bio-degradable and non-bio-degradable waste. The municipality has assured that the composting will be carried out in a hermetically constructed tub to prevent any spread of decaying matter or leachate into the surrounding environment. The court emphasizes the importance of open spaces and the need to dispose of waste in a scientific manner to avoid environmental hazards. The court finds no reason to interfere with the impugned tender notice published by the municipality for the Micro Compost Yard. However, if the Micro Compost Yard is not maintained properly, the officials in charge will be dismissed from service. The court also orders the municipal authorities to ensure that the Municipal Solid Waste Management Plant/Transfer Station is cleaned twice a day to avoid mosquitoes breeding in the park. The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.

The court has dismissed the Writ Petition and there will be no order for costs. The connected miscellaneous petition is also closed. The order was given by S.M.K., J. and S.P., J. on December 11, 2018. The court order was addressed to the District Collector of Kancheepuram District and the Commissioner of Pammal Municipality, Chennai.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute over the use of
