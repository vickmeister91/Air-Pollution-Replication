The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Suriya Sweets against the State of Tamil Nadu and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority. The petitioner had been running a commercial activity in a primary residential use zone, which was found to be impermissible by an earlier order of the Division Bench of the court. The present impugned orders were passed by the first and second respondents in compliance with the earlier order.

The petitioner had contended that an application for regularization was pending, but the court rejected this argument. The court found that the petitioner was a blatant violator of the law and could not be allowed to perpetuate the violation. As a result, the writ petition was dismissed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had been operating a commercial activity in a zone that was designated for primary residential use. This was in violation of the earlier order of the Division Bench of the court, which had clearly stated that such activities were impermissible in the area.

The court also noted that the petitioner had been given ample opportunity to rectify the situation, but had failed to do so. The petitioner had been aware of the earlier order of the court and had continued to operate the commercial activity in violation of the law.

The court's decision was further strengthened by the fact that the petitioner had not made any effort to seek regularization of the activity. The court found that the petitioner's claim that an application for regularization was pending was not credible, as the petitioner had been operating the activity in violation of the law for a significant period of time.

In light of these facts, the court found that the petitioner was a blatant violator of the law and could not be allowed to perpetuate the violation. The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition was therefore justified.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder that commercial activities must be conducted in accordance with the law. Violations of zoning regulations can have serious consequences, and those who engage in such activities must be prepared to face the consequences of their actions.
