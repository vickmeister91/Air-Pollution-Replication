The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a judgment in an appeal against a decision made by a single judge. The case in question involved the revision of pay scales for Law Officers by the State Pollution Control Board, and the objections raised by the State Government. The court ultimately held that the Board had the power to determine and sanction the revised pay scale of its Law Officers without requiring further approval from the State Government.

The case began when the State Pollution Control Board revised the pay scales of its Law Officers. The State Government objected to this decision, arguing that the Board did not have the authority to make such a decision without first seeking approval from the State Government. The matter was taken to court, where a single judge of the Rajasthan High Court ruled in favor of the State Government.

However, the Board was not satisfied with this decision and decided to appeal the ruling. The appeal was heard by a division bench of the Rajasthan High Court, which ultimately overturned the decision made by the single judge.

In its ruling, the division bench held that the State Pollution Control Board was indeed empowered to determine and sanction the revised pay scale of its Law Officers without requiring further approval from the State Government. The court also set aside the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge and quashed the order passed by the State Government.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant laws and regulations governing the State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the Board had the power to determine the pay scales of its employees, including Law Officers, and that this power was not subject to the approval of the State Government.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the powers of the State Pollution Control Board with respect to the revision of pay scales for its employees. The decision also highlights the importance of carefully analyzing the relevant laws and regulations when making decisions that may be subject to legal challenge.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the State Pollution Control Board and its Law Officers. The court's ruling affirms the Board's authority to determine the pay scales of its employees, and provides clarity on the issue for future cases. The appeal was allowed with no order as to costs.
