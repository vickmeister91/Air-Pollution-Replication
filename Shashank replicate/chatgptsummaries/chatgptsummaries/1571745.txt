The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Babulal Chakubhai against an order of externment passed against him by the District Magistrate, Central Saurashtra, under Section 47(B) of the Saurashtra District Police (Amendment) Act, 1951. The petitioner challenged the order on various grounds, including that the material allegations against him were vague and lacked sufficient particulars, the inquiry was ex parte, and the evidence relied upon was perjured. However, the court rejected all the contentions and dismissed the petition.

The case revolves around the concept of externment, which is a legal process that allows the authorities to remove a person from a particular area or district for a specified period. The Saurashtra District Police (Amendment) Act, 1951, provides for the externment of persons who are deemed to be a threat to public safety and order. Section 47(B) of the Act empowers the District Magistrate to pass an order of externment against such persons after conducting an inquiry.

In this case, Babulal Chakubhai was externed from the Central Saurashtra district on the grounds that he was involved in various criminal activities and was a threat to public safety. Chakubhai challenged the order on several grounds, including that the material allegations against him were vague and lacked sufficient particulars, the inquiry was ex parte, and the evidence relied upon was perjured.

The court examined each of these contentions in detail and found them to be without merit. With regard to the allegation that the material allegations against Chakubhai were vague and lacked sufficient particulars, the court noted that the order of externment contained specific details of the criminal activities that Chakubhai was alleged to have been involved in. The court also observed that the order was based on a report submitted by the police, which contained detailed information about Chakubhai's criminal activities.

The court also rejected the contention that the inquiry was ex parte. The petitioner had argued that he was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses who had deposed against him. However, the court noted that the petitioner had been given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, but he had chosen not to do so. The court also observed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the witnesses had deposed falsely.

Finally, the court rejected the contention that the evidence relied upon was perjured. The petitioner had argued that the witnesses who had deposed against him had given false evidence. However, the court noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the witnesses had deposed falsely. The court also observed that the police report contained independent corroboration of the witnesses' evidence.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the petition and upheld the order of externment passed against Babulal Chakubhai. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing specific and detailed information in orders of externment, as well as the need for a fair and impartial inquiry process. It also underscores the importance of producing evidence to support any allegations made in court, as unsupported allegations are unlikely to be given much weight by the court.
