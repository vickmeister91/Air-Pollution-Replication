The case of Rakesh Kumar Yadav, who filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., revolves around the seizure of his truck bearing registration no. UP64-T9600. The police had seized the vehicle after finding that sand was being excavated from the bank of Sone river, which is protected for the Sone Ghadayal, and was being transported by the vehicle. The petitioner claimed that he is the registered owner of the vehicle and has a valid permit to transport sand. 

The Court of JMFC, Deosar District Singrauli, and the Ist Addl. Sessions Judge, Deosar District Singrauli, had passed an order regarding the seizure of the truck. The petitioner challenged this order and sought relief from the Court.

If no proceedings have been initiated, the vehicle should be released to the petitioner on certain terms and conditions.
