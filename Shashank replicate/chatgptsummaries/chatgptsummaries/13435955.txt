The case in question involves a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against the accused for constructing a farm house in violation of a notification. The accused were summoned to face trial and were admitted to bail. However, after pre-charge evidence and cross-examination, the trial court found that the prosecution had failed to prove that the notification was applicable to the land of the accused and that the construction was made after the issuance of the notification. As a result, the accused were acquitted of the charge.

Following the acquittal, the complainant filed an application seeking leave to file an appeal. However, the court found no ground to grant the relief prayed for and dismissed the application. This decision was based on the fact that the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that the accused had violated the notification.

The case highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims made in court. In this instance, the prosecution was unable to prove that the accused had violated the notification, which ultimately led to their acquittal. It also demonstrates the need for individuals and organizations to be aware of the laws and regulations that apply to their activities, in order to avoid potential legal issues.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of due diligence and proper legal representation in navigating the complexities of the legal system. While the accused were ultimately acquitted, the case serves as a cautionary tale for those who may be tempted to violate regulations or laws without fully understanding the potential consequences.
