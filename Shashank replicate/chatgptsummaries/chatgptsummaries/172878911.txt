The Bombay High Court has been considering a common question of law in three writ petitions filed by autonomous colleges and institutions in Maharashtra. The question is whether these institutions are subject to the Fees Regulating Authority's jurisdiction and whether the authority can regulate their fees. The court has reserved judgment on the matter.

The three petitions filed by autonomous colleges/institutions in Maharashtra question whether they are governed by the Maharashtra Unaided Private Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fees) Act, 2015. The court found a prima facie case of conflict between the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 and the 2016 Universities Act and issued notice to the learned Advocate General. The Petitioners have approached the court seeking a declaration that the Regulation Act of 2015 is not applicable to them.

Another petition seeks complete financial autonomy for autonomous colleges/institutions under the Maharashtra Universities Act, 1994. The petitioner argues that the legislative intent was to grant complete autonomy in administrative, academic, and financial matters to autonomous colleges/institutions. The petitioner also argues that the provisions of the Regulation Act of 2015 cannot be applied to autonomous colleges/institutions as they have been granted complete autonomy. The State argues that the autonomy granted is subject to the provisions of the 1994 Universities Act and the recommendations of the Academic Council and Management Council. The court will have to determine whether the autonomy granted is complete or subject to regulation.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Regulation Act of 2015 on autonomous institutions and colleges. The order states that the Regulation Act of 2015 is a law governing a limited field of regulating admissions and fees in professional unaided colleges, while the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts are general laws concerning the affairs of universities. The court finds that the autonomy granted to autonomous institutions cannot be taken away by the Regulation Act of 2015, and that there is no conflict between the Acts regarding fee fixation and regulation.

The court order discusses various sections of the Universities Act, including the definition of "autonomous college" and the process for granting autonomous status to institutions. It also outlines the establishment of a Fee Fixation Committee to determine tuition fees and charges for courses and programs offered by universities, colleges, and recognized institutions. The committee is composed of various members, including a retired Vice-Chancellor or educationist as Chairperson, the Dean of the faculty concerned, and a finance expert nominated by the Vice-Chancellor.

The court order discusses the process for fee fixation and the autonomy of colleges and institutions. The fee fixation committee will evaluate additional facilities provided by colleges and their decision will be final. Autonomous colleges and institutions have the power to prescribe their own courses of study, teaching methods, and hold examinations. They can also raise their own resources through various means and must use them solely for the purpose of the institution's development.

The court order discusses the regulations and procedures for determining the reasonableness of fees levied by private professional educational institutions in Maharashtra. The Fees Regulating Authority is responsible for approving fee proposals and ensuring they do not amount to profiteering or charging of capitation fees. The management of unaided institutions must submit details of proposed fees and budgets for approval, and the Fees Regulating Authority must communicate its decision within 120 days.

The court order discusses the conflict between two laws regarding the regulation of fees for unaided private professional educational institutions. The petitioners argue that the special law regarding autonomous institutions should take precedence, while the respondents argue that the general law should prevail. The court cites previous cases and principles of law to determine that a general law will not necessarily repeal a special law, and that the two laws can coexist as long as there is no irreconcilable conflict. The court ultimately rules in favor of the respondents, stating that the Regulation Act of 2015 should prevail over the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts.

The court order discusses the principle of implied repeal and how it applies to conflicting laws. The court must determine if there is a conflict between the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts and the Regulation Act of 2015, and if so, which statute should prevail. The court must scrutinize the terms of all the enactments and consider their true meaning and effect, as well as their objects and purposes.

The court order states that private educational institutions are entitled to have their own fee structure, but there can be no profiteering or charging of capitation fees. Each institute must place its proposed fee structure before a committee headed by a retired High Court Judge, who will decide whether the fees proposed are justified and not profiteering or charging capitation fees. The committee can approve the fee structure or propose another fee. Once fees are fixed by the committee, the institute cannot charge any other amount over and above the fixed fees.

The court order directs committees responsible for setting fee structures for educational institutions to be more sensitive and act reasonably with due regard for the realities of each institution. They should refrain from generalizing fee structures and instead go into the accounts, schemes, plans, and budgets of individual institutions to determine an ideal and reasonable fee structure.

In conclusion, the court order discusses the various laws and regulations governing the autonomy and fee structure of autonomous colleges and institutions in Maharashtra. The court finds that the Regulation Act of 2015 should prevail over the 1994 and 2016 Universities Acts in terms of regulating fees for unaided private professional
