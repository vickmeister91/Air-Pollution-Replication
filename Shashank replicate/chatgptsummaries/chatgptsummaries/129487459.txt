The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently dismissed a petition filed by M/S Essar Power M.P. Limited against an order issued by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The order had imposed certain conditions on the company, including a direction to deposit Rs. 10 crore as environmental compensation. The court did not comment on the issue of jurisdiction, stating that it may be dealt with by the National Green Tribunal. The court dismissed the petition for want of an efficacious alternative remedy.

The case pertains to the operation of a thermal power plant by M/S Essar Power M.P. Limited in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh. The Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board had issued an order on 22nd December 2020, directing the company to deposit Rs. 10 crore as environmental compensation for non-compliance with environmental norms. The order also directed the company to take certain measures to mitigate the environmental impact of its operations.

M/S Essar Power M.P. Limited challenged the order before the Madhya Pradesh High Court, contending that the order was passed without jurisdiction and in violation of principles of natural justice. The company argued that the National Green Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction to deal with such matters and that the order was passed without giving the company an opportunity to be heard.

The Madhya Pradesh High Court, however, dismissed the petition on the ground of alternative remedy. The court held that the National Green Tribunal was the appropriate forum to deal with the issue of jurisdiction and that the company could approach the tribunal for redressal of its grievances. The court also observed that the company had not exhausted its remedies before the appellate authority and that the petition was premature.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of alternative remedies in environmental matters. The court's approach is in line with the principle of sustainable development, which requires a balance between economic development and environmental protection. The court's decision also highlights the need for strict compliance with environmental norms and the consequences of non-compliance.

The case also raises important questions about the role of the judiciary in environmental matters. While the court did not comment on the issue of jurisdiction, it is clear that the judiciary has an important role to play in ensuring that environmental norms are enforced and that violators are held accountable. The court's decision also highlights the need for a robust legal framework to deal with environmental issues and the importance of effective implementation of such laws.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's decision to dismiss the petition filed by M/S Essar Power M.P. Limited against the order of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board is a significant development in environmental jurisprudence. The court's decision underscores the importance of alternative remedies in environmental matters and highlights the need for strict compliance with environmental norms. The case also raises important questions about the role of the judiciary in environmental matters and the need for a robust legal framework to deal with such issues.
