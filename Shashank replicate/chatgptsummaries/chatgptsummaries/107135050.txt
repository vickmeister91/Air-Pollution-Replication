The court order issued by Yashwant Kumar, the District & Sessions Judge (West) at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi, pertains to an appeal filed by Sh. Dalip Kumar against an eviction order passed by the Estate Officer, DSIIDC Ltd. The premises in question was allotted to Sh. Narain Dass by DSIIDC, and the appellant is the appointed GPA holder of Sh. Narain Dass. The appellant argued that the Estate Officer violated the principles of natural justice and that he is not an unauthorized occupant. However, the respondent did not file a reply to the appeal.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court found that the original allottee, Sh. Narain Dass, violated the terms and conditions of the hire-purchase agreement. As a result, the appellant, Sh. Dalip Kumar, who is the GPA holder of Sh. Narain Dass, is in unauthorized occupation of the premises. The court dismissed the appeal filed by Sh. Dalip Kumar.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the original allottee, Sh. Narain Dass, had violated the terms and conditions of the hire-purchase agreement. The appellant, Sh. Dalip Kumar, who is the GPA holder of Sh. Narain Dass, argued that the Estate Officer violated the principles of natural justice and that he is not an unauthorized occupant. However, the court found that the appellant's arguments were not valid and that he is indeed in unauthorized occupation of the premises.
