The first court order pertains to a petition filed by Anil Govindbhai Chudasama under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner sought a writ, direction, and order to restrain the respondents from preventing him from carrying out agricultural activity on his land and from constructing a house for himself and his cattle on the said farm. The land in question was allotted to a Maldhari, Rabari Raja Amara, in 1982, and was treated as new tenure land, which cannot be transferred without prior permission of the Revenue Department. The heirs of Rabari Raja Amara applied for permission to convert the land from new tenure to old tenure by paying necessary premium under Section 43 of the Tenancy Act in 1998, and the Revenue Authority passed an order to that effect on 5.5.1998. The necessary entry was also mutated in the revenue record. The heirs of Rabari Raja Amara sold the said land to Govindbhai Malabhai Chudasama by a registered deed, and thereafter the said land was purchased by Anil Govindbhai Chudasama.

However, the respondents were obstructing the petitioner from carrying out agricultural activity on the said land and restraining the petitioner from putting up any construction of houses for the petitioner and cattle on the said farm. The respondents claimed that the land in question was given/allotted to Maldharies who were residing in the said forest for their rehabilitation, and instead of that, said Maldharies are selling the said land and again start residing in Gir area, and that such a transfer is absolutely illegal. The respondents directed the petitioner not to use the said land and not to cultivate the land in question.

The court appointed an Amicus Curiae to assist the court and to visit the Sanctuary and submit a report. The report stated that the land in question is in the reserved forests as per the Notification of the Government of Gujarat dated 15.4.1971 and Wildlife Sanctuary dated 18.9.1965. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the land in question was part of the Gir Sanctuary, which was created to provide sufficient food for lions by increasing the population of herbivores. The government sanctioned a scheme for the development of the sanctuary, which included resettling families and declaring certain areas as reserved forests. Therefore, the plot of land in question, which was illegally transferred to the petitioner, cannot be used for non-forest activities or construction.

The second court order discusses the development of the Gir Sanctuary in India. The sanctuary was created to provide sufficient food for lions by increasing the population of herbivores. The government sanctioned a scheme for the development of the sanctuary, which included resettling families and declaring certain areas as reserved forests. The court found that a plot of land in the sanctuary, which was illegally transferred to the petitioner, cannot be used for non-forest activities or construction. The court also directed authorities to investigate and take appropriate action against the transfer of other plots in the sanctuary to non-Maldharis.

In summary, both court orders pertain to the Gir Sanctuary in India. The first order deals with a petition filed by Anil Govindbhai Chudasama seeking permission to carry out agricultural activity and construct a house on a plot of land that was illegally transferred to him. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the land in question was part of the Gir Sanctuary and cannot be used for non-forest activities or construction. The second order discusses the development of the sanctuary and directs authorities to investigate and take appropriate action against the transfer of other plots in the sanctuary to non-Maldharis. Overall, the court orders emphasize the importance of preserving the sanctuary and its ecosystem.
