The Madras High Court recently heard appeals by the Commissioner of Central Excise & Service Tax against a common final order passed by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal. The question at hand was whether an activity carried out in compliance with a statutory requirement under a particular act alone would make the said activity/service as input service under Rule 2(1) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 especially when such service/activity has no nexus in or integral connection to the manufacture of final product.

The Tribunal referred to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of CCE, LTU, Chennai Vs. Rane TRW Steering Systems Ltd. and held that the service tax paid in all those cases would fall within the definition of 'input services' and that the assessee is entitled to the benefit thereof. The court order states that a company is entitled to claim the tax paid on eco-friendly maintenance of their factory premises as an input service cost of the final product. The Tribunal had already decided in favor of the company and the appeal filed by the Revenue was dismissed. No costs were awarded.

The case revolves around the interpretation of Rule 2(1) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004. The rule defines input service as any service used by a provider of output service for providing an output service. The question before the court was whether a service carried out in compliance with a statutory requirement under a particular act alone would make the said activity/service as input service under Rule 2(1) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 especially when such service/activity has no nexus in or integral connection to the manufacture of final product.

The court referred to the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of CCE, LTU, Chennai Vs. Rane TRW Steering Systems Ltd. In that case, the court held that the service tax paid on the services of security, housekeeping, and canteen provided by the assessee to its employees would fall within the definition of 'input services' and that the assessee is entitled to the benefit thereof.

The court held that the service tax paid on the eco-friendly maintenance of the factory premises would fall within the definition of 'input services' and that the assessee is entitled to the benefit thereof.

The court also held that the service of eco-friendly maintenance of the factory premises has a nexus with the manufacture of the final product. The court held that the eco-friendly maintenance of the factory premises is necessary for the smooth functioning of the manufacturing process and that it contributes to the quality of the final product.

The court held that the service of eco-friendly maintenance of the factory premises is not a statutory requirement under any particular act. The court held that the service is a voluntary service undertaken by the assessee for the betterment of the environment and that it is in the interest of the assessee to undertake such service.

The court held that the service of eco-friendly maintenance of the factory premises is an input service under Rule 2(1) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 and that the assessee is entitled to claim the tax paid on such service as an input service cost of the final product.
