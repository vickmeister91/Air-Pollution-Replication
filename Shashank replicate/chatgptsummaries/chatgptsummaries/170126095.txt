The court order pertains to three civil writ petitions filed by retired employees of Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) who had taken voluntary retirement under various schemes introduced by HCL. The petitioners had demanded entitlement for revision of their pay scales as they were all regular workmen on the rolls of HCL as on 01.11.1997. However, as the petitioners were not given the arrears under the pay settlement effective from 01.11.1997, the petitioners demanded to release the same which was rejected by the respondent conveying a letter to the Hindustan Copper Limited, Khetri Jhujhunu i.e. the petitioner-Union informing vide letter dated 12.02.2008 that in pursuance of the Supreme Court order and other Court rulings, employees who had opted for VRS scheme were not entitled to any arrears arising out of subsequent pay revision. The court has reserved its order on the matter.

The court order pertains to a settlement agreement between Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) and its regular workmen. The settlement covers the period from 01.11.1997 to 31.10.2007 and entitles all regular workmen who were on the rolls of HCL as of 01.11.1997 to the benefits of the settlement, subject to certain conditions. The court is examining whether the benefits of the settlement should be extended to employees who voluntarily retired after 01.11.1997, as they were denied the benefits of the settlement. The court examines the terms of the settlement and the entitlement of voluntary retired employees to the benefits of the settlement.

The court order discusses various cases where the entitlement of benefits to employees who have taken voluntary retirement was questioned. The court applies the principle of literal construction and concludes that the settlement granting pay revision does not distinguish between existing employees and ex-employees, nor does it differentiate between employees who have retired voluntarily and those who have retired ordinarily. Therefore, the court rules that the voluntary retired employees are entitled to the benefits of the pay revision.

The court order discusses various cases and states that each case must be decided on its own facts. In the present case, the company had promised to grant the benefit of pay revision to employees who had retired under the voluntary retirement scheme. The court found that denying this benefit to the petitioners was illegal and arbitrary, and violated Section 18(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act. The court ordered that the benefits be released to the employees individually, and their claims be examined in terms of the settlement. The voluntary retirement benefits should be revised based on the benefits to which the concerned employee was entitled.
