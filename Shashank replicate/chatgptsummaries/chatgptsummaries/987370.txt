The two court orders discussed in this summary both concern disputes over the dismissal of libel suits due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain a fresh summons within three months of unsuccessful service. In the first case, Shaw & Co. v. B. Shamaldas & Co., the defendant firm sought dismissal of the suit under Order 9, Rule 5 of the Civil P.C. The plaintiff argued that this rule did not apply to the Original Side of the High Court and that the defendant had waived the limitation of three months by entering appearance in the suit. However, the court ultimately found that Order 9, Rule 5 did apply to the Original Side and that the defendant had not waived the limitation, leading to the dismissal of the suit.

In the second case, the plaintiff also failed to obtain a fresh summons within three months of unsuccessful service, as required by Order 9, Rule 5 of the Civil P.C. The defendants argued that the suit should be dismissed as a result, and the court ultimately agreed, dismissing the suit and ordering the plaintiff to pay costs. The order also addressed several defenses raised by the defendants, including the argument that the defendants waived their right to seek dismissal by entering appearance in the suit.

Order 9, Rule 5 of the Civil P.C. states that if a writ of summons is returned unserved, the plaintiff must apply for a fresh summons within three months, failing which the suit will be dismissed. This rule applies to both the Original Side and the Appellate Side of the High Court. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that cases are not kept pending indefinitely due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendant.

In the first case, the plaintiff argued that Order 9, Rule 5 did not apply to the Original Side of the High Court. The Original Side of the High Court refers to the jurisdiction of the High Court to hear cases that originate within its territorial jurisdiction. The plaintiff argued that since the libel suit was filed on the Original Side of the High Court, Order 9, Rule 5 did not apply. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that there was no reason to exclude the Original Side from the operation of Order 9, Rule 5.

The plaintiff in the first case also argued that the defendant had waived the limitation of three months by entering appearance in the suit. The defendant had entered appearance in the suit and had not raised the issue of the plaintiff's failure to obtain a fresh summons within three months until much later. The plaintiff argued that this amounted to a waiver of the limitation. However, the court rejected this argument as well, stating that the defendant had not waived the limitation and that the plaintiff was still required to comply with Order 9, Rule 5.

In the second case, the defendants raised several defenses in addition to the argument that the suit should be dismissed due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain a fresh summons within three months. One of the defenses was that the defendants had waived their right to seek dismissal by entering appearance in the suit. The court rejected this defense, stating that the defendants had not waived their right to seek dismissal and that the plaintiff was still required to comply with Order 9, Rule 5.

The court in both cases ultimately found that the plaintiff had failed to comply with Order 9, Rule 5 and that the suits should be dismissed. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that cases are not kept pending indefinitely due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendant. By requiring the plaintiff to obtain a fresh summons within three months of unsuccessful service, the rule ensures that cases are either resolved or dismissed in a timely manner.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary both concern disputes over the dismissal of libel suits due to the plaintiff's failure to obtain a fresh summons within three months of unsuccessful service. The court in both cases ultimately found that the plaintiff had failed to comply with Order 9, Rule 5 and that the suits should be dismissed. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that cases are not kept pending indefinitely due to the plaintiff's failure to serve the defendant.
