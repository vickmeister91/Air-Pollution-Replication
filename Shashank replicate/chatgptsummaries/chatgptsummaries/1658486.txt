The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over land ownership and classification in various villages and hamlets in the Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh, India. The orders examine various statutory provisions, including the Andhra Pradesh Estates Abolition Act, the A.P. (A.A) Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, the Andhra Pradesh Record of Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, the A.P. Forest Act, and the Forest Conservation Act, among others.

In one order, the court examines a writ petition challenging the placement of land in Yerranagavari Palle village and in paimash Nos. 120 to 139 of Penubalakala hamlet in the Prohibitory Book Register. The petitioner seeks to implement G.O.Ms. No. 439 dated 13-3-1957 and to include their name in the revenue records as the owner of these lands. The court examines various documents and orders related to the land, including the A.P. Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, and ultimately dismisses the writ petition on preliminary grounds. The order also discusses various revision petitions and representations filed by the petitioner and others related to the land.

In another order, the court discusses a dispute over land ownership in Peddakapalli village. The petitioner claims that certain lands were her personal property and not part of the government's estate, and therefore should not have been included in the Prohibitory Order Book. The respondents argue that the lands are covered by forests and belong to the government, and have been in their possession since at least 1959. The court notes that the lands in question were surveyed in 1957-58 and classified as government lands, and that the joint inspection conducted by Forest and Revenue Officials revealed that the lands claimed by the petitioner mostly fall inside the Reserve Forest to an extent of Ac.1175.00 cts except for a small extent of Ac. 100.00 cts falling outside the Reserve Forest. The court ultimately rules in favor of the respondents, stating that the lands are covered by forests and belong to the government.

In yet another order, the court examines a dispute over land ownership between the petitioner and the government. The petitioner claims that the land in question is her personal property and not part of the Reserve Forest Area, while the government argues that the land falls within the forest area and is therefore under their control. The court examines the history of the Zamindari Abolition system and the relevant statutory provisions, and ultimately rules in favor of the petitioner, ordering that her name be entered in the village records as the owner of the land. The government argues that the petitioner's claim is barred by laches and that the land is classified as assessed waste (dry) and is therefore protected under the Forest Conservation Act.

In another order, the court discusses a dispute over forest lands and the petitioner's claim to them. The court notes that the forest lands are under the control of the forest department and that the petitioner had not made any effort to claim the land or act upon it until after the revision before the Commissioner of Survey and Settlement of Land Records. The court also notes that the petitioner's claim is unsustainable and that she had lost her claims through another party. The court cites various statutory provisions and the A.P. (A.A) Estates (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Act, 1948, which provided for the repeal of the permanent settlements and the acquisition of landholders' rights in permanent estates. The court ultimately concludes that the petitioner is not entitled to the forest lands and that the relationship between landholder and ryot has been extinguished.

The court orders also discuss various sections and standing orders related to land classification, record of rights, and forest conservation. The orders clarify that lands within an estate are subject to ryotwari patta, while personal properties of a zamindar fall outside the estate and do not require a patta. The orders also note that lands within a reserve forest are subject to restrictions under the A.P. Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act, and that the entry of lands in the prohibitory order book is only required for reserved lands. The orders also address objections raised by the respondents and clarify that G.O.Ms. No. 439 dated 13-03-1957 remains in force.

The court orders recognize that all forest areas, regardless of ownership or classification, fall under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, for conservation purposes. The orders also note that even private forests are subject to the Act, and non-forest activity must be stopped. The orders also discuss the jurisdiction of the Settlement Officer and the Board of Revenue under the Estates Abolition Act, which is limited to determining whether lands are part of an estate or not. The court notes that mutation of entries in revenue records does not confer title, and disputed questions of fact may be examined in proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India at the discretion of the court. The petitioner must establish her title over the forest lands in question before seeking relief.

The court orders also discuss the jurisdiction and discretion of the court in cases where there are disputed questions of fact. The court has the jurisdiction to try issues of fact and law in a petition under Article 226, but the exercise of jurisdiction is discretionary
