The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by M/S Devi Enterprises against the Environmental Officer and other government agencies. The petitioner sought to quash a closure order issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) for operating without obtaining the necessary consent and violating noise pollution standards. The court found that the order had not been implemented despite using the word "forthwith" and that the KSPCB had failed to enforce its own orders. The court also noted that the KSPCB could have filed a complaint, but had not done so.

The court notes that this is a serious issue and orders the KSPCB to file a complaint against the officers responsible for not implementing an order to curb pollution. The court emphasizes the importance of clean air and a peaceful living environment and imposes a cost of Rs. 10,000 on the petitioner.
