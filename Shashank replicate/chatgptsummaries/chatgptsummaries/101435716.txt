The three court orders discussed in this article all relate to the production of documents and statements during criminal proceedings. In the first case, the petitioner sought to annul an order passed by the revisional court, which had declined to interfere with an order passed by the trial court rejecting the petitioner's application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.) to issue summons to a police officer for production of documents. The petitioner had made an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to summon statements of two alleged independent witnesses recorded during investigation and some of the documents. The trial court declined the petitioner's prayer, and the revisional court declined to interfere in the matter. The petitioner argued that the order impugned passed by the revisional court is dehors the mandate of Section 91 Cr.P.C.

The court examined the nature of the power conferred on the court or any officer in charge of a police station under Section 91 Cr.P.C. and held that the power is within the sole discretion of the trial court. The court also held that whether a particular document should be summoned or not is essentially in the discretion of the trial court. The court noted that the High Court should not interfere with the discretion of the trial courts in summoning documents unless there are very good reasons to do so. The court cited previous cases to support its decision and concluded that the accused's request is not necessary or desirable for the trial.

In the second case, the court order discusses a request made by the accused to summon certain documents and statements for the purpose of the trial. The court notes that the accused does not have an absolute right to the documents and that the prosecution is only obliged to submit the statements of witnesses it plans to call. The court cites previous cases to establish that the accused does not have an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file and that the necessity and desirability of producing documents must be seen in the context of the purpose of the proceedings. The court ultimately decides not to interfere with the trial court's order, which allows the petitioner to examine independent witnesses as defense witnesses.

In the third case, the court order discusses the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows for the production of necessary or desirable documents during an investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings. The court cites previous cases to establish that the accused does not have an indefeasible legal right to claim every document of the police file and that the necessity and desirability of producing documents must be seen in the context of the purpose of the proceedings. The court ultimately decides not to interfere with the trial court's order, which allows the petitioner to examine independent witnesses as defense witnesses.

In all three cases, the court emphasizes the discretion of the trial court in deciding whether to summon documents or statements. The court notes that the accused does not have an absolute right to the documents and that the necessity and desirability of producing documents must be seen in the context of the purpose of the proceedings. The court also cites previous cases to support its decisions and emphasizes the importance of not interfering with the discretion of the trial courts unless there are very good reasons to do so. Overall, these court orders provide guidance on the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the discretion of trial courts in summoning documents and statements during criminal proceedings.
