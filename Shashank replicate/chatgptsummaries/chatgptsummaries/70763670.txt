The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, in which the petitioner had challenged the rejection of his representation against a stone crusher being established in a different village than the one for which the license was granted. The court held that since the petitioner had not challenged the no objection certificate granted to the respondent, his representation was liable to be rejected. The court also granted the petitioner the liberty to approach the appellate authority under Section 31 of the U.P. (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The case pertains to a stone crusher that was granted a license to operate in a particular village. However, the petitioner alleged that the stone crusher was being operated in a different village, which was causing pollution and other environmental hazards. The petitioner had filed a representation with the authorities, seeking the cancellation of the license granted to the stone crusher. However, the representation was rejected by the authorities, following which the petitioner approached the High Court.

The petitioner had contended that the establishment of the stone crusher in a different village than the one for which the license was granted was illegal and in violation of the provisions of the U.P. (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner had also alleged that the stone crusher was causing pollution and other environmental hazards, which were adversely affecting the health and well-being of the residents of the village.

The High Court, however, rejected the petitioner's contentions and held that since the petitioner had not challenged the no objection certificate granted to the respondent, his representation was liable to be rejected. The court observed that the no objection certificate was a crucial document, which had been granted by the authorities after due consideration of all the relevant factors. The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the establishment of the stone crusher in a different village than the one for which the license was granted was illegal or in violation of any law.

The court further held that the petitioner had the liberty to approach the appellate authority under Section 31 of the U.P. (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court observed that the appellate authority was the appropriate forum to adjudicate on the issues raised by the petitioner and to determine whether the establishment of the stone crusher in a different village than the one for which the license was granted was legal or not.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner challenging the rejection of his representation against a stone crusher being established in a different village than the one for which the license was granted. The court held that since the petitioner had not challenged the no objection certificate granted to the respondent, his representation was liable to be rejected. The court also granted the petitioner the liberty to approach the appellate authority under Section 31 of the U.P. (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court's decision highlights the importance of challenging all relevant documents and certificates while filing a representation or petition before the court.
