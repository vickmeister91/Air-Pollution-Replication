The National Green Tribunal received an application from Mr. Vitthal Gopichand Bhungase, a fisherman from Dusalgaon, Tal.: Gangakhed, Distt: Parbhani, against The Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Ltd., Ratnakar Manikrao Gutte, The State of Maharashtra, The Secretary, The Collector, The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and The Executive Engineer. The applicant sought strict actions against the respondents for their roles and involvements in creating environmental damage, releasing industrial wastes, molasses, and chemical mixed water, and spreading pollutants in the Mazalgaon Right Canal and Mannath Lake. The applicant also requested that necessary legal action be taken against the respondents as per the law and that a fine be imposed on the respondents for making pollution and supporting anti-environmental actions.

The court order discusses a case involving the Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Ltd. The Pollution Control System at the Industry is said to be performing efficiently and there is no probability of any accidental discharges. However, in June 2010, there was spillage of molasses from the molasses storage tank No.1 of the Industry, which caused environmental damage to the surrounding area including the canal and Mannat lake. The court holds that the Industry committed gross negligence resulting in the spillage and is liable to restore environmental damages caused due to the incident. The Polluter Pay's Principal is applicable, and the Industry must pay for the cost of pollution abatement, environment damage recovery, incident management, and compensation costs for the victims of the incident.

The court order pertains to an application filed under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, regarding the pollution of Mannat lake due to the indiscriminate effluent discharge by an industry. The court frames three issues for adjudication, including whether the application is barred by limitation of time, whether the lake is polluted causing loss of fisheries and undesirable water quality, and whether the applicant has made out a case of loss of fisheries due to the deteriorated water quality. The court finds that the application is not barred by limitation and can be adjudicated by the tribunal. The court also notes that there have been regular incidents of untreated effluent discharges by the industry, and that the pollution control system at the industry is performing efficiently, except for the incident of June-July 2010.

The court order discusses a dispute over pollution caused by a distillery unit in an industry. The industry claims to have a zero discharge system, but the applicant alleges that the effluent is contaminating a nearby lake. The court considers evidence from various parties, including the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and the Irrigation Department, and finds that the industry has invested in pollution control measures and is in compliance with regulations. However, the court also notes that there have been complaints about pollution and contamination of the lake, and that the industry has not paid for the environmental damages caused. The court orders the industry to pay Rs. 16,33,000/- with interest to the Irrigation Department for the loss of water sources.

The court order partially allows Application No.30/2013 (WZ) and directs Respondent No.1 to comply with consented standards and bear the costs of replenishing water in Mannat lake and environmental damages. The Respondent No.1-Industry is also liable to pay for investigation costs and environment restitution costs. The total amount will be recovered from the Rs. 50,00,000/- deposited by the Industry, and the balance amount may be refunded to Respondent-1. The application is disposed of with no costs.

The court order directs the Gangakhed Sugar and Energy Ltd. to compensate the applicant and its members for the loss sustained by them due to pollution in Mannath Lake and to constitute an expert committee to finalize the actual loss sustained. The order also grants an injunction to prevent any person or organization from throwing waste or discharging industrial wastes into the Mazalgaon Right Canal and Mannath Lake. The application alleges non-compliance of environmental norms by the industry and non-performance of obligations by regulatory and enforcing agencies. The applicant claims to be from the fishermen community and living on the earnings of fishing derived from Mannat Lake. The order also provides details of the respondents and their submissions.

The court order discusses the issue of apportioning responsibility for pollution and how polluters should pay for the damage caused. The difficulty in assessing payment for ecological damage is highlighted, as monetary compensation may not fully make up for the loss of resources. The importance of the Precautionary Principle over the Polluter Pays Principle is advocated. The case in question involves damage to Mannat Lake and loss of livelihood for local fishermen. The court finds no credible evidence of damage to fisheries and therefore denies compensation to the applicant. The court orders the respondent to assist the local fishermen community through CSR activities. The cost of restoration of the environment is estimated at Rs.16,33,000/- along with 6% p.a. from the date of the bill of demand till the date of payment.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this article pertain to various cases of environmental damage caused by industries in the Gangakhed area of Maharashtra. The court has found that industries have been responsible for pollution and contamination of lakes and canals, and have not paid for the environmental damages caused. The court has ordered industries to pay for the cost of pollution abatement, environment damage
