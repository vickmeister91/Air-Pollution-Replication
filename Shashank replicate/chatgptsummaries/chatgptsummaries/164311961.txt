The court order pertains to the jurisdiction and procedures of the Permanent Lok Adalat, which is a dispute resolution mechanism in India. The Lok Adalat is guided by principles of natural justice, fairness, and equity, and its awards are final and binding on all parties. The Lok Adalat can only decide a dispute on merit if both parties consent in writing, and it cannot use coercion or pressure during conciliation proceedings. The court cites previous cases to clarify the Lok Adalat's role as a conciliator rather than an adjudicator, and emphasizes the importance of following statutory provisions and restrictions.

In one case, Reliance General Insurance Company Limited challenged an award passed by Permanent Lok Adalat (Public Utility Services) in Gurgaon. The Lok Adalat had directed the insurance company to pay a sum of Rs. 24,509/- along with interest to the claimant, Vijay Kumar, for his medical treatment. The insurance company had denied the claim, stating that it was bogus and not genuine. The court observed that Lok Adalats should function as conciliators and not as judges, and that confusion prevails regarding their jurisdiction and procedure. The court also referred to previous judgments that emphasized the need for Lok Adalats to guide and persuade parties to compromise and settle disputes.

The court order explains the meaning of "compromise" and "settlement" under Section 20 of the Act. It states that the Lok Adalat can only pass an order if a compromise or settlement is reached between the parties. The Lok Adalat can act as a conciliator to explore the possibility of a compromise or settlement, but cannot pressure the parties to arrive at a settlement or adjudicate a dispute on merit. The order also explains the procedure for pre-litigation stage references to the Permanent Lok Adalat under Sections 22A to 22E. The Permanent Lok Adalat can settle disputes related to public utility services, and parties can apply to it for settlement before going to court. The Permanent Lok Adalat can conduct conciliation proceedings and assist parties in reaching an amicable settlement. If the parties reach an agreement, the Permanent Lok Adalat shall pass an award in terms thereof. If the parties fail to reach an agreement, the Permanent Lok Adalat shall decide the dispute if it does not relate to any offence.

The court order states that the Permanent Lok Adalat can only decide a dispute on its merits if there is written consent from both parties. The order quashes and sets aside an earlier decision by the Permanent Lok Adalat in a specific case. The court also discusses the purpose of the Permanent Lok Adalat and the procedures it must follow before making a decision. The order allows the claimant to approach an appropriate forum for redressal of their grievance.

The court order emphasizes the importance of following statutory provisions and restrictions while dealing with disputes in the Permanent Lok Adalat. The Lok Adalat is not a substitute for the regular courts, but a complementary mechanism for resolving disputes. The Lok Adalat's role is to facilitate the settlement of disputes through conciliation and mediation, and not to adjudicate disputes on merit. The Lok Adalat's awards are final and binding on all parties, and there is no appeal against them. The Lok Adalat's decisions are based on the principles of natural justice, fairness, and equity, and it cannot use coercion or pressure to force parties to settle disputes.
