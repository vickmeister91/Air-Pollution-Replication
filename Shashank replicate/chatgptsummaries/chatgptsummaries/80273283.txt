A court order was issued by O.P. Gupta, an additional district judge at Tis Hazari Courts in Delhi. Unfortunately, the content of the order is not provided. However, another court order pertains to a case filed by Smt. Ishwanti Devi against MCD regarding the demolition of her property. The plaintiff claimed to be the owner of the property and alleged that the defendant intended to demolish it based on a false complaint. The defendant argued that the suit was barred under the DMC Act and that due process had been followed in issuing notices and orders.

After hearing both sides, the court found that the suit was indeed barred and should have been rejected under CPC. The appeal was dismissed, and parties were left to bear their own costs. This case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the laws and regulations in place. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to ensure that they have proper documentation and proof of ownership before making claims in court.

The court's decision in this case was based on the fact that the plaintiff's suit was barred under the DMC Act. The DMC Act, or Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, is a law that governs the functioning of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. It outlines the powers and duties of the corporation, as well as the rights and responsibilities of citizens and property owners in the city.

Under the DMC Act, the corporation has the power to issue notices and orders for the demolition of unauthorized constructions or structures that violate building codes or other regulations. Property owners who receive such notices or orders have the right to challenge them in court, but they must do so within a certain time frame and in accordance with the procedures outlined in the act.

In this case, the defendant argued that the plaintiff's suit was barred under the DMC Act because she had not followed the proper procedures for challenging the demolition order. The defendant claimed that notices and orders had been issued in accordance with the act and that the plaintiff had failed to respond or take any action within the prescribed time frame.

The court agreed with the defendant's argument and found that the plaintiff's suit should have been rejected under CPC, or the Code of Civil Procedure. The CPC is a law that governs the procedures and rules for civil cases in India. It outlines the steps that must be followed in filing and defending a case, as well as the timelines and deadlines that must be adhered to.

In this case, the court found that the plaintiff had not followed the proper procedures for challenging the demolition order and had not filed her suit within the prescribed time frame. As a result, the court dismissed the appeal and left the parties to bear their own costs.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to the laws and regulations in place. It also emphasizes the need for individuals to ensure that they have proper documentation and proof of ownership before making claims in court. While the content of the other court order issued by O.P. Gupta is not provided, it is likely that it also pertains to a case that involves similar issues of due process and adherence to the law.
