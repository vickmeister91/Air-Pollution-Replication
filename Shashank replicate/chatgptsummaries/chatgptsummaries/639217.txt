In 1947, a court order was issued in a case where the defendant, Bhondu, appealed a suit for possession. The plaintiff had previously brought a suit against Bhondu and another person for arrears of rent and ejectment, but withdrew the suit against Bhondu due to a dispute over title. The court allowed the withdrawal with the condition that the plaintiff pay Bhondu's costs within 30 days or be barred from filing a fresh suit against him. However, the costs were never paid, and the plaintiff later filed a new suit against Bhondu and others.

Bhondu argued that the previous court order barred the new suit, but the court disagreed. The court stated that the causes of action and subject-matters in the two suits were different and that the court should have put the plaintiff to election in the previous suit. The appeal was dismissed with costs.

The case highlights the importance of following court orders and paying costs within the specified time frame. Failure to do so can result in being barred from filing a fresh suit against the defendant. However, it is also important for the court to ensure that the plaintiff is given a fair chance to elect the appropriate cause of action and subject-matter in the previous suit.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder to both plaintiffs and defendants to adhere to court orders and to ensure that the court is fair in its proceedings.
