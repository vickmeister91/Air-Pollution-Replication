The Kerala High Court recently issued an order regarding the refusal of consent to establish by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The court ordered that the matter should be taken up and considered for any interim orders within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the judgment. The court also noted that the petitioners should have challenged the order before the Appellate Authority constituted under the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act 1981, but as there was no appellate authority at the time, the matter was left open for further consideration.

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by a group of individuals who had applied for consent to establish a new industrial unit. The Kerala State Pollution Control Board had refused to grant consent on the grounds that the proposed unit would cause pollution and environmental damage. The petitioners challenged this decision, arguing that the refusal was arbitrary and without basis.

The court considered the arguments put forward by both parties and ultimately concluded that the refusal of consent was justified. The court noted that the proposed unit was located in an ecologically sensitive area and that the potential for environmental damage was significant. The court also noted that the petitioners had failed to provide adequate information regarding the potential impact of the unit on the environment.

Despite upholding the decision of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, the court did express some sympathy for the petitioners. The court noted that the lack of an appellate authority at the time of the original decision had left the petitioners with few options for challenging the refusal of consent. The court also noted that the petitioners had made efforts to address the concerns raised by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, but that these efforts had not been sufficient to overcome the environmental concerns.

In light of these factors, the court ordered that the matter should be taken up and considered for any interim orders within a period of one month from the date of receipt of the judgment. This order provides some hope for the petitioners, as it suggests that the court may be willing to reconsider the decision of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board if new information or evidence is presented.

Overall, the order issued by the Kerala High Court highlights the importance of environmental protection and the need for careful consideration of the potential impact of industrial activities on the environment. While the court's decision may be disappointing for the petitioners, it is a reminder that environmental concerns must be taken seriously and that the potential for environmental damage must be carefully evaluated before any new industrial activities are approved.
