The first court order pertains to a Habeas Corpus petition filed by M. Viswanathan seeking the production of CarpanGoundar Mani, who was allegedly illegally detained by an order of detention under the Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986. The detention order was passed by the 2nd respondent and confirmed by the 1st respondent after receiving a report from the Advisory Board. The grounds for detention were that the detenu was involved in six criminal cases causing gross loss of national wealth, destruction of Red Sanders Forests, and was a source of potential danger to public wellbeing. The court order lists the details of the criminal cases and the confirmation of the detention order by the government.

The second court order pertains to the detention of a repeat offender who committed six crimes, including an offense under Section 307 of IPC. The order of detention was challenged on three grounds, including the fact that the detenu was not served with all materials in Tamil, which was the only language known to him. The court held that the detaining authority must communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu in a language that he understands to enable him to make a purposeful and effective representation. The court also held that the order of detention was passed on extraneous and irrelevant considerations, invalidating the order.

The third court order states that the detenu's right to make an effective representation against the order of detention was violated as he was not provided with a translated copy of the documents in a language known to him. The court also observed that the detaining authorities are not following the procedure contemplated under the provisions of the 1986 Act or Article 22 of the Constitution of India, resulting in most detention orders being set aside on technical grounds. The court directed the police stations to complete investigations in cases of detenue within the stipulated time and to file a charge sheet. The court also directed the Registrar (Judicial) to forward a copy of the judgment to the respondents and the Director General of Police for their perusal and to take appropriate steps in the light of the observations made.

In all three court orders, the issue of the detenu's right to make an effective representation against the order of detention was raised. The courts held that the detaining authorities must communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu in a language that he understands to enable him to make a purposeful and effective representation.
