The court heard a petition filed by Sandip Devidas Thorat against the Principal Secretary (Appeals & Hearing) and the Sub-Divisional Officer. Thorat requested that the order dated 23 April 2010, which confirmed an externment order against him, be quashed and set aside. The petitioner claimed that he was a resident of Kopargaon, Tq.Kopargaon, Dist.Ahmednagar and was issued a notice to remove himself from the boundaries of Aurangabad, Nashik, and Ahmednagar for a year. The court heard the petitioner's arguments and dismissed his appeal, confirming the order passed by the respondent no.2 on 24 December 2009. The petitioner received a copy of the order on 25 May 2010 and filed a petition for quashment of the order.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the order passed by respondent no.2, which externed the petitioner from three districts, was arbitrary and without proper consideration of the petitioner's acquittal from the crimes he was charged with. The counsel also argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner's behavior was dangerous to society. The petitioner's counsel cited a previous court case to support their argument that the order was excessive and without jurisdiction.

The court order discusses a petition challenging an externment order passed against the petitioner. The petitioner's counsel argues that the order is excessive and lacks data to support it. The respondent's counsel argues that the order was passed after due procedure and is based on sound legal footing. The court considers both arguments and notes that the petitioner was acquitted of the charges against him. However, the court ultimately upholds the externment order, stating that it is legal and proper.

The court order pertains to an appeal against an externment order passed against the petitioner under the Environment (Protection) Act and Indian Penal Code. The court found that the appellate authority did not take into account the petitioner's acquittal in one of the cases while passing the impugned order. The court also found that there was no justification for externing the petitioner from two other districts, Nashik and Aurangabad, as there was no evidence of criminal activity in those districts. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders and allowed the petitioner's appeal.

In the first court order, Sandip Devidas Thorat filed a petition to quash and set aside an externment order against him.

The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately dismissed the appeal, confirming the order passed by respondent no.2 on 24 December 2009. The petitioner received a copy of the order on 25 May 2010 and filed a petition for quashment of the order.

In the second court order, the petitioner's counsel argued that the externment order was arbitrary and lacked proper consideration of the petitioner's acquittal from the crimes he was charged with. The counsel also argued that there was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner's behavior was dangerous to society. The court considered both arguments and noted that the petitioner was acquitted of the charges against him. However, the court ultimately upheld the externment order, stating that it was legal and proper.

In the third court order, the petitioner appealed against an externment order passed against him under the Environment (Protection) Act and Indian Penal Code. The court found that the appellate authority did not take into account the petitioner's acquittal in one of the cases while passing the impugned order. The court also found that there was no justification for externing the petitioner from two other districts, Nashik and Aurangabad, as there was no evidence of criminal activity in those districts. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders and allowed the petitioner's appeal.
