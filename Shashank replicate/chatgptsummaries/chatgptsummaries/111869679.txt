The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ appeals and petitions filed by different parties in relation to issues related to forestry and industrial development in Karnataka, India. The first court order lists the parties involved in a writ appeal case, including the Range Forest Officer, Concord India Pvt Ltd, and various other companies and individuals. However, the details of the case are not provided.

The second court order lists the parties involved in two writ appeals, one filed by the Asst. Conservator of Forests and the State of Karnataka, and the other by Concord India Private Limited. The respondents include various individuals and companies represented by different advocates. The appeals seek to set aside an order passed in a writ petition and the case involves issues related to forestry and industrial development in Karnataka.

The third court order pertains to a writ appeal filed by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) against a writ petition filed by Concord India Pvt. Ltd. The KIADB had formed an industrial area called Kadugodi Industrial Area, and Concord was allotted Plot No.6 measuring 78.548 acres. After KIADB sought to resume the plot from Concord for alleged breach of terms of agreement, Concord filed a suit seeking a decree restraining KIADB from interfering with its peaceful possession. The suit was decreed, and KIADB's appeal was unsuccessful. Later, KIADB filed a suit against Concord for a judgment and decree of resumption of land, which was dismissed as settled out of court. Plot No.6 was re-allotted to Concord, and a lease-cum-sale agreement was executed in its favour. Concord obtained approval for setting up a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for IT/IT enabled services on a portion of the plot measuring 58 acres. The Range Forest Officer issued a notice stating that Concord was in unauthorized occupation of 78 acres of forest land, violating the provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act and Forest (Conservation) Act. KIADB agreed to surrender unutilized portion of Sy.No.1 of Kadugodi plantation to the Forest Department and recommended the utilized portion for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, to the Government of India. The State Government directed the Forest department to take possession of unutilized portion of Sy.No.1 of Kadugodi plantation, in exercise of powers under the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963 and Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Several major industries and public utility services were set up in the Kadugodi industrial area, and all such allottees preferred writ petitions, and the learned Single Judges had granted interim orders of stay of the impugned notices issued by the Forest department and the impugned order passed by the State Government.

The fourth court order discusses the history of the Kadugodi Plantation land in India, including its release from military control and subsequent transfer to the Rural Development Commissioner for cooperative farming. The land was later released to the Kadugodi Joint Farming Co-operative Society for cultivation, but the society became defunct and was liquidated. The State of Karnataka later declared the land an industrial area and sold it to M/s. Concord India Pvt. Ltd. However, the State Government later claimed that the land was forest land, leading to a legal dispute. The court ultimately dismissed the State Government's claims and upheld the sale of the land to M/s. Concord India Pvt. Ltd.

The fifth court order states that due to the dismissal of certain cases, two related applications do not need to be considered.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complex legal issues surrounding forestry and industrial development in Karnataka, India. The parties involved include government agencies, private companies, and individuals, and the cases involve disputes over land ownership, breach of agreements, and violations of environmental laws. The court orders provide some insight into the legal arguments and decisions made in these cases, but more information would be needed to fully understand the issues at stake.
