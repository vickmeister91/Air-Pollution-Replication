The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai's (MCGM) waste management project in Kanjur Marg, Mumbai. The project has been the subject of public interest litigation and has faced allegations of violating environmental regulations.

One court order concerns a petition by the MCGM challenging an order by the Ministry of Environment and Forest directing the demolition of a compound wall within the Coastal Regulation Zone area and the area affected by mangroves. The court reserved judgment on April 27, 2016, and pronounced the judgment on June 10, 2016. The court ordered the MCGM to explain why it has not complied with the terms and conditions of the environmental clearance (EC) dated 17 March 2009. The MCGM was directed to maintain 'status quo ante' at the site due to prima facie breaches. The present petition only concerns the legality and validity of the impugned directions contained in the order dated 4 November 2013 made by the MoEF. The challenge which survives in the present petition is only to the impugned directions for demolition of the compound wall, which extends into the area classified as CRZ and the area affected by mangroves at the said site.

Another court order discusses the construction of a compound wall by the MCGM in areas classified as Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and areas affected by mangroves without proper authorization. The MCGM argues that the CRZ notification of 2011 permits the setting up of solid waste management projects in CRZ areas, except those classified as CRZ I. The MCGM also argues that the construction of the compound wall should be considered compliance with the Municipal Solid Waste 2000 (MSW) Rules. However, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) argue that the construction is illegal and impermissible in CRZ areas and areas affected by mangroves. The court must determine whether the compound wall should be demolished or retained.

The court order pertains to a petition filed by the Control Board, Maharashtra, alleging that a dumping ground in a particular area would cause problems for local citizens. The court explored the possibility of an alternative dumping ground and ordered the government of Maharashtra to hand over 50% of a vacant and free land admeasuring 141.77 hectares to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai for use as a landfill site subject to strict observance of pollution laws. The MCGM was granted an environmental clearance to set up and operate the project on the balance area of 65.96 hectares, with special directions for the protection of mangroves at the site. The contract for setting up and operating the project was awarded to M/s. Anthony Lara Enviro Solutions Pvt. Ltd.

The court order discusses serious violations of environmental regulations by the MCGM in their waste processing project. The MCGM has adopted an alternate technology for waste processing without proper permission, constructed a compound wall around the project site that is affecting the mangroves, and is widening the road by filling up wetlands and mangroves. The report submitted by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) highlights these issues and recommends discontinuing and closing dumping sites that do not comply with regulations.

The court order pertains to a waste management project by the MCGM in Mumbai. The Pollution Control Board and the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority found the Corporation to be in violation of environmental norms. The court directs the Corporation to comply with the recommendations made by the MCZMA and for the MOEF to conduct a site inspection and file an affidavit clarifying the impact of environmental rules and the remedial measures required. The MOEF issued a show cause notice to the Corporation for violation of the terms and conditions of the environmental clearance.

The court order discusses the legal proceedings related to a project at a particular site. The National Green Tribunal had issued an order staying the operations of the project, but the High Court later stayed the NGT's order and allowed the project to continue in accordance with the Ministry of Environment and Forests' (MoEF) order. The Supreme Court later reiterated the High Court's order and directed all parties to comply with it. However, the MCGM and its contractor continued with the project without complying with the MoEF's order, which included the demolition of a compound wall. The court criticized the MCGM's conduct and emphasized the importance of complying with court orders.

The court order states that the MCGM cannot be appreciated for not complying with the condition imposed by the MoEF regarding the construction of a compound wall in areas affected by CRZ notification and mangroves. The MCGM is disentitled to any equitable reliefs as it has breached the condition and cannot be heard to contend that there was no requirement of obtaining any clearance. The court also mentions that the construction of a compound wall in the CRZ area is not a permissible activity without prior approval from the MoEF or any other authority.

The court order states that the main function of MSW processing and landfill had taken a back seat, leading to environmental degradation of wetlands and mangroves. The MoEF issued directions for the demolition of an unauthorized compound wall within the CRZ area and areas affected by mangroves. The court rejected the argument that the MoEF had not applied its mind in issuing the
