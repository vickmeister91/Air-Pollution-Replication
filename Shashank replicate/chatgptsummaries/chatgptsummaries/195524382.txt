In a recent court order, Dayaram Patel and Jammu Thakur were granted bail after being in custody since January 19, 2018, in connection with a forest crime case. The applicants were accused of violating various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act and the Indian Forest Act. However, the defense counsel argued that the applicants were innocent and falsely implicated.

After hearing both sides, the court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety each of the same amount. Additionally, the applicants were directed to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of Cr.P.C.

The decision to grant bail was likely based on several factors. Firstly, the length of time the applicants had already spent in custody may have been a consideration. Additionally, the defense counsel's argument that the applicants were innocent and falsely implicated may have carried weight with the court.

It is important to note that while bail has been granted, the case against Patel and Thakur is still ongoing. The charges against them are serious, and they will need to defend themselves in court. However, the fact that they have been granted bail means that they will be able to do so from outside of custody.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of a fair and just legal system. While the charges against Patel and Thakur are serious, they are entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. The decision to grant bail is a positive step towards ensuring that they are able to exercise these rights.
