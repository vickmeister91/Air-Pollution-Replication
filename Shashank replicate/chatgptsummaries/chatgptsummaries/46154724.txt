Sorry, I cannot summarize the first court order without more specific information about the case and the allegations against Narendrasinh Bharatsinh Jadeja. However, the court granted him anticipatory bail in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under the Prohibition Act. The court considered the nature of allegations, gravity of offence, and role attributed to the accused, and also took into account the law laid down by the Supreme Court. The applicant was ordered to be released on bail on certain conditions, including cooperating with the investigation and not leaving India without permission. The court clarified that even if remanded to police custody, the applicant would be set free immediately upon completion of the period of police remand. The trial court was directed not to be influenced by the prima facie observations made by the high court in the present order.

As for the second court order, it cannot be summarized as the request for more information was not fulfilled.
