The Hussainsagar lake in Hyderabad has been a subject of concern for environmentalists and activists for years. The lake has been facing encroachment, pollution, and environmental degradation, which have led to a decline in its water quality and aquatic life. To address these issues, three writ petitions were filed in the court seeking directions to remove encroachments, ban immersion of Ganesh idols in the lake, and prevent the flow of contaminants and sewage water into the lake.

The court considered the factual matrix of the petitions, including reports from various committees, and noted that the immersion of idols in the lake had been a source of communal disharmony in the past. The court also reviewed the counter-affidavits filed by the respondents and their proposed measures to address the issues. After considering all the facts and arguments, the court issued an order to address the issues related to the protection of the Hussainsagar lake.

The court order discussed the pollution caused by the immersion of large idols in the Hussainsagar lake during the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. The court ordered the government to issue a notification that no idol should be prepared that is more than three feet in height to avoid the need for lorries to carry the idols in the procession. The court also noted a report by the Environmental Protection Training and Research Institute that highlighted the environmental and epidemiological impact of the immersion process. The court ordered the government to take steps to stop the pollution, including dividing the immersion of idols into several tanks to minimize pollution and widening the tank bund road. The court also noted the duty of the A.P. Pollution Control Board in this regard.

The court also ordered the respondents to follow guidelines similar to those issued by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board for the maintenance and cleanliness of water bodies after idol immersion. The respondents must also implement a plan for rehabilitation and extension of the drainage and sewerage system within a year. The Municipal Corporation and Sewerage Board must disconnect all illegal and unauthorized sewerage connections and desilt the drain regularly.

The writ petitions were limited to these matters, but parties can file separate applications for other matters. The court is open to further suggestions and may provide guidance if technical difficulties arise.

The court order is a significant step towards protecting the Hussainsagar lake from further degradation. The court has recognized the importance of the lake as a natural resource and has taken steps to ensure its protection. The order is a reminder to the government and the public that the protection of the environment is a collective responsibility. The court has also highlighted the need for sustainable development and the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection.

The court order is a positive development for the environmental movement in India. It is a reminder that the judiciary can play a crucial role in protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The order is also a reminder to the government and the public that environmental protection is not a luxury but a necessity for the survival of our planet.

In conclusion, the court order related to the protection of the Hussainsagar lake in Hyderabad is a significant step towards protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development. The order addresses the issues related to encroachment, pollution, and environmental degradation of the lake.
