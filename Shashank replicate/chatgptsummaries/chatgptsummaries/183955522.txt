The case in question appears to be a criminal case, and the petitioner, Mohammad Zafar, had filed a revision against an order passed by the 3rd Addl. Sessions Judge. The order in question had rejected an application filed under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. It appears that the petitioner had filed an application under this section, which was rejected by the 3rd Addl. Sessions Judge.

The court had earlier directed that the trial court may proceed with the case. This suggests that the case was still ongoing at the time of the revision filed by the petitioner. However, since the petitioner did not appear and seems to have lost interest in the petition, it has been dismissed for want of prosecution. This means that the petitioner did not pursue the case and did not appear in court when required to do so. As a result, the case has been dismissed.

It is not clear from the available information what the case was about or what charges were being brought against the petitioner. However, it appears that the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C., which was rejected by the 3rd Addl. Sessions Judge. The petitioner then filed a revision against this order, which was dismissed for want of prosecution.

The concerned court has been informed of the dismissal. It is not clear what the implications of this are, but it suggests that the case has been closed and that no further action will be taken. It is possible that the petitioner may have the option to file an appeal against the dismissal, but this is not clear from the available information.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Mohammad Zafar against an order passed by the 3rd Addl. Sessions Judge to the Court of 10th Addl.
