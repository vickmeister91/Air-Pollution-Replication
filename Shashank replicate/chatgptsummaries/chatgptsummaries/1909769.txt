The Madras High Court recently heard two civil revision petitions against an order passed in O.S.No.516/99 on the file of the Additional District Munsif, Namakkal. The defendant/petitioner in both C.R.Ps. claimed that the court below had no jurisdiction to hear the main suit, and that the court was not justified in keeping the injunction application without disposing of the same. The plaintiff/respondent filed a suit against the defendant/petitioner for permanent injunction, restraining him from carrying on the business of stone crushing by using the stone crushers in S.No.204/4A of Marurpatty village. The defendant/petitioner claimed that the relief prayed for flows from the Pollution Control Act, and that the Civil Court is not the proper forum. 

The court held that the plaintiff had to approach the Civil Court to vindicate his grievance relating to air pollution, and that the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is taken under Section 46 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court order states that Section 58 (similar to Section 46 of the Air Act) is intended to preserve the statutory protection given to the Boards untouched by civil actions. In the absence of any order by the Board or intervention by the Authority under the Act, any order passed by the Civil Court will not take away the jurisdictional aspect constituted under the Act. 

The court also holds that the suit instituted by the plaintiff is maintainable and directs the District Munsif to dispose of the injunction application on merits one way or other on or before 30-04-2003, after affording sufficient opportunity to both parties. This means that the plaintiff can approach the Civil Court to seek relief for air pollution caused by the defendant's stone crushing business. The court also clarifies that the Pollution Control Board has jurisdiction over such matters, and any order passed by the Civil Court will not take away the jurisdictional aspect constituted under the Act. 

This ruling is significant as it clarifies the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in matters related to air pollution and the role of the Pollution Control Board. It also highlights the importance of approaching the appropriate forum for seeking relief in such matters. The court's direction to dispose of the injunction application on merits also ensures that the matter is resolved in a timely manner. 

Overall, this court order provides clarity on the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in matters related to air pollution and emphasizes the importance of approaching the appropriate forum for seeking relief. It also ensures that the matter is resolved in a timely manner by directing the District Munsif to dispose of the injunction application on merits.
