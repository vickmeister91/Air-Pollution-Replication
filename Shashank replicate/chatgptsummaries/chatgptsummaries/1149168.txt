The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving the State of Himachal Pradesh and Ganesh Wood Products regarding the establishment of katha manufacturing units in the state. The court heard arguments about the availability of raw materials and the government's role in approving new industrial projects. The court ultimately upheld the government's decision to limit the number of katha manufacturing units in the state based on the availability of raw materials.

The dispute over the establishment of katha factories in Himachal Pradesh arose when the government approved only three units, but several others had applied for approval. The court heard arguments from various parties, including those who had applied for approval and those who opposed it. The court noted that the establishment of katha factories was not governed by the Industries Development and Regulation Act, and that the executive power of the state extended to the subject matter. The court ultimately upheld the government's decision to approve only three units and refused to approve the rest.

The court order discusses the power of the government to approve or disapprove the establishment of new industries, specifically in the case of katha units in Himachal Pradesh. The court states that the government has the right to lay down policies and preferences in the interest of the state and its economy, and that individuals seeking approval must abide by these policies. The court also references various enactments governing the establishment of forest-based industries and emphasizes the power of the Central Government to regulate the location of industries, including the power to prohibit their establishment. Overall, the court upholds the government's right to approve or disapprove new industries based on their policies and guidelines.

The court order also discusses the importance of forest conservation and the need for the government to exercise its powers to achieve the objectives of the Himachal Pradesh Forest Produce (Regulation of Trade) Act, 1982. The order also highlights the significance of sustainable development and inter-generational equity in the context of environmental protection. The court emphasizes the need to consider the impact of forest-based industries on the environment and ecology.

In one case, the court outlines the approval of a project to manufacture Acacia Catechu Extract and Bye Products (Cutch) with an annual capacity of 240 MT, subject to certain conditions. These conditions include taking effective steps within 12 months of approval, implementing anti-pollution measures, obtaining necessary permissions and clearances, and providing quarterly progress reports. The order also mentions concerns raised by the Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the availability of raw materials and sustainable forest management. The approval of other units was restricted, and the full committee of IPARA took note of concerns regarding the impact on forest wealth.

However, in another case, the court cancelled the approval of several katha factories due to concerns about the impact on the state's forest wealth. The IPARA restricted the number of factories and assessed the availability of khair wood, but there was no systematic survey of its availability. The state government approved only three out of 14 projects recommended by IPARA. The court criticized the myopic approach of the sub-committee of the IPARA.

The court order discusses the flawed approach of the sub-committee of IPARA in approving proposals for katha factories without considering the impact on forest wealth, environment, and sustainable growth. The court also examines the doctrine of promissory estoppel and its application in cases where the government makes a promise that the promisee relies on and alters their position. The court emphasizes that the doctrine should be flexible and used to achieve justice between the parties. The court also questions whether the doctrine of promissory estoppel should be given more weight than a written contract between parties.

In another case, the court discusses the doctrine of promissory estoppel and its application in a case where the government terminated a contract with five companies. The court states that the promisee may file a suit for specific performance of the contract, but the court will decide whether to grant specific performance or only a decree for damages for breach of contract. The court emphasizes that the equity implicit in the doctrine is to hold the scales even between the parties and do justice between them. The court orders a fresh disposal of the writ petitions in accordance with the law and in the light of the judgment. The government of Himachal Pradesh is also ordered to make a survey and assess the approximate availability of khair wood in the year 1996 and the ensuing years.

In conclusion, the court orders in these cases highlight the importance of sustainable development and environmental protection in the establishment of new industries. The court upholds the government's right to approve or disapprove new industries based on their policies and guidelines, and emphasizes the need to consider the impact of forest-based industries on the environment and ecology. The court also examines the doctrine of promissory estoppel and its application in cases where the government makes a promise that the promisee relies on and alters their position. The court emphasizes that the doctrine should be flexible and used to achieve justice between the parties.
