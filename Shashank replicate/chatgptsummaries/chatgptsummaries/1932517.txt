The court order pertains to the problems arising out of the running of a slaughterhouse located in Delhi. The slaughterhouse has been functioning for about 90 years and is being managed by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi. The population of Delhi has increased to about 85 lakhs or odd and thus at present about 8,000 sheep and goats and about 2,000 buffaloes on average are being slaughtered every day in the said slaughterhouse. The court has directed the Corporation to set up a new slaughterhouse on or before December 31, 1993, and to close down the existing slaughterhouse at the earliest. The court has also directed the authorities to take urgent steps to set up one slaughtering house at appropriate places.

The court has ordered the construction of a new slaughterhouse away from the city by December 31, 1993, and the closure of the current one by the same date. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi is not obligated to maintain the slaughterhouse for export purposes and will charge a fixed fee for slaughtering during specific hours for export. The Corporation must also increase the number of veterinary doctors and ensure proper examination of cattle before slaughter. Samples of meat must be lifted and analyzed frequently to ensure proper meat is supplied to consumers. Committees have been formed to suggest ways to improve hygienic and environmental conditions in the slaughterhouse and its vicinity and to ensure the new slaughterhouse is constructed before the deadline. The court may order the closure of the slaughterhouse earlier if no improvement is made.
