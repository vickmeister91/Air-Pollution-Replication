The court order discusses the issue of pollution in Ludhiana, a highly industrialized city in Punjab, caused by the Budha Nullah water stream, which passes through the city and ultimately merges with the river Sutlej. The court takes suo-motu notice of the issue and seeks a comprehensive plan to make Ludhiana and Budha Nullah pollution-free. The court hears arguments from various parties and advocates and ultimately delivers a judgment on November 14, 2011.

The court order addresses the issue of pollution caused by industrialization and lack of proper waste treatment in the town of Ludhiana. The court calls for corrective measures to be taken by the concerned authorities to prevent pollution of air, water, and soil. The order also mentions the establishment of sewage treatment plants and effluent treatment plants, as well as the need for a comprehensive plan to deal with waste and effluents. The government has proposed various strategies for cleaning up the Budha Nullah, including the diversion of water from the Sutlej, remodelling of the nullah, and the establishment of a bio-fence. The order also mentions the need to remove encroachments on the land of Budha Nullah and to create a green belt on its banks. The court calls for the implementation of these measures and for regular monitoring of progress.

The court order discusses the pollution caused by dairy waste and industrial effluents in Budha Nullah, a stream in Ludhiana, Punjab. The court notes that various committees and meetings have been held to address the issue, but necessary action has not been taken. The court cites a report by an expert committee that highlights the disastrous effects of pollution on human health and the environment. The report recommends measures for sewage disposal, disposal of industrial effluents, and restoration of Budha Nullah. The court also notes the importance of a master plan for the city to control the location of industries and hazardous activities. The P.Ram Committee suggests options for disposal of treated sewage and the installation of adequate sewage treatment plants. The committee recommends a separate treatment plant for industrial effluents and a CETP for treating waste from the electroplating industry.

The court ordered the establishment of a separate treatment plant for industrial effluents and a CETP for treating waste from electroplating industry in Ludhiana. The Municipal Corporation was directed to set up a treatment facility for animal waste generated by the slaughterhouse and to stop dumping of husk ash by some industries and other users in and around Budha Nullah. The court also called for the demarcation of the entire length of Budha Nullah and the removal of encroachments. The court banned new industry and expansion of existing industry until the notification of the Master Plan and imposed a ban on the discharge of treated or untreated sewage into Budha Nullah. The court also ordered the outsourcing of solid waste management and the planning, designing, and construction of storm water drainage systems. PPCB was directed to strengthen its scientific staff to monitor the industry in Ludhiana to ensure 100% compliance with the standards prescribed by the Board. All small electroplating industries were ordered to commence transporting their effluents to CETP in Focal Point VIII by 31.3.2007, failing which they should be closed with effect from 1.4.2007. Similarly, all textile dyeing units discharging into Budha Nullah must either re-circulate their effluents or stop discharging the effluents into Budha Nullah by 31.3.2007, failing which they should be ordered to be closed.

The court ordered regular meetings to monitor the implementation of recommendations made by the P.Ram Committee to solve the problem of pollution in Ludhiana. The Chief Secretary of Punjab filed an affidavit stating that a deadline was set to finalize the master plan of Ludhiana city and that work was being done to commission sewage treatment plants and acquire land for solid waste management. However, the court noted that no effective steps were taken to remove slums and encroachments along Budha Nullah and to treat effluents from industries. The court categorized the issues that required attention, including notification of the master plan, banning new industry/expansion, banning discharge of sewage into Budha Nullah, and acquiring land for biogas plants.

The court issued various directions to address environmental issues in Ludhiana, including desilting of the river and waste management. The court ordered the acquisition of land for hazardous waste management and directed textile and electroplating industries to achieve zero liquid discharge. The court also directed various departments to coordinate and file status reports on the implementation of recommendations made by the P.Ram Committee. The estimated cost of necessary sewage treatment plant augmentations was deemed too high for the Municipal Corporation Ludhiana to bear.

The court order discusses the issue of wastewater management in Ludhiana, where untreated sewage and industrial effluent is being discharged into Budha Nallah and Sutlej river. The court notes that the Municipal Corporation Ludhiana cannot bear the cost of constructing new treatment plants and pumping stations, and requests the government of Punjab to fund these projects. The court also discusses the findings of the Central Pollution Control Board and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, which highlight the need for upgrading existing treatment plants and ETPs, and for strict monitoring of effluent discharge. The court orders the state government
