The Orissa Forest Act, 1972, is a legislation enacted by the State of Orissa to regulate the felling of trees, the transit of forest produce, and the protection of forests. The Act provides for the constitution of Forest Settlement Officers, Forest Settlement Tribunals, and Forest Offences Courts to enforce its provisions. The Act also empowers the State Government to declare any land to be a protected forest, a reserved forest, or a village forest.

In a recent case, the Orissa High Court quashed an order taking cognizance of an offense under Section 37 of the Orissa Forest Act, 1972. The case pertained to a petitioner company that was granted a lease for a granite quarry by the State Government. During the lease period, the Forest Department seized around 12 truckloads of granite stones from the petitioner company for violating the provisions contained in Section 34 of the Orissa Forest Act.

The petitioner challenged the legality of the order taking cognizance of the offense under Section 37 of the Orissa Forest Act. The court found that there was no notification brought on record to show that the land where the alleged act was committed was a protected one. Additionally, there was a delay of more than six months in filing the prosecution report, and no plausible explanation was offered for the same.

The court observed that the provisions of the Orissa Forest Act, 1972, are meant to protect the forests and the environment. However, the Act cannot be used as a tool to harass innocent persons or to settle personal scores. The court further observed that the Forest Department must act in a fair and impartial manner and follow the due process of law while enforcing the provisions of the Act.

The court also noted that the Forest Department had not followed the procedure laid down in Section 52 of the Orissa Forest Act, 1972, which requires the Forest Officer to issue a notice to the person alleged to have committed an offense and to give him an opportunity to show cause why he should not be prosecuted. The court held that the failure to follow the procedure laid down in Section 52 of the Act rendered the order taking cognizance of the offense illegal and unsustainable.

The court relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, (1992) 1 SCC 335, where the Supreme Court had laid down the guidelines to be followed by the courts while dealing with cases of abuse of the process of law. The court observed that the present case was a classic example of abuse of the process of law, and the order taking cognizance of the offense was liable to be quashed.

In conclusion, the Orissa High Court has sent a strong message to the Forest Department that it cannot act arbitrarily or in a high-handed manner while enforcing the provisions of the Orissa Forest Act, 1972. The court has emphasized the need for the Forest Department to act in a fair and impartial manner and to follow the due process of law while enforcing the provisions of the Act. The court has also reiterated the importance of protecting the forests and the environment, but at the same time, ensuring that innocent persons are not harassed or victimized.
