The recent court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India challenging the National Green Tribunal's exercise of suo-moto jurisdiction under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court notes a judgment by the Supreme Court in Union of India and others v. Major General Shri Kant Sharma and another, which states that when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievances, a writ petition should not be entertained ignoring the statutory dispensation. The court is considering whether this judgment is confined to the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 or has a wider ambit encompassing matters arising from other tribunals like the National Green Tribunal.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the judgment in Major General Shri Kant Sharma's case and whether it applies to all tribunals or only the Armed Forces Tribunal. The court concludes that the judgment applies to all tribunals where an appeal is provided for directly to the Supreme Court. The court also notes that it cannot reconsider the views expressed by the Supreme Court and dismisses the writ petitions as not maintainable. The National Green Tribunal is asked not to proceed with suo-moto proceedings for two months to allow parties to approach the Supreme Court.
