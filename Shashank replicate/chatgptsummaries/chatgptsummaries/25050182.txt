The Wild Life Protection Act, 1971 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife in India. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The Act is enforced by the Forest Department and the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.

In this case, Deepak Kumar was accused of violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1971. The specific nature of the violation is not clear from the court order, but it is likely that he was accused of hunting or poaching a wild animal or bird. The court noted that no FIR had been registered against the petitioner and no complaint was pending before the court. This suggests that the Forest Department or the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau had not yet taken any action against the petitioner.

The court also noted that there was no need for custodial interrogation or recovery of anything from the petitioner. This means that the court did not believe that the petitioner posed a flight risk or that he was likely to tamper with evidence. The court also did not believe that there was any need to keep the petitioner in custody in order to recover any items related to the alleged violation of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1971.

Based on these factors, the court granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner. Anticipatory bail is a type of bail that is granted before a person is arrested. It is usually granted in cases where the court believes that the person is likely to be arrested, but where there is no need for custodial interrogation or recovery of anything from the person. Anticipatory bail is granted on the condition that the person will cooperate with the investigation and will appear before the court as and when required.

Overall, the court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Deepak Kumar in this case is based on the fact that there was no need for custodial interrogation or recovery of anything from the petitioner.
