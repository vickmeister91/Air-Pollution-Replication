The court recently issued an order in response to a petition filed by M/S Jaycee Landbase Pvt. Ltd. The petition sought the quashing of a complaint filed against the company under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The complaint alleged that the company had started construction of a commercial complex without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately allowed the petition, stating that the clearance certificate had been obtained by the petitioner later on and hence, the criminal proceedings against them were not justified.

The court order stated that the petitioner was granted an Environment Clearance Certificate by the Government of India and thus, could not be criminally prosecuted on vague allegations levelled in the complaint. The court allowed the petition and quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings arising from it. However, the court also gave a note of caution that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had obtained the necessary clearance certificate from the government, which meant that they were not in violation of any environmental laws. The court also noted that the allegations against the petitioner were vague and lacked substance, which further strengthened their decision to quash the complaint.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary environmental clearances before starting any construction activity. It also serves as a reminder that criminal proceedings should not be initiated without proper evidence and that the power to quash such proceedings should be used judiciously.

The court's cautionary note regarding the power to quash criminal proceedings is particularly noteworthy. It serves as a reminder that the judiciary has a responsibility to ensure that justice is served, but that this responsibility must be exercised with care and caution. The court's decision to quash the complaint in this case was based on the specific circumstances of the case, and it is important to remember that each case must be evaluated on its own merits.

Overall, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following environmental laws and obtaining the necessary clearances before starting any construction activity. It also highlights the need for caution when initiating criminal proceedings and the importance of ensuring that justice is served in a fair and impartial manner.
