The court order pertains to a case involving M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd. and Arvinder S. Brara against the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The court proposes to decide all cases of the petitioners-accused by virtue of a common judgment. The court cites the United Nations Organization's concern for environmental degradation and the Indian government's commitment to protecting the environment through various acts and rules. The complaint alleges that the Central Government has imposed a ban on certain activities, and the Ministry of Environment has delegated powers to the State Government to accord environmental clearance. The court will refer to relevant facts and material from the main petitions to decide the core controversy.

In another case, M/s Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Limited, along with other developers, violated the Aravali Notification by developing a township on Gairmumkin Mountain (Pahad) in the revenue estate of village Raisina, District Gurgaon. The Pollution Board filed a complaint against the accused for violating the provisions of the Act of 1986 and Aravali Notification. The accused filed petitions to quash the complaints, but the court refused to do so and allowed the trial to proceed. The Pollution Board refuted the accused's claims and reiterated the allegations made in the complaint.

The court order discusses a case involving allegations of environmental pollution and violation of laws related to protection and improvement of the environment. The accused parties have denied the allegations and sought the quashing of the complaints and summoning orders. The court cites the conditions under which criminal prosecution can be quashed and emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment. The court also discusses relevant laws and regulations related to environmental protection and pollution control. Ultimately, the court finds no merit in the petitions seeking quashing of the complaints and summoning orders.

The court order pertains to the prosecution of individuals and companies for violating environmental laws in the Gurgaon and Alwar districts of India. The prohibited activities include new industrial operations, mining without permission, cutting of trees, construction of dwelling units and infrastructure, and electrification without permission. The court found that the accused had violated the provisions of the Act of 1986 and the notification (Annexure P5) and were liable for punishment under section 15 of the Act of 1986. The court rejected the defense that the accused had already changed the nature of the disputed land prior to the commencement of the notification.

In another case, the developers have violated the provisions of the Aravali Notification by constructing and allotting 108 farmhouses out of a cluster of 630. The court also mentions that the direct allegations are assigned to the petitioners-accused in the complaint and that the documents brought on record by the petitioners-accused are not relevant to decide the instant controversy between the parties under the Act of 1986. The court concludes that all other arguments, relatable to the appreciation of evidence, would be the moot points to be decided during the course of trial by the trial Court, after receiving the respective evidence of the parties.

The court order discusses various legal arguments made by the accused in a criminal case. The court rejects the argument that subsequent buyers of property cannot be prosecuted for offenses committed by the developers, as all co-accused are liable for the same offense. The court also upholds the summoning order, stating that at the stage of summoning, the magistrate only needs to determine if there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused, and does not need to weigh the evidence as meticulously as during the trial.

In another case, the court states that only witnesses considered material by the complainant need to be examined to make a prima facie case for issuing a process. The non-examination of other witnesses will be considered at the trial, not at the stage of issuing a process. The court finds no illegality or procedural irregularity in the summoning order. The court concludes that the accused have committed the indicated offenses and quashing the criminal prosecutions at this initial stage would perpetuate injustice to the public. The court dismisses the petitions and directs the trial court to take all effective steps for expeditious disposal of all complaints in accordance with the law. The parties are directed to appear before the Special/Trial Court for further proceedings. The court provides a list of developers and subsequent vendees/transferrees involved in the case.

The remaining court orders listed in the text involve various petitioners and the Haryana State Pollution Control Board as the respondent. The details of the cases are not provided, except for the case numbers and names of the petitioners and respondents. 

In summary, the court orders discussed in the text pertain to cases involving violations of environmental laws and regulations, including the Aravali Notification and the Act of 1986. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and upholds the summoning orders against the accused. The court also rejects the petitions seeking quashing of the complaints and summoning orders, and directs the trial court to take all effective steps for expeditious disposal of all complaints in accordance with the law.
