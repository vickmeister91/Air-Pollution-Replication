In a recent court order, the Jharkhand High Court quashed criminal proceedings against Bishwanath Pan, who had been accused of extracting coal from a protected forest area. The petitioner had filed a case against the State of Jharkhand and another party seeking to quash the criminal proceedings initiated against him under various sections of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act.

The prosecution had alleged that the petitioner had extracted coal from a protected forest area, which is a violation of the Forest Conservation Act. However, the petitioner argued that the land in question had lost its characteristics of forest land after the expiry of 30 years from the date of the notification issued in 1964. The petitioner contended that the land had been used for non-forest purposes for more than 30 years and had been converted into a non-forest area.

The court examined the evidence presented by both parties and agreed with the petitioner's argument. The court observed that the land in question had been used for non-forest purposes for more than 30 years and had lost its characteristics of forest land. The court noted that the land had been used for agricultural purposes, and there was no evidence to suggest that it was being used for any forest-related activities.

The court also observed that the notification issued in 1964 had declared the land as a protected forest area. However, the court noted that the notification did not specify the exact boundaries of the forest area. The court observed that the petitioner had produced evidence to show that the land in question was not part of the protected forest area.

Based on these observations, the court quashed the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioner. The court held that the prosecution had failed to establish that the petitioner had committed any offence under the Indian Forest Act or the Forest Conservation Act.

This court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position regarding the use of land that was previously declared as a protected forest area. The court has held that if the land has been used for non-forest purposes for more than 30 years, it loses its characteristics of forest land. This means that the land can be used for non-forest purposes without violating the Forest Conservation Act.

The court order also highlights the importance of clearly defining the boundaries of protected forest areas. The court has observed that the notification declaring an area as a protected forest area should specify the exact boundaries of the area. This will help avoid confusion and prevent innocent people from being prosecuted for offences they did not commit.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to quash the criminal proceedings against Bishwanath Pan is a significant development in the legal landscape of forest conservation in India. The court has clarified the legal position regarding the use of land that was previously declared as a protected forest area and has emphasized the importance of clearly defining the boundaries of protected forest areas. This court order will have far-reaching implications for future cases involving forest conservation in India.
