Air India Ltd. had filed a petition against the Union of India and another party, challenging an order passed by the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) cum Civil Authority, Amritsar, which imposed a penalty on Air India for allegedly violating the provisions of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and Rules made thereunder. The appeal against the order was dismissed by the respondent no.1, citing a delay of eight days in filing the appeal. However, the petitioner had filed an application for condoning the delay of eight days, which was not considered by the respondent.

The case was heard by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The court held that the respondent had the power to condone the delay and erred in not considering the application. The impugned order was set aside, and the matter was remanded to the respondent to consider afresh on merits uninfluenced by the delay in preferring the appeal.

The court observed that the power to condone delay is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously. The court also noted that the delay in filing the appeal was only eight days and that the petitioner had provided a reasonable explanation for the delay. The court further observed that the respondent had not given any reasons for not considering the application for condonation of delay.

The court relied on several precedents to support its decision. In the case of State of Haryana v. Chandra Mani, the Supreme Court had held that the power to condone delay is discretionary and should be exercised on sound principles. The court had also held that the delay should not be condoned if it is caused by negligence or lack of bona fides on the part of the appellant.

In another case, the Supreme Court had held that the power to condone delay is not to be exercised in a routine manner, and the appellant must show sufficient cause for the delay. The court had also held that the delay should not be condoned if it causes prejudice to the other party.

In the present case, the court found that the petitioner had provided a reasonable explanation for the delay and that the delay had not caused any prejudice to the respondent. The court also observed that the respondent had not given any reasons for not considering the application for condonation of delay.

The court, therefore, set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the respondent to consider afresh on merits uninfluenced by the delay in preferring the appeal.

In conclusion, the High Court of Punjab and Haryana held that the respondent had the power to condone the delay in filing the appeal and erred in not considering the application for condonation of delay. The court set aside the impugned order and remanded the matter to the respondent to consider afresh on merits uninfluenced by the delay in preferring the appeal. The court also observed that the power to condone delay is discretionary and should be exercised judiciously. The court relied on several precedents to support its decision and held that the delay should not be condoned if it is caused by negligence or lack of bona fides on the part of the appellant.
