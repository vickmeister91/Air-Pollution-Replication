Two court orders have been summarized, both of which pertain to violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first case involves a man named Shahid who was convicted under section 55 of the Act for possessing and dealing with wild birds without a permit or license. A wildlife inspector received information that Shahid was dealing with live wild birds and conducted a raid with wildlife officials, recovering 100 Black Headed Munias, 34 Rose Ringed Parakeets, and 10 Alexandrine Parakeets from Shahid's possession. The recovered birds were protected under the Act and were released into their natural habitat. The defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove possession or recovery of the case property from Shahid, but the court found him guilty.

In the second case, the accused was found in possession of wild birds without a license or authority, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused is convicted for the offense under sections 9, 44, and 49 of the Act. The court rejected the accused's defense that he was watching over the birds for someone else and that someone else had left the birds with him. The court also stated that it is not necessary to record witness statements under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and the absence of public witnesses does not necessarily invalidate the proceedings.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trade in wild animals and plants without a permit or license. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In both cases, the accused were found to be in violation of the Act by possessing and dealing with wild birds without a permit or license. The recovered birds were protected under the Act and were released into their natural habitat. The court found the accused guilty in both cases and convicted them under relevant sections of the Act.

In the first case, the defense argued that the prosecution failed to prove possession or recovery of the case property from Shahid. However, the court found him guilty under section 55 of the Act, which deals with possession and dealing in wild animals without a permit or license. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, which included the recovery of 100 Black Headed Munias, 34 Rose Ringed Parakeets, and 10 Alexandrine Parakeets from Shahid's possession. The recovered birds were protected under the Act, and their possession without a permit or license was a clear violation of the law.

In the second case, the accused's defense was that he was watching over the birds for someone else and that someone else had left the birds with him. However, the court rejected this defense and convicted the accused under sections 9, 44, and 49 of the Act. Section 9 deals with hunting of wild animals, section 44 deals with possession of wild animals, and section 49 deals with trade or commerce in wild animals. The court found that the accused was in possession of wild birds without a license or authority, which was a clear violation of the Act.

The court also stated that it is not necessary to record witness statements under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and the absence of public witnesses does not necessarily invalidate the proceedings. This means that the court can rely on other forms of evidence, such as documents and physical evidence, to prove its case. In both cases, the prosecution was able to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused were convicted under relevant sections of the Act.

In conclusion, the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants in India. Violations of the Act, such as possession and trade in wild animals without a permit or license, can result in criminal charges and convictions. The court orders summarized above demonstrate the importance of enforcing this law and protecting India's wildlife.
