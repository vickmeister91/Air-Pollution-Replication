The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard a case filed by M/s Krishna Industries against the State of Haryana and others regarding the rejection of their application for change of land use of Plot No. 68/1 DLF-1 and the removal of illegal construction made on the site. The court reviewed the facts of the case, including the purchase of the site by the petitioner, the approval of revised building plans, and the granting of licenses and no-objection certificates for industrial use. However, the court ultimately upheld the decision to reject the application for change of land use and ordered the removal of the illegal construction.

Another court order pertains to the regularization of QRG Hospital and the petitioner's contention that similar powers have not been exercised in their case. The petitioner argues that the impugned orders lack application of mind and that the authorities have ignored Section 23 of the 1975 Act, which enables the government to exempt any building from the rigors of Section 3-B of the Act, 1975 in case where there is undue hardship or circumstances exist which render it expedient to do so. The petitioner also cites the case of QRG Hospital and argues that the authorities ought to have invoked their power under the 1994 Act by taking guidance from Section 23 of the 1975 Act for granting petitioner such exemption/conversion of the land use. The respondent argues that the order passed by the Director General Urban Local Bodies Haryana is perfectly valid as no change of land use can be permitted in respect of a Licensed Colony which is developed after approvals through the Town and Country Planning Department.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether the Municipal Corporation/Director General Urban Local Bodies Haryana has the power to grant change of land use in licensed colonies developed under the 1975 Act/approved under the 1963 Act and transferred to the Municipal Corporation. The court analyzes relevant statutory provisions and asks four questions for determination in the case. The court ultimately does not grant permission for change of land use in the present case.

The court order discusses the functions of the government in urban planning and building regulations, as outlined in Chapter XIV of the 1994 Act. This chapter provides provisions and procedures for the erection and re-erection of buildings, changing the use of existing buildings, and converting buildings for different purposes. Section 265 of the Act requires written permission from the Commissioner for any change in land use or building use, and allows the Commissioner to order the demolition, repair, or securing of buildings that pose a danger to occupants or passersby. The expenses incurred by the Commissioner in relation to any building under this section are recoverable from the owner or occupier as an arrear of tax under the Act.

The court order discusses provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act 1994, which provides for the administration of the municipal area and the powers and functions of the Corporation. The Act also deals with the declaration and publication of plans of controlled areas, which are areas within the Corporation that are subject to certain restrictions on land use. The court notes that the Act applies to all areas within the municipal limits, including controlled areas declared under the Punjab Scheduled Roads and Controlled Areas Restriction of Unregulated Development Act, 1963. The court also discusses provisions of the 1963 Act, which empowers the government to declare areas outside municipal towns as controlled areas for the purpose of regulating building activities.

The court order outlines the regulations and conditions for the use of land in controlled areas, including the prohibition of using land for purposes other than what it was originally intended for without permission from the Director and payment of conversion charges. Licenses are required for certain operations such as charcoal-kilns, pottery kilns, and quarrying. The Director has the power to grant or refuse permission for building and development in controlled areas, and a register must be maintained of all cases. The Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act of 1975 provides regulations for the development of colonies in controlled areas, including the requirement for approved plans and adherence to specified norms and conditions. The government has the power to exempt certain areas or persons from these regulations.

The court order discusses various provisions of the 1963, 1975, and 1994 Acts related to the development and regulation of urban areas in Haryana. It highlights the power of the Municipal Corporation to exercise jurisdiction over the administration of its area, including the control of land use and development. The order also mentions the authority of the Competent Authority to grant or refuse change of land use applications and the power of the government to exempt certain classes of persons or areas from the provisions of the Acts. The court emphasizes the need for the designated authority to consider all relevant factors before accepting or declining an application for change of land use.

The court order discusses the power and authority of the Municipal Corporation to grant change of land use in licensed colonies developed under the 1975 Act and approved under the 1963 Act. The court finds that the Municipal Corporation has the power to grant such changes and that the Commissioner Municipal Corporation is empowered to permit the change of land use and conversion of buildings. The court also discusses the constitutional provisions related to municipalities and their powers and responsibilities, including urban planning and regulation of land use and construction of buildings.

The court order establishes that the local authority, including the Municipal Corporation, has the power to develop land and impose restrictions on the use and development of any area under the 199
