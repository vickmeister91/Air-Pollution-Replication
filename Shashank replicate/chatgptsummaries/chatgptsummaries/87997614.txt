The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. The Act also provides for penalties for offences related to wildlife, including possession, hunting, and trade.

In this case, Jasoda was found in possession of meat of Wild Boar, which is a protected species under the Act. The allegations against her are serious, and if proven, she could face significant penalties. However, the court order does not express any opinion on the merits of the case, and instead focuses on the question of bail.

Bail is a legal concept that allows a person who has been arrested or detained to be released from custody pending trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court for trial and will not commit any further offences while on bail. Bail is not a right, but rather a privilege that is granted at the discretion of the court.

In this case, the court has granted bail to Jasoda, but has imposed certain conditions on her. These conditions are designed to ensure that she cooperates in the investigation/trial and does not flee the country. The court has also required Jasoda to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties each in the like amount. This is a significant amount of money, and is intended to ensure that Jasoda takes her obligations seriously.

Overall, the court order in this case is a reminder of the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the need to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for significant penalties for offences related to wildlife, and it is important that these penalties are enforced. At the same time, the court order also highlights the importance of bail as a legal concept, and the need to balance the interests of justice with the rights of the accused. In this case, the court has granted bail to Jasoda, but has imposed significant conditions to ensure that she cooperates in the investigation/trial and does not flee the country.
