The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner was aggrieved by the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Deosar, District Singrauli in criminal revision no.500032/16. The order confirmed the decision made by the learned J.M.F.C., Deosar, District Singrauli in Forest Crime POR No.2476/19. The decision rejected the application filed under Section 457 of the Cr.P.C. for releasing the seized vehicle on Supurdgi.

The petitioner had requested the release of their seized vehicle on Supurdgi during the trial from the trial court. However, the court found that the petitioner had no right to make such a request. As a result, the petition was dismissed.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had used this section to challenge the decision made by the lower courts.

The decision made by the lower courts was based on the fact that the petitioner had no right to request the release of their seized vehicle on Supurdgi during the trial. Supurdgi is a legal term that refers to the temporary custody of property by a court. The court found that the petitioner had no legal right to make such a request and therefore rejected their application.

The court's decision was based on the provisions of the Cr.P.C. Section 457 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the release of property seized under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. Section 451 allows the police to seize any property that they believe may be used as evidence in a case. Section 457 allows for the release of such property on Supurdgi, but only under certain conditions.

The court found that the petitioner did not meet the conditions required for the release of their seized vehicle on Supurdgi. As a result, the court rejected their application.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the provisions of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner had no legal right to request the release of their seized vehicle on Supurdgi during the trial. As a result, their application was rejected. The court's decision was made in accordance with the law and was aimed at securing the ends of justice.
