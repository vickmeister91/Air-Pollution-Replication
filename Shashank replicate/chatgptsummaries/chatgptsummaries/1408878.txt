The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by residents of Gamalapadu and Sankarapuram/Kotayyanagaram villages in Andhra Pradesh against the grant of mining lease to Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. for setting up a cement plant. The petitioners argued that the project would adversely affect the environment, ecology, and irrigation system in the area. The respondents, including the Pollution Control Board, denied the allegations and stated that all necessary permissions had been granted after due examination of the project area and environmental aspects.

The court noted that while economic development is necessary, it must be done with requisite attention and care to prevent ecological imbalance and environmental degradation. The court order states that it is the responsibility of the government to decide whether to exploit deposits at the cost of ecology and environmental considerations or to satisfy industrial requirements in a sustainable manner. Natural resources are permanent assets and sustainable development is a balancing concept between ecology and development. The state has a responsibility to protect the environment for future generations while also doing economic justice to the people.

The court found that the necessary procedures were followed before granting permission for the establishment of a cement factory and mining operations. The factory is expected to be pollution-free and will be subject to conditions that must be complied with. The petitioners did not provide adequate factual data to show that the proposed plant was situated in a delicately balanced micro-environmental situation or is threatened with environmental disaster. The court concluded that the government and statutory authorities have enacted various environmental laws for protection of the environment and ecology, and permissions are always subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the statutory authorities empowered under the enactments.
