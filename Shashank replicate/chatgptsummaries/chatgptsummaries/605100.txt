In the first court case, the dispute was over whether certain lands were communal lands or not. The defendants argued that the lands were no longer communal due to various orders passed by authorities, but the court found that the orders were either invalid or ineffective. The court also clarified the provisions of the Estates Land Act and the Estates Abolition Act regarding communal lands and the jurisdiction of civil courts. Ultimately, the court upheld the decision of the lower courts that the lands in question were communal lands.

The second court order discussed the definition of certain types of land and the legal requirements for converting communal land into ryotwari land or landholder's ryoti land. The order concluded that the appellants had failed to establish their right to the suit lands, and that the orders they relied on were incomplete or erroneous. The court also noted that the Assistant Settlement Officer did not have the authority to convert communal land into ryoti land under the Estates Abolition Act. Overall, the court order denied the appellants' claim to the suit lands.

In the third court order, it was stated that a ryotwari patta cannot be granted to anyone who has leased lanka land or has a right to collect rent before the notified date. The lands in question were not lanka lands or declared as ryoti lands, and the Assistant Settlement Officer had no authority to grant a ryotwari patta without notice to interested parties. The order made by the Settlement Officer was invalid, and civil courts had jurisdiction to decide the dispute. The communal rights in the suit lands were not abolished under the Estates Abolition Act, and the rights of the community over the lands were not created by the principal or any other landholder. The appeal was dismissed with costs.

Overall, these court orders dealt with disputes over land ownership and the legal requirements for converting communal land into other types of land. The courts clarified the provisions of the Estates Land Act and the Estates Abolition Act and upheld the decisions of the lower courts in each case. The orders also emphasized the importance of following proper legal procedures and notifying all interested parties before making any changes to land ownership or use.
