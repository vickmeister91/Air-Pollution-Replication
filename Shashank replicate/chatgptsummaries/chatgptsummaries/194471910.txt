The recent court order pertains to a case filed by M/S Great Prabath Circus against the Union of India, seeking to quash a communication issued by the Central Zoo Authority and a subsequent endorsement by the State of Karnataka. The petitioner, a mobile circus, had sought a transit permit to move its four elephants from place to place, but the respondents claimed that the petitioner had not complied with the mandatory requirements of Section 38H of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The court examined the provisions of the Act and the amendments made to it, and concluded that the requirement for registration as contemplated under Section 38H(1A) would apply only to circuses established after the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002. As the petitioner's circus had been established much prior to the amendment, the requirement of filing an application for recognition did not apply to it. The court quashed the impugned communication and directed the fourth respondent to consider the petitioner's application for a transit permit.

The court order further states that the endorsement dated 29-6-2013 cannot be sustained and is quashed. The 4th respondent is directed to consider the petitioner's request to shift the elephants to Kengeri, and the applications made by the petitioner during the shifting of the circus from one place to another shall be considered by the 4th respondent in the same manner as before. The petition is disposed of accordingly.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 and its amendments. The court's interpretation of the Act and its application to the petitioner's circus, which was established prior to the amendment, is a significant development in the legal landscape of wildlife protection in India.

The court's decision to quash the communication issued by the Central Zoo Authority and the subsequent endorsement by the State of Karnataka is a clear indication that the authorities must follow the provisions of the Act and its amendments while dealing with cases related to wildlife protection. The court's direction to the fourth respondent to consider the petitioner's application for a transit permit is a positive step towards ensuring that the petitioner's rights are protected.

The court's order also highlights the need for circuses and other establishments that use animals for entertainment purposes to comply with the provisions of the Act and its amendments. The Act provides for the protection of wildlife and their habitats, and it is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure that these provisions are followed.

In conclusion, the court's order in the case filed by M/S Great Prabath Circus against the Union of India is a significant development in the legal landscape of wildlife protection in India. The court's interpretation of the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 and its amendments is a positive step towards ensuring that the Act is followed in letter and spirit. The court's direction to the fourth respondent to consider the petitioner's application for a transit permit is a welcome move towards protecting the petitioner's rights. The case serves as a reminder to all stakeholders to comply with the provisions of the Act and its amendments while dealing with cases related to wildlife protection.
