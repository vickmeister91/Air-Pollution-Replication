The issue of noise pollution has been a growing concern in India, with the indiscriminate use of loudspeakers and public address systems in residential areas and public places causing a disturbance to people's health and well-being. In response to this, several court orders have been issued to regulate noise-producing and generating sources and enforce the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000.

One such court order pertains to a writ petition filed by two petitioners who are aggrieved by the indiscriminate use of loudspeakers in a residential area regardless of time. The court directed the state functionaries to file a counter affidavit and mention the action taken against the offenders of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 and various directions issued by the Supreme Court from time to time, in the last five years. The court also noted that the State Government and its functionaries have miserably failed to perform their duties cast upon them under the Rules, 2000 and enforce the direction of the Supreme Court issued from time to time. The court expressed concern over the effect of noise pollution on people's health and the administration's lack of seriousness in taking action against those who breach the law and directions of the Supreme Court.

The court order directs the State Government to enforce the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000, which regulate noise-producing and generating sources. The order also highlights the need for the government to declare silence zones in accordance with the rules and take steps to ensure compliance. The court emphasizes the importance of upholding the rule of law and cites previous judgments on the issue of noise pollution. The order also references a recent case in which the court issued directions to control noise pollution in the state and enforce the rules and directions of the Supreme Court.

In another court order, officials have been directed to take action against the use of loudspeakers and public address systems in public places without written permission. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the measures taken by authorities to control noise pollution and directed them to be personally present. The state government proposed measures such as purchasing a machine to measure noise levels and issuing notices to religious places for permission to use loudspeakers. The court has referred to previous judgments on noise pollution and its effects on human health. The court has issued several directions for strict compliance to control noise pollution.

The Bombay High Court has also issued several directions for strict compliance of its directions on noise pollution in a PIL case. The court has incorporated some directions issued by the Supreme Court in NOISE POLLUTION (V), IN RE (supra) and has issued additional directions for strict compliance. The court has directed the District Magistrate to give adequate publicity in leading newspapers regarding the directions and Rules, 2000, and to notify the name of the authority under the Rules, 2000 and his contact number. The court has also directed the authorities to provide a toll-free number to citizens to make complaints about noise pollution and has prohibited the use of DJ systems. The court has charged the competent authority under the Rules, 2000 and the SHO/Inspector of concerned Police Station with the duty of ensuring compliance of the order of the Supreme Court and the Rules, 2000, failing which they shall be answerable to the court in contempt jurisdiction.

Finally, the court has ordered the authorities in Lucknow to take necessary actions and report back to the Registrar General of the Court. A writ petition has been allowed in this regard. The order was issued on August 20, 2019.

In conclusion, the issue of noise pollution has been a growing concern in India, and several court orders have been issued to regulate noise-producing and generating sources and enforce the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. The courts have emphasized the importance of upholding the rule of law and cited previous judgments on the issue of noise pollution and its effects on human health. The authorities have been directed to take necessary actions and ensure strict compliance with the rules and directions of the Supreme Court to control noise pollution.
