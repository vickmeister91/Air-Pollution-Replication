The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Kanta Rani against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

In this court order, the Tribunal directs the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and orders the State to issue show cause notices to those contributing to pollution and to collect compensation for causing pollution. The State is also directed to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal, which are causing contamination of canal water. The compliance report filed by the State is found to be inadequate, and the Chief Engineer of Water Resources is directed to file a detailed affidavit. The order also notes that a Public Interest Litigation is pending before the Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan at Jodhpur in Civil Writ Petition (PIL) No. 12876/2011 (Ved Prakash Joshi Vs. State of Raj. & Ors.).

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water, analyze them, and report the findings. The report reveals that the water in the clean water reservoir is normal, but the court wants to know the standard of water running through the distributories. The state is directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The court also orders the District Collector to be present with relevant records on the next posting date.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The court gives the Counsel for the State another opportunity to file a response to the compliance report and orders the District Collector to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and notes that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting other statutory remedies.

The court order states that the applicant is barred by limitation and the issue has not been decided yet. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. The case is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which has the power to condone the delay. The remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India. The writ petition is dismissed, and the petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
