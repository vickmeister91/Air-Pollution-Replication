The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order in response to two writ petitions filed by transport contractors regarding the applicability of Euro II and Euro III norms to vehicles used for the transportation of LPG cylinders in Delhi. The petitioners argued that vehicles manufactured after 1.4.2005 should conform to Bharat Stage III norms, while those with national permits should conform to Bharat Stage II norms. 

The court held that commercial vehicles within 15 years of their registration can ply on Delhi roads without conforming to Bharat Stage II norms, but those registered after 1.4.2005 must conform to Bharat Stage III norms. The court dismissed the writ petitions, stating that the tender conditions were not violative of the norms and notifications issued under the Central Motor Vehicles Rules or the directions of the Supreme Court.

The court order has significant implications for transport contractors in Delhi who use commercial vehicles for the transportation of LPG cylinders. The order clarifies the norms that these vehicles must conform to, based on their date of registration. Vehicles registered after 1.4.2005 must conform to Bharat Stage III norms, while those registered before that date can continue to ply on Delhi roads without conforming to Bharat Stage II norms.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the relevant laws and regulations governing the use of commercial vehicles in Delhi. The court noted that the Central Motor Vehicles Rules require all vehicles to comply with the emission norms specified by the government. The court also considered the directions of the Supreme Court in this regard, which have emphasized the need to reduce air pollution in Delhi and other cities.

The court's decision is likely to have a positive impact on air quality in Delhi, as it will ensure that commercial vehicles used for the transportation of LPG cylinders comply with the latest emission norms. This will help to reduce the amount of harmful pollutants released into the air, which can have serious health consequences for residents of the city.

Overall, the court order represents an important step forward in the effort to reduce air pollution in Delhi and other cities in India. By clarifying the emission norms that commercial vehicles must comply with, the court has provided a clear framework for transport contractors and other stakeholders to follow. This will help to ensure that the transportation of LPG cylinders is carried out in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, while also supporting the broader goal of reducing air pollution in India.
