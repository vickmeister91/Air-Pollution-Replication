The court order pertains to a dispute between the Kottayam Nature Society and the Union of India over the leasing of a 48.2-acre piece of land on Pathiramanal Island to the Oberoi Hotels for 30 years. The island is ecologically fragile and is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including migratory birds. The petitioners allege that the construction of any kind on the island would destroy its beauty and violate the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963. The respondents argue that the project is designed to protect the environment and that the government is conscious of its duty to preserve the island's natural beauty. The court must determine whether the government's decision to lease the land violates the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act and whether the project will result in the destruction or development of the island.

The court order discusses whether the government's action of developing a tourist resort on excess land violates the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963 and whether it would result in the destruction or development of the island. The court finds that the government did not violate the act as the land can be reserved for a public purpose, but only for agrarian reform. The court also finds that there is no evidence of a bird sanctuary or wildlife sanctuary on the island, and that the government has taken into account relevant facts and made a proper assessment before deciding to develop the tourist resort. The court ultimately allows the development to proceed.

The court order discusses a dispute over the development of an island in Kerala, India. The petitioner argued that the area falls within the Coastal Regulation Zone-I and that no construction can be raised on the land. However, the court found that the island does not fall within the Coastal Regulation Zone 1 and the restrictions as contemplated under the notification are not attracted. The court also dismissed the petitioner's claim that the construction of a hotel would affect the ecology and the environment, stating that the appropriate authority, including the Ministry of Environment, shall consider the relevant facts when the project actually takes off. The court also found that the government was not bound to invite tenders for the project. The petitions were dismissed, and no order was made as to costs.
