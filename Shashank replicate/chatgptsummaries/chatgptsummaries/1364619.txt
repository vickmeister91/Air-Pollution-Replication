The Madras High Court recently passed a court order pertaining to three revision petitions filed by Sekar against orders passed in various criminal cases related to the seizure of his lorry by the Bank of Madura due to his default in loan repayment. Sekar had filed petitions under Sections 91 and 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking custody and production of the lorry, which were dismissed by the trial magistrate. The court upheld the dismissal, stating that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar and that the dismissal of the private complaint filed by Sekar against the bank for alleged theft was proper.

The first revision petition filed by Sekar was against the order passed by the trial magistrate dismissing his petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking custody of the lorry. The court observed that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar. The court also noted that the bank had filed a complaint against Sekar for default in loan repayment and that the lorry was seized pursuant to the complaint. The court held that the trial magistrate had rightly dismissed Sekar's petition under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The second revision petition filed by Sekar was against the order passed by the trial magistrate dismissing his petition under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking production of the lorry. The court observed that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar. The court also noted that the bank had filed a complaint against Sekar for default in loan repayment and that the lorry was seized pursuant to the complaint. The court held that the trial magistrate had rightly dismissed Sekar's petition under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The third revision petition filed by Sekar was against the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissing his private complaint against the bank for alleged theft. The court observed that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar. The court also noted that the bank had filed a complaint against Sekar for default in loan repayment and that the lorry was seized pursuant to the complaint. The court held that the dismissal of Sekar's private complaint against the bank for alleged theft was proper.

One of the revision petitions filed by the bank was allowed, and the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate was set aside. The bank had filed a revision petition against the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate directing it to release the lorry to Sekar. The court observed that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar. The court also noted that the bank had filed a complaint against Sekar for default in loan repayment and that the lorry was seized pursuant to the complaint. The court held that the Chief Judicial Magistrate had erred in directing the bank to release the lorry to Sekar and set aside the order.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court upheld the dismissal of Sekar's petitions seeking custody and production of the lorry and the dismissal of his private complaint against the bank for alleged theft. The court held that the bank had the right to seize the lorry as per the deed of hypothecation signed by Sekar. The court also set aside the order passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate directing the bank to release the lorry to Sekar.
