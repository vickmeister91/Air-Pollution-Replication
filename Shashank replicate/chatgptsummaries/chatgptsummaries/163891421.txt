The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by HK Kalchuri and Education Trust against the State of Madhya Pradesh. The petitioners had challenged an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) without notice and in violation of the principle of natural justice. The government advocate raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution, stating that a right to appeal under Section 22 is available against the order passed by the NGT. However, the court directed for issuance of notice to all concerned and stayed further proceedings and coercive steps in consequence to the impugned orders passed by the NGT.

The writ petition filed by HK Kalchuri and Education Trust challenged an order passed by the NGT without notice and in violation of the principle of natural justice. The petitioners argued that the order was passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard and without following the due process of law. The government advocate, on the other hand, raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution, stating that a right to appeal under Section 22 is available against the order passed by the NGT.

The court considered both arguments and directed for issuance of notice to all concerned. The court also stayed further proceedings and coercive steps in consequence to the impugned orders passed by the NGT. The court's decision to issue notice and stay further proceedings was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties be given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made.

The court's decision to issue notice and stay further proceedings is significant because it ensures that the petitioners have a fair chance to present their case before the court. The court's decision also upholds the principle of natural justice, which is a fundamental principle of law that requires that all parties be given an opportunity to be heard before any decision is made.

The court's decision to issue notice and stay further proceedings is also important because it ensures that the NGT's order is not implemented until the court has had a chance to review it. This is important because it prevents any irreparable harm from being caused to the petitioners or any other parties affected by the NGT's order.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's recent court order in response to a writ petition filed by HK Kalchuri and Education Trust against the State of Madhya Pradesh is significant because it upholds the principle of natural justice and ensures that all parties have a fair chance to present their case before the court. The court's decision to issue notice and stay further proceedings is also important because it prevents any irreparable harm from being caused to the petitioners or any other parties affected by the NGT's order.
