Dr. C.D. Dyavaiah, a resident of Bangalore, filed a criminal petition to quash the registration of a case against him for violating provisions under the Wild Life Protection Act. The case was registered by the forest department after they issued a show cause notice to Dr. Dyavaiah to explain his possession of ivory pieces and appear for an inquiry. However, before the deadline, the forest department registered a criminal case against him, which Dr. Dyavaiah found to be unfair.

The case was heard in court, and the judge found that the forest department's actions were unjustified. The court ordered the proceedings to be quashed, and Dr. Dyavaiah was given one week to submit his reply to the notice. The forest department was instructed to hold an inquiry and consider the explanation before registering a case against him.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. The possession of ivory is also prohibited under the act, as it is obtained from the tusks of elephants, which are protected animals.

Dr. Dyavaiah's case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that individuals are given a fair chance to explain their actions before being charged with a criminal offense. The forest department's decision to register a case against Dr. Dyavaiah before the deadline for his reply to the show cause notice was unfair and violated his rights.

The court's decision to quash the proceedings against Dr. Dyavaiah was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that individuals be given a fair hearing before any action is taken against them. The court found that the forest department had not followed due process and had acted unfairly in registering a case against Dr. Dyavaiah.

The court's order also highlights the importance of conducting a thorough inquiry before registering a case against an individual. The forest department was instructed to hold an inquiry and consider Dr. Dyavaiah's explanation before taking any further action against him. This ensures that individuals are given a fair chance to explain their actions and that the authorities have all the necessary information before taking any action.

In conclusion, Dr. Dyavaiah's case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that individuals are given a fair chance to explain their actions before being charged with a criminal offense. The court's decision to quash the proceedings against Dr. Dyavaiah was based on the principle of natural justice, and the forest department was instructed to hold an inquiry and consider his explanation before taking any further action against him. This ensures that individuals are given a fair chance to explain their actions, and the authorities have all the necessary information before taking any action.
