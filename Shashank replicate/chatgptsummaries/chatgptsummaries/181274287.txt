In a recent court order, applicant No. 2, a woman accused of an offense under the Prohibition Act, registered with Vapi Town Police Station, Valsad, has been granted regular bail. The court has ordered her release on regular bail on the condition of executing a personal bond of Rs. 10,000/- with one surety of the same amount. Additionally, the applicant is required to follow certain conditions, including surrendering her passport, marking her presence before the concerned Police Station on alternate Mondays for three months, and not leaving the State of Gujarat without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned.

The court has also allowed the authorities to release the applicant only if she is not required in connection with any other offense for the time being. This order comes as a relief to the applicant, who has been in custody for some time now.

The court's decision to grant regular bail to the applicant is based on several factors. Firstly, the court has taken into account the nature of the offense that the applicant has been accused of. The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain areas. While the offense is serious, it is not one that is considered to be heinous or grave.

Secondly, the court has considered the applicant's personal circumstances. The applicant is a woman, and the court has taken into account the fact that women are often subjected to various forms of harassment and abuse in custody. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has no prior criminal record and is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

Thirdly, the court has considered the fact that the applicant has cooperated with the investigation and has not hindered the progress of the case in any way. The court has also taken into account the fact that the applicant has a fixed place of residence and is not likely to flee.

In light of these factors, the court has granted regular bail to the applicant. However, the court has also imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that she does not abscond or tamper with evidence. The condition of executing a personal bond of Rs. 10,000/- with one surety of the same amount is a standard condition that is imposed on all applicants who are granted bail.

The condition of surrendering her passport is also a standard condition that is imposed on applicants who are granted bail. This condition is imposed to ensure that the applicant does not leave the country while the case is pending. The condition of marking her presence before the concerned Police Station on alternate Mondays for three months is also a standard condition that is imposed on applicants who are granted bail. This condition is imposed to ensure that the applicant does not abscond and is available for the investigation.

The condition of not leaving the State of Gujarat without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned is a specific condition that has been imposed on the applicant in this case. This condition has been imposed to ensure that the applicant does not leave the state without the permission of the court. This condition is necessary because the offense that the applicant has been accused of is a state-specific offense.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant regular bail to the applicant is a welcome relief for the applicant. The court has taken into account several factors while making this decision, including the nature of the offense, the applicant's personal circumstances, and the progress of the investigation. The conditions that have been imposed on the applicant are standard conditions that are imposed on all applicants who are granted bail. These conditions are necessary to ensure that the applicant does not abscond or tamper with evidence. Overall, the court's decision is a fair and just one that takes into account the interests of both the applicant and the state.
