The Salim Ali Nature Interpretation Center at Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, India, was the subject of a court order sought by petitioners who claimed that the center was illegally constructed and had no connection to the conservation, preservation, and protection of the park. The park is a world-famous bird sanctuary and home to a diverse range of flora and fauna. The WWF India developed a plan to establish an interpretation center at the park, which was approved by the State Government. The construction of the center was funded by the Daniel Swarovski Corporation, Austria, and was stopped and restarted due to objections from the Ghana Keoladeo National History Society.

The court ultimately found that the construction of the interpretation center was for the purpose of educating visitors and creating awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation, and therefore did not violate the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court order states that the construction of an interpretation center in a national park for educating visitors about the importance of wildlife does not require permission from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court emphasizes the importance of educating people about the conservation and preservation of wildlife and forests for the sustenance of human life.

The court also notes that the construction of an interpretation center falls under the purview of the Chief Wild Life Warden, who is authorized to control, manage, and maintain sanctuaries. The court also mentions that the National Wildlife Action Plan, 1982, emphasizes the establishment of interpretation programs in national parks. The court examines an agreement between WWF-India and D. Swarovoski Company for funding the construction of the interpretation center.

The court order discusses a project to develop Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan, India, which includes the construction of a visitor center, nature trails, and signage throughout the park. The agreement between the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Forest Department of the Government of Rajasthan stipulates that the physical structures and equipment purchased for the project will become the property of the Forest Department. The court rejects the petitioner's claim that the land has been leased to D. Swarovski & Co. for the construction of an interpretation center. The court also rules that commercial activity will not be permitted in the park.

The court finds no fault with the construction of the new Interpretation Center by the WWF at the site in question and dismisses the writ petition. The court's decision highlights the importance of educating people about the conservation and preservation of wildlife and forests, and the role of interpretation centers in achieving this goal. The court also emphasizes the need for proper management and control of national parks and sanctuaries to ensure their protection and preservation for future generations. The court's ruling sets a precedent for the construction of interpretation centers in national parks and emphasizes the importance of such centers in promoting awareness and education about wildlife conservation.
