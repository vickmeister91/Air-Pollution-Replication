The court recently heard a writ application filed by Binod Sinha, who sought to quash a notice issued by the Special Judge (Vigilance), Ranchi, directing him to deposit his passport within a week in connection with a vigilance case. The petitioner argued that the order was illegal and without jurisdiction, and if carried out, would infringe his fundamental right to liberty. The court found that the order did have the effect of impounding the passport, which only the Passport Authority has the power to do. However, the court allowed the investigating agency to retain the passport for a limited period if necessary for verification purposes, but not for more than a week. Any longer retention would be considered impounding.

The court's decision was based on the fact that impounding a passport is a serious matter that can have significant consequences for an individual's fundamental rights. The court recognized that the right to travel abroad is an important aspect of personal liberty, and that any restriction on this right must be based on valid grounds and must be proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved.

In this case, the court found that the notice issued by the Special Judge (Vigilance) was not in accordance with the law, as it had the effect of impounding the passport. The court noted that only the Passport Authority has the power to impound a passport, and that this power must be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Passport Act, 1967. The court also observed that the investigating agency had not provided any valid grounds for retaining the passport for a period of three months, as this would be considered impounding.

The court, therefore, directed the petitioner to produce his passport within a week, and ordered that it must be returned to him after verification by the investigating officer. The court also made it clear that the investigating agency could retain the passport for a limited period if necessary for verification purposes, but not for more than a week. Any longer retention would be considered impounding, and would be in violation of the petitioner's fundamental right to liberty.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of personal liberty and the right to travel abroad. It also underscores the need for investigating agencies to exercise their powers in accordance with the law, and to ensure that any restrictions on an individual's fundamental rights are based on valid grounds and are proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the protection of individual rights and liberties. It serves as a reminder to investigating agencies that they must act within the bounds of the law, and that any restrictions on an individual's fundamental rights must be based on valid grounds and must be proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved. The court's decision also underscores the importance of the judiciary in upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of citizens.
