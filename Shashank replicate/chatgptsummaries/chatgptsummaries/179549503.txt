The court order in question pertains to an anticipatory bail application filed by Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane in connection with a criminal case registered against him for illegal excavation of sand from the river bed of Savitri river. The FIR was lodged based on the opinion of the panchas that the applicant was committing the offence, but there was no concrete evidence to support this opinion. The court granted anticipatory bail to the applicant, directing him to furnish a PR bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two sureties in the like amount.

The case against Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane was registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by the Taluka Mining Officer, who alleged that the applicant was illegally excavating sand from the river bed of Savitri river. The complaint was supported by the opinion of the panchas, who had witnessed the alleged offence.

However, during the hearing of the anticipatory bail application, the court noted that there was no concrete evidence to support the opinion of the panchas. The court observed that the opinion of the panchas was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the applicant beyond reasonable doubt. The court also noted that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and was a resident of the area for the past 30 years.

Taking into account these factors, the court granted anticipatory bail to the applicant. The court directed the applicant to furnish a PR bond of Rs. 25,000 with one or two sureties in the like amount. The court also directed the applicant to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with the evidence.

The grant of anticipatory bail to Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane is significant as it highlights the importance of concrete evidence in establishing guilt in criminal cases. The court's observation that the opinion of the panchas was not sufficient to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt underscores the need for a strong evidentiary basis in criminal cases.

The court's decision also reflects the importance of individual circumstances in determining the grant of bail. The court took into account the fact that the applicant had no criminal antecedents and was a resident of the area for the past 30 years. This suggests that the court was mindful of the potential impact of pre-trial detention on the applicant's life and livelihood.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the importance of a fair and evidence-based criminal justice system. The grant of anticipatory bail to Shaukat Abdul Wahab Issane highlights the need for concrete evidence to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and the importance of individual circumstances in determining the grant of bail.
