The court order pertains to a mining lease granted for Laterite in a reserved forest area. The appellant sought permission to cut down trees in the area for mining operations, but the Forest Department refused to grant permission without prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The appellant argued that since the lease was granted prior to the Act coming into force, prior approval was not necessary. However, the court held that permission from the Forest Department was necessary before cutting down any forest growth in a reserved forest area, and that the grant of a mining lease did not automatically grant permission to cut down trees. The court also held that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, applied to all forest areas, regardless of when the lease was granted.

The court order states that the grant of a mining lease does not automatically grant permission to cut and clear forest growth in a reserved forest. The lessee must still abide by the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and obtain prior approval from the Central Government before cutting and removing any forest growth. The court cites a previous case where it was determined that mining operations can only be carried out in areas where forest land has already been broken up or cleared before the Act came into force, and any further clearing or breaking up of forest land requires prior approval from the Central Government. The court also clarifies that the grant of a mining lease does not equate to permission to break up or clear forest land, and that the date on which the State Government or other authority permits such actions is what is relevant for the purposes of the Act. The writ appeal is dismissed.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the grant of mining leases in reserved forest areas. The court has held that the grant of a mining lease does not automatically grant permission to cut down trees or clear forest growth in the area. The lessee must still obtain prior approval from the Central Government under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, before carrying out any such activities. This is in line with the provisions of the Act, which seeks to protect forest areas and regulate the use of forest land.

The court has also clarified that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, applies to all forest areas, regardless of when the lease was granted. This means that even if the lease was granted prior to the Act coming into force, the lessee must still obtain prior approval from the Central Government before carrying out any activities that involve cutting down trees or clearing forest growth. This is an important clarification as it ensures that the provisions of the Act are applied uniformly across all forest areas.

The court has also cited a previous case where it was held that mining operations can only be carried out in areas where forest land has already been broken up or cleared before the Act came into force.
