The court orders mentioned in the given summaries pertain to eviction petitions filed by landlords against their tenants. In the first case, Sardar Karam Singh filed an eviction petition against his tenants, Sh. Varinder Nanda and Sh. Rajesh Kumar Nanda, who were occupying a shop owned by Singh. Singh claimed that he required the shop for expanding his business of repairing electronic goods and that the tenants had an alternate shop and did not actually require the tenanted shop. The tenants filed an application for leave to contest the eviction petition, claiming that Singh had not come to the court with clean hands and had concealed material facts. They argued that they had a prima facie case in their favour and would suffer an irreparable loss if the leave was not granted to them.

In the second case, the landlord filed an eviction petition against the tenant, who denied any attempt to transfer tenancy rights or create third-party interest in the tenanted shop. The landlord filed a reply to the application, denying its contents and stating that the eviction was sought on the bonafide requirement of the landlord and his son. The court stated that in order to obtain leave to defend, the tenant must disclose material and substantial facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining the eviction order. The court also examined the ownership and relationship of the landlord and tenant, as well as the bonafide requirement and non-availability of reasonably suitable accommodation. The court heard arguments from both sides and will adjudicate the matter after cross-examination of witnesses.

In the third case, the court order stated that the petitioner needed the tenanted premises to expand his business and had no other suitable commercial accommodation. The respondents did not dispute this fact and had also acquired an alternate shop in the same area. The court dismissed the arguments raised by the respondents and passed an eviction order in favour of the petitioner. The respondents were directed to handover the vacant and peaceful possession of the tenanted shop. The petitioner could not obtain possession of the premises before the expiry of six months from the date of passing of this order.

In the fourth case, the court dismissed an application filed by the respondent seeking permission to defend an eviction petition. An eviction order was passed in favour of the petitioner, directing the respondent to hand over the tenanted shop to the petitioner. The petitioner could not obtain possession of the shop before six months from the date of the order. The petition for eviction was disposed of, and there were no orders as to cost. The file would be consigned to the record room.
