The Taj Mahal is one of the most iconic and recognizable landmarks in the world. However, over the years, it has been subjected to significant damage and deterioration due to changing social and economic conditions that have aggravated the situation with even more formidable phenomena of damage or destruction. The pollution caused by industries in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) in Agra, which is a major tourist destination, has been a significant contributor to this damage. The court has been monitoring the situation for over three years and aims to protect the Taj Mahal from deterioration due to pollution.

The court order discusses the sources of pollution in the Agra region, including small and medium-scale industrial units, and the impact of air pollution on the Taj Mahal. The court directs the U.P. Pollution Control Board to conduct a survey of the area and issue notices to industries and foundries to install anti-pollution measures. The board later reports that 507 out of 511 listed industries were polluting and 212 were closed for failing to install pollution control devices. The NEERI report indicates that the deterioration of marble in the Taj Mahal is due to the cumulative effects of all pollutants, with sulfur dioxide being a major contributor. The report recommends the use of natural gas, improved sulfur recovery units, and the setting up of a green belt around the Mathura Refinery.

The court order also includes recommendations from the Varadharajan Committee to relocate existing small industries, particularly the foundries, in an area southeast of Agra beyond the Taj Mahal so that emissions from these industries will not be in the direction of the monuments. The court order highlights the need for preventive steps to be taken soon to protect the Taj Mahal. The court suggests finding the possibility of providing gas as a fuel to the glass industries and foundries around Agra. The Gas Authority of India is directed to send their terms of reference to NEERI for a feasibility study on the utilization of compressed natural gas (CNG) as a replacement for solid/liquid fuels.

The court orders the relocation of air-polluting industries outside of the Taj Trapezium in a phased manner and directs the U.P. State Pollution Control Board to issue public notices and individual notices to industries for the proposed shifting. The court also discusses the use of natural gas and LPG as alternative fuels and the need for stricter emissions standards. The order emphasizes the need for a clear development planning strategy and resources to implement major changes. The court also cites reports from experts and the Archaeological Survey of India on the impact of pollution on the Taj Mahal.

The court has ordered the relocation of industries from TTZ if they do not switch to natural gas as an industrial fuel. The court has also emphasized the importance of sustainable development and the need to protect the environment while promoting industry. The court has cited the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle as essential features of sustainable development. The order also mentions various constitutional mandates and legislations related to environmental protection.

The court order pertains to the pollution caused by industries in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) in Agra, which is a major tourist destination. The court has been monitoring the situation for over three years and aims to protect the Taj Mahal from deterioration due to pollution.

The court has also emphasized the importance of sustainable development and the need to protect the environment while promoting industry. The court has cited the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle as essential features of sustainable development.

The court orders 292 industries to switch to natural gas as an industrial fuel and those unable to obtain gas connections to stop functioning with the aid of coke/coal in the TTZ and relocate themselves. The court also provides directions for the relocation of industries, compensation for workmen, and monitoring of other issues related to controlling air pollution in the TTZ. The NEERI submitted a technical report recommending the relocation of small-scale polluting industries outside the Taj Trapezium and the provision of natural gas to industries in the Agra-Mathura region and Mathura Refinery. The Varadharajan Committee Report showed that efforts to relocate existing small industries in the area south-east of Agra beyond the Taj Mahal have not been successful. The report also showed that the level of Suspended Particulate Matters (SPM) in the Taj Mahal area is high.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed in this summary highlight the need for preventive steps to be taken soon to protect the Taj Mahal from pollution caused by industries in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) in Agra. The court has ordered the relocation of air-polluting industries outside of the Taj Trapezium in a phased manner and directs the U.P. State Pollution Control Board to issue public notices and individual notices to industries for the proposed shifting. The court has emphasized the importance of sustainable development and the need to protect the environment while promoting industry. The court has cited the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle as essential features of sustainable development. The order also mentions various constitutional mandates and legislations related to environmental protection.
