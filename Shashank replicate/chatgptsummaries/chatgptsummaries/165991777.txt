The court recently received a contempt petition from S. Havarasu against Mr. Kirubasankar for not complying with the court order dated 27.03.2017 made in W.P.No.7335 of 2017. The respondent filed a compliance affidavit stating that the Forest Department is operating Anaivari Muttal Ecotourism in the area to protect and conserve the ecosystem. The order of the court has been complied with by submitting a proposal for the de-silting and improvement of the wildlife habitat. The delay occurred due to the requirement of prior permission from the Central Government. The court closed the contempt petition after recording the compliance affidavit filed by the respondent.

The case in question pertains to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem in the Anaivari Muttal area. The Forest Department has been operating an ecotourism project in the area to ensure that the ecosystem is protected and conserved. However, there were concerns raised about the impact of the project on the wildlife habitat in the area. In response to these concerns, the court had issued an order on 27.03.2017, directing the Forest Department to submit a proposal for the de-silting and improvement of the wildlife habitat.

Despite the court order, there were delays in the submission of the proposal. This led to S. Havarasu filing a contempt petition against Mr. Kirubasankar, alleging that he had not complied with the court order. However, the respondent filed a compliance affidavit, stating that the delay occurred due to the requirement of prior permission from the Central Government. The affidavit also stated that the Forest Department had submitted a proposal for the de-silting and improvement of the wildlife habitat, thereby complying with the court order.

After recording the compliance affidavit filed by the respondent, the court closed the contempt petition. This means that the respondent has been found to have complied with the court order and will not face any further action. The closure of the contempt petition is a positive development for the Forest Department and the ecotourism project in the Anaivari Muttal area, as it ensures that the project can continue without any legal hurdles.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of balancing the need for development with the need for environmental protection. The ecotourism project in the Anaivari Muttal area is an example of how development can be carried out in a sustainable manner, without causing harm to the environment. The court order directing the Forest Department to submit a proposal for the de-silting and improvement of the wildlife habitat is a step towards ensuring that the project remains sustainable and environmentally friendly. The closure of the contempt petition is a positive development for all stakeholders involved, as it ensures that the project can continue without any legal hurdles.
