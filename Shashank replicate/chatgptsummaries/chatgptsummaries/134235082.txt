The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) filed a writ petition challenging the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) orders dated 17.08.2015 and 18.11.2015. The NGT had granted interim stay on the environmental clearance issued to BBMP for establishing a waste management project facility. The Supreme Court requested the High Court of Karnataka to dispose of the writ petition by the end of April 2017. The BBMP argued that the NGT should not have entertained the appeal filed by the first respondent and that the matter should be heard by the High Court. The BBMP's counsel relied on the Bombay High Court and Madras High Court's decisions to support their argument.

The High Court of Karnataka, in its order, stated that the power of judicial review under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India cannot be taken away by a law enacted by Parliament. The court also noted that Section 29 of the NGT Act does not exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226 and 227. However, the court also stated that the writ remedy should not be permitted to be availed of as a matter of course and that the petitioner must state reasons for bypassing the alternative remedy. The court also noted that the NGT has the authority to examine whether the BBMP has provided for safeguards in the pre-establishment stage of the plant in question.

The court order further stated that the NGT has the jurisdiction to challenge the environmental clearance order granted to a plant by the BBMP. The NGT has been created to handle environmental cases and has the authority to grant remedial measures if necessary. The BBMP has not challenged the jurisdiction of the NGT and has subjected itself to its authority. The court requested the NGT to take up the appeal on a day-to-day basis and dispose of it within two weeks. The on-going activities of the project are permitted to continue but are subject to the outcome of the appeal. The contempt proceedings are kept in abeyance until the disposal of the main matter.
