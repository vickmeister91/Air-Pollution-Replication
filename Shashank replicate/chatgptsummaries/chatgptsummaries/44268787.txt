The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by the applicants under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail. The applicants had been in custody since 26.5.2014 in connection with a wildlife protection act case. The learned counsel for the applicants submitted that they had been falsely implicated in the case and that all offences were triable by Magistrate. The charge sheet had already been filed, and the trial would take considerable time to conclude. The learned counsel for the State opposed the application. After considering the contentions raised by both parties and the overall facts and circumstances of the case, the court allowed the application and directed that the applicants be released on bail on their furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court for securing their presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The court order is significant as it deals with the issue of bail in a wildlife protection act case. The applicants had been in custody for a considerable period, and their counsel argued that they had been falsely implicated in the case. The court considered the contentions raised by both parties and the overall facts and circumstances of the case before allowing the application for bail.

The court's decision to grant bail was based on several factors. Firstly, the charge sheet had already been filed, and the trial would take considerable time to conclude. This meant that the applicants would have to remain in custody for an extended period if bail was not granted. Secondly, the learned counsel for the applicants argued that they had been falsely implicated in the case. While this argument was not conclusive, it did raise doubts about the veracity of the charges against the applicants. Finally, the learned counsel for the State opposed the application, but the court did not find their arguments compelling enough to deny bail.

The court's decision to grant bail was subject to certain conditions. The applicants were required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the committal Court/trial Court. This was to ensure that the applicants would appear before the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during the trial. Failure to comply with these conditions could result in the cancellation of bail.

In conclusion, the court order in question dealt with a bail application filed by the applicants under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for grant of bail in a wildlife protection act case. The court considered the contentions raised by both parties and the overall facts and circumstances of the case before allowing the application for bail. The court's decision to grant bail was subject to certain conditions, which were intended to ensure that the applicants would appear before the court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during the trial.
