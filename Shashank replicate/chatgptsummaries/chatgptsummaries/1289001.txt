In a case where the Assistant Collector of Central Excise, Madras, filed a petition to set aside a notice issued by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (Economic Offences-l) Egmore, Madras, under Section 165 of the Evidence Act, directing him to produce the recorded information regarding the commission of an offence and the order granting rewards, if any, the court held that recorded information about the commission of an offence against the public revenue and the order granting rewards to informants of such information are entitled to the immunity extended under Sections 124 and 125 of the Evidence Act. However, the court also held that the claim of privilege should not depend upon the contents of the particular document and that the trial court should decide whether the claim of privilege is not based upon a perverse, unjust or mala fide exercise of discretion.

The court order states that recorded information cannot be quashed and that the necessary details about the information have already been stated by a witness. The court also explains that the order granting rewards to an informant cannot be produced as it would require disclosing the name of the informant, which is protected under Section 125 of the Evidence Act. The court also notes that the question of whether a reward was paid to the informant is irrelevant to the trial. The court allows the petitioner to claim privilege regarding the recorded information and orders the trial court to dispose of the matter according to law.
