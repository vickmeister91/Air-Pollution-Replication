The Madras High Court received two writ petitions (W.P.Nos.33760 and 30212 of 2018) regarding the construction of an arch of M.G.Ramachandran Centenary Arch encroaching Kamarajar Salai just opposite to the office of Public Works Department, Chepauk, Chennai. The petitions requested the court to remove the encroachment and quash the approval and grant of planning permission by the 1st respondent. The court heard arguments from both the petitioner and respondents and reserved judgment.

The court order pertains to a public interest litigation filed by a petitioner seeking the removal of an arch erected in the name of a former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on Kamarajar Salai, a major arterial road in Chennai. The petitioner argues that the arch encroaches on the road and violates the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001. The court has allowed the construction of the arch to proceed but has prohibited its inauguration until the writ petition is disposed of. The matter is ongoing.

The court order states that the construction of an arch to commemorate the birth centenary year of the former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. M.G. Ramachandran, across Kamarajar Salai cannot be inaugurated until the counter affidavit with supporting documents are filed in W.P.No.33760 of 2018. The government has filed its counter, stating that the proposal for the arch satisfies the Development Regulations Parameters and Coastal Regulations. The proposal was examined by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority and the Greater Chennai Corporation, and the competent authority, the Revenue Department, Government of Tamil Nadu, issued orders for the construction of the arch.

The Revenue Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu issued orders for the construction of an arch, and the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority granted planning clearance. The arch is being erected by the government, and the relevant provision is Section 58 of the Tamil Nadu Town and Country Planning Act, 1971. The site under reference comes under CRZ-II, and CRZ-II norms were found to be satisfied. The government has already issued orders to the Commissioner of Police to grant NOC. The challenge to the construction of the arch is primarily on the grounds of violation of various acts and regulations. The government argues that the arch is not an encroachment on government land.

The court order discusses the definition of "encroachment" under the Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001, and how it applies to the erection of an arch on a highway. The court also requested a list of highways maintained by the Highways Department in Chennai.

The court order lists various roads in Chennai City and their respective lengths, classifications, and speed limits. The roads include GST Road, Grand Western Trunk Road, GNT Road, Inner Ring Road, East Coast Road, Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Pallavaram Thorapakkam Road, Southern Sector Inner Ring Road, Marmalong Bridge, Irumbuliyur Road, Mount Medavakkam Road, Velacherry Bye-Pass Road, Taramani Link Road, and Medavakkam-Sholinganallur-Kudimiyandi Thoppu Road.

The court order lists various roads in Chennai, including their length and classification. It also includes roads in Thiruvallur and their classification.

The court order lists various roads in the Chennai and Thiruvallur areas, along with their classifications and lengths. The roads include state highways, district roads, and major roads. The order also includes the division and classification of each road.

The court order lists various roads in Thiruvallur district, including their names, lengths, and whether they are district roads or other roads. The order does not provide any further information or context.

The court order discusses a list of roads and their classifications, stating that the road where an arch is being constructed is not a highway and therefore not subject to the Tamil Nadu Highways Act. The court also cites a previous judgment that prohibits obstructions in streets under the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act. The petitioner's argument that the previous judgment should be extended to all districts in Tamil Nadu is rejected.

The court order allows for certain projections and erections in public places, subject to conditions and restrictions set by the Commissioner. The order also states that no obstruction or projection can be built in a street or public place without permission. The court found that the proposed construction of an arch in Rajaji Salai would not cause hindrance to traffic or pedestrians and would not be considered an obstruction or encroachment on a public street. The Corporation of Chennai was not found to have exceeded its jurisdiction in granting permission for the construction of the arch.

The court order states that the petitioner did not challenge the resolution allowing the construction of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly's Diamond Jubilee Memorial Arch, and therefore the petitioner's claim that the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act was violated cannot be accepted. The court also ruled that the arch does not violate the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, which divides the coastal area into four zones and allows for certain construction activities in each zone. The order includes the norms for regulation of activities permissible under the notification.

The court order outlines regulations for development and construction activities in different categories of Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ). No new construction is allowed in CRZ-I except for specific projects, and areas between Low
