The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by T.N.S.S. Steels Pvt. Ltd. against the Union of India, the Central Pollution Control Board, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, the State Coastal Zone Management Authority, the Tamil Nadu Maritime Board, and the State Port Officer. The petitioner challenged the order of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, which prohibited ship breaking activities at Valinokkam due to environmental concerns. The petitioner argued that ship breaking activities were permissible under the environmental guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board. The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board argued that ship breaking activities were highly polluting and posed a threat to the environment and the health of workers.

The court ordered that the petitioner must obtain consent from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board before continuing ship breaking activities. The court order states that the petitioner-industry was ordered not to carry out ship breaking activities without obtaining consent from the TNPCB under the Water Act and Air Act. The industry did not comply with this order, and the court has now dismissed their writ petitions.

The court also discussed the jurisdiction of the Central Government to preserve and protect the marine environment and prevent marine pollution in the Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone, and the Environmental Guidelines for Ship Breaking Industries issued by the CPCB. The TNPCB's direction to obtain consent was deemed valid, and the court rejected the petitioner's argument that the TNPCB had no authority to issue such a direction.

The court's decision was based on the fact that ship breaking activities are highly polluting and pose a threat to the environment and the health of workers. The court recognized the importance of protecting the marine environment and preventing marine pollution in the Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone. The court also recognized the importance of following the Environmental Guidelines for Ship Breaking Industries issued by the CPCB.

The court's decision is significant because it recognizes the importance of protecting the environment and the health of workers. The court's decision also recognizes the importance of following environmental guidelines and obtaining consent from the appropriate authorities before carrying out activities that may be harmful to the environment.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's decision in the case of T.N.S.S. Steels Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India, Central Pollution Control Board, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, State Coastal Zone Management Authority, Tamil Nadu Maritime Board, and State Port Officer is a significant step towards protecting the environment and the health of workers. The court's decision recognizes the importance of following environmental guidelines and obtaining consent from the appropriate authorities before carrying out activities that may be harmful to the environment. The court's decision is a reminder that we must all do our part to protect the environment and prevent pollution.
