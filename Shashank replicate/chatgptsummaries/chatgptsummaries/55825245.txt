The first court order pertains to a case where the accused petitioner, Sharad Chandra, approached the court after being aggrieved by the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Jodhpur District, Jodhpur in Sessions Case No.152/2013. The petitioner is facing trial for various offences, and there is a serious contest between the accused and the prosecution regarding the age of the victim. The accused claims that the victim was above 18 years of age and thus, the prosecution of the accused under the POCSO Act is unwarranted. The accused petitioner prayed for summoning various documents to prove and establish that the victim was above 18 years of age and also to demonstrate that the investigating agency had not acted fairly and was in collusion with the complainant.

The court heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and set aside the order passed by the trial court. The court directed that the documents mentioned in the body of this order be summoned by the Trial Court for such use as may be legally permissible on behalf of the defence. The trial court's order appears to be anomalous and suffers from non-application of mind. The accused had sought to summon Rojnamcha entries maintained by the police department, which were allowed to be exhibited during cross-examination of the investigating officer under protest by the prosecution. The accused has a right to establish before the trial court that the victim was above 18 years of age on the date of occurrence, and school records or other contemporaneous documents could be relevant and material for reaching a just conclusion. The documents sought by the petitioner under Section 91 Cr.P.C. are definitely relevant to the controversy prevailing before the trial court.

The second court order discusses a case where the accused had requested certain documents to be produced in court, but the trial court had allowed copies of the documents to be exhibited under protest. The accused had hoped that the investigating agency would produce the original documents, but this did not happen. The court states that the accused can only question the witness regarding the circumstances emanating from such documents without actually confronting the investigating officer with the document. The court directs the trial court to summon the original documents copies whereof have been allowed to be exhibited under protest, and the accused shall be entitled to prove these documents by examining the concerned witnesses in defense. The accused cannot claim a transcription of the recorded statement of the victim at this stage.

The third court order pertains to a case where a person's name was wrongly included in a list of beneficiaries for a government scheme. The court has ordered the concerned authorities to rectify the mistake and remove the person's name from the list. The order also mentions the dates of various hearings and the legal provisions under which the decision was made.

In summary, the first court order deals with a case where the accused is facing trial for various offences, and there is a serious contest between the accused and the prosecution regarding the age of the victim. The court directed that the documents mentioned in the order be summoned by the trial court for such use as may be legally permissible on behalf of the defence. The second court order deals with a case where the accused had requested certain documents to be produced in court, but the trial court had allowed copies of the documents to be exhibited under protest. The court directed the trial court to summon the original documents copies whereof have been allowed to be exhibited under protest, and the accused shall be entitled to prove these documents by examining the concerned witnesses in defense.
