The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by a man named Shivshankar under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Shivshankar is currently in jail for his alleged involvement in a case registered at Police Station- Police Forest Tiger Strike Force, District-Jabalpur for an offence punishable under Sections 2, 9, 39, 44, 48-A, 49-B, 51, 52 and 57 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleges that Shivshankar was carrying parts of the schedule A animal Pangolin, which is about to become extinct.

Shivshankar had filed a bail application in the court, seeking release from jail. However, the court found no change in circumstances that would warrant his release on bail and dismissed his application. The court's decision was based on the fact that Shivshankar was accused of a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, which is a non-bailable offence. The court also noted that the prosecution had presented strong evidence against Shivshankar, which made it difficult for him to be released on bail.

The court's decision to dismiss Shivshankar's bail application is in line with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which states that bail can only be granted in cases where the accused is not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence. In Shivshankar's case, the court found that there was a high likelihood of him absconding or tampering with evidence, given the serious nature of the offence he was accused of.

The court's decision also takes into account the fact that the Pangolin is an endangered species and that the possession of its parts is a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court's decision to deny bail to Shivshankar sends a strong message to those who engage in the illegal trade of wildlife and highlights the need for stricter enforcement of wildlife protection laws.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Shivshankar's bail application is a reflection of the seriousness of the offence he is accused of and the need to protect endangered species like the Pangolin. The court's decision also underscores the importance of enforcing wildlife protection laws and sending a strong message to those who engage in the illegal trade of wildlife.
