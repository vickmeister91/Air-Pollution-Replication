The court order pertains to a review petition filed by Saji M. Mathew against a judgment in a writ petition. The writ petition was filed to challenge the cancellation of a quarrying lease granted to the petitioner.

The petitioner's contention regarding the validity of the cancellation order was not examined, but the court found no reason to reconsider the objections raised by the Forest Department.

The court order states that there was no material furnished to the writ petitioner regarding the validity of the permit granted. The objections raised by the forest department were considered and decided, and there was no reason for reconsideration based on other materials not provided to the petitioner. The court dismissed the review petition as there was no violation of natural justice in passing the order. The court also considered the ecological importance and wildlife movement in the area and the potential hazards of quarrying.
