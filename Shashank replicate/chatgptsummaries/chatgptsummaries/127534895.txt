The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a criminal complaint filed against the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited for allegedly running a thermal power plant without a valid environmental clearance. The complaint was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Janjgir-Champa, and the petitioner has filed a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC to challenge the dismissal. The case involves violations of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986; the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981; and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

In another court order, the complaint was filed against 25 individuals, including present and former directors of Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited, for allegedly running a power plant without a valid environmental clearance. The complaint was dismissed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, and the petitioner has filed a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC to set aside the order and register a criminal complaint. The respondents have argued that the complaint is not maintainable without arraigning the company itself as a party and demonstrating their role and incriminating material against them. The court has heard arguments from both sides and will make a decision.

The court order discusses whether the complaint alleging vicarious liability of respondents is maintainable without arraigning the company itself as a party and without demonstrating their role and incriminating material against them. The court considers the provisions contained in Section 16 of the Environment (Protection) Act, Section 40 of the Air Act, and Section 47 of the Water Act. The court concludes that arraigning the company in the complaint as an accused was imperative, as the principal allegation has been made against the company, and the offence is said to have been committed by the company under the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, the Water Act, and the Air Act. Therefore, the directors and other officers of the company have been arraigned making them as accused in the complaint vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company.

The court order explains that if a company commits an offence, the officers of the company who were responsible for the conduct of the business are also liable for the offence. The arraignment of the company as an accused is necessary to prosecute the officers who were directly in charge. The principle of "alter ego" can be used to hold controlling parties of a corporation personally liable. The Supreme Court has held that arraigning a company as an accused is imperative for maintaining a prosecution. The court order cites various cases to support this proposition.

The court order states that in order to prosecute a company for an offense, the company must be arraigned as an accused in the complaint. The court cites previous cases to support this ruling and dismisses the current complaint for not following this requirement. The court also notes that the petitioner should be careful in the future and warns against roping in senior officers without adequate incriminating evidence. No cost is imposed on the petitioner in this case.

In the final court order, the petitioner has promised to be careful in the future and not repeat their actions. The court has decided not to impose any costs on the petitioner but has warned them to be careful in the future.

In summary, the court orders discussed in this summary pertain to a criminal complaint filed against the Chhattisgarh State Power Generation Company Limited for allegedly running a thermal power plant without a valid environmental clearance. The court has emphasized the importance of arraigning the company as an accused in the complaint to prosecute the officers who were directly in charge. The court has dismissed the current complaint for not following this requirement and has warned the petitioner to be careful in the future.
