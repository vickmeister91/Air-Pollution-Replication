The court order in question pertains to a writ application filed by Sanjay Kumar Choudhary, a Non-Resident Indian (N.R.I.), who sought to quash a notice issued by the Special Judge (Vigilance), Ranchi, directing him to deposit his passport within a week of receipt of the notice. The petitioner argued that the order was without jurisdiction and illegal, and if carried out, would infringe his fundamental right to liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The court found that the order suffered from illegality and was fit to be set aside. However, the court directed the petitioner to produce his passport before the court within a week so that it could be returned on the 7th day of its production after verification by the Investigating Officer. This decision was made by Justice R.R. Prasad.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the order to deposit the passport was without jurisdiction and illegal. The court found that the Special Judge (Vigilance), Ranchi, did not have the power to issue such an order, as the petitioner was an N.R.I. and his passport was issued by the Indian Embassy in the country where he resided. The court also noted that the order was not supported by any legal provision or authority.

The court further observed that the order, if carried out, would infringe the petitioner's fundamental right to liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The court held that the right to travel abroad is an integral part of the right to personal liberty, and any restriction on this right must be in accordance with law and must be reasonable.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the order directing the petitioner to deposit his passport. However, the court directed the petitioner to produce his passport before the court within a week so that it could be returned on the 7th day of its production after verification by the Investigating Officer. This was done to ensure that the petitioner's passport was not being used for any illegal purposes.

The court order also disposed of the writ application and ordered that the petitioner be informed of the decision through FAX at their own expense. This was done to ensure that the petitioner was informed of the court's decision in a timely manner.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the fact that the order to deposit the petitioner's passport was without jurisdiction and illegal, and would infringe his fundamental right to liberty. The court set aside the order and directed the petitioner to produce his passport before the court within a week so that it could be returned on the 7th day of its production after verification by the Investigating Officer. The court also disposed of the writ application and ordered that the petitioner be informed of the decision through FAX at their own expense.
