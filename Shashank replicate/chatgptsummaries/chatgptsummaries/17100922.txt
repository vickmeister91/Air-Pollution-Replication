The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two cases, CWPIL No. 27 of 2017 and CWPIL No. 13 of 2015. The applicants in the case had requested to be impleaded as party respondents and for necessary directions to be issued to restore electricity and water connection to their hotels, stay homes, and restaurants, which had been closed down by the authorities for operating without permission.

The court did not grant any interim relief but allowed the applicants to approach relevant authorities within two days to consider and decide their cases if they had the requisite permission to run their establishments. The authorities were directed to restore electricity and water connection if the applicants fulfilled the criteria for setting up and running hotels. The court disposed of all the applications.

In the second case, CWPIL No. 13 of 2015, the court ordered for a fresh status report to be filed before the next hearing, which is scheduled for September 27th, 2018. Mr. Vivek Sharma represented the Amicus Curiae, and Mr. Ajay Vaidya represented the State.

The court's decision in the first case is significant as it provides a pathway for the applicants to have their establishments reopened if they meet the necessary criteria. The court's decision also highlights the importance of obtaining the proper permissions and licenses before operating a business.

In the second case, the court's order for a fresh status report indicates that the case is ongoing and that further action may be taken in the future. The involvement of an Amicus Curiae and a representative for the State suggests that the case may have broader implications beyond the specific parties involved.

Overall, the court's orders in these two cases demonstrate the importance of following proper procedures and obtaining necessary permissions and licenses when operating a business. The court's decisions also highlight the role of the judiciary in ensuring that laws and regulations are followed and that justice is served.
