The Lokayukta report and satellite imagery were used as evidence to file an FIR and seize equipment, iron ore, and vehicles. The court found that the Lokayukta report and satellite imagery could be used as evidence, but the petitioner should have been given an opportunity to be heard before initiating action. The court also found that the forest authorities had the right to initiate action against those who violate the lease agreement and conditions of the KP Act, and to seize and confiscate forest produce, tools, vehicles, and machineries used for illegal removal of forest produce. The court did not quash the FIR at this stage and allowed further investigation to proceed.
