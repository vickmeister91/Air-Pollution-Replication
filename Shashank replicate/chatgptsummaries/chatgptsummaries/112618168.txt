The Karnataka High Court recently issued two court orders related to stone crushing units in the state. The first order was related to a petition filed by M/S PBI Contractors and Engineers, seeking a direction to the respondents to consider their representation for a temporary license to operate their stone crusher unit without insisting on shifting to a safer zone. The second order was related to a petition filed by M/S Sri Shivaganga Stone Crushing Industriy, seeking permission to operate their stone crushing unit in the present location.

In the first case, the court noted that the applications for licenses under the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, must be considered within three months, and existing units must shift to safer zones within six months of receiving a license. The court disposed of the petition in accordance with an earlier writ petition and directed the licensing authority to dispose of the petitioner's application within the prescribed time frame.

The court also noted that the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, was enacted to regulate the operation of stone crushers in the state and provide for the licensing of stone crushers. The Act requires that all existing stone crushers in the state must shift to safer zones within a specified time frame. The Act also provides for the establishment of a licensing authority to regulate the operation of stone crushers in the state.

In the second case, the court order stated that any government project or public-private partnership project can be granted if they fulfill the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and Environmental Protection Act, 1986. The authorities were directed to consider the petitioner's representation and pass necessary orders within 10 days. If the petitioner's unit falls under Section 7 of the Act, then orders should be passed accordingly. Until then, the petitioner cannot carry on their stone crushing activity in the present location.

The court noted that the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, was enacted to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution in the country. The Act provides for the establishment of a Central Pollution Control Board and State Pollution Control Boards to regulate air pollution in the country. The Environmental Protection Act, 1986, was enacted to provide for the protection and improvement of the environment and for the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants, and property.

The court orders are significant as they provide clarity on the regulation of stone crushing units in the state. The orders emphasize the importance of complying with the provisions of the Karnataka Regulation of Stone Crushers Act, 2011, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and Environmental Protection Act, 1986.
