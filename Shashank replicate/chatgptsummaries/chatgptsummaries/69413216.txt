The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Naseem Khan and others in connection with offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court considered the allegations against the petitioners and the material available on record and observed that while the allegations prima facie seem to be made out, the offence alleged attracts a maximum punishment of three years, and arrest is not mandatory.

The court referred to guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Arnesh Kumar Vs. State of Bihar (2014) 8 SCC 273, which mandate that the police may resort to the extreme step of arrest only when necessary and the applicant does not cooperate in the investigation. The court directed that the petitioners should first be summoned to cooperate in the investigation, and if they cooperate, the occasion of their arrest should not arise. If arrest is inevitable, then the provisions of Section 41, 41-A should be followed as a condition precedent.

The anticipatory bail application was disposed of with these directions.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in cases of arrest and bail.

This highlights the fact that cooperation in investigations can go a long way in avoiding unnecessary arrests and detentions.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the provisions of Section 41, 41-A as a condition precedent to arrest. This ensures that the police follow due process and do not resort to arbitrary arrests.
