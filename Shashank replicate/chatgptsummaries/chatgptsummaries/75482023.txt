The Madras High Court recently issued a court order in a batch of cases where manufacturers of fly ash bricks challenged the collection of service charges by the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Ltd. (TANGEDCO) for the supply of fly ash. The TANGEDCO had challenged a memorandum issued by the Deputy Director, Fly Ash Utilisation, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi, but the challenge failed. The court held that the TANGEDCO is bound to obey the directions issued in the Official Memorandum.

The petitioners in the case were manufacturers of fly ash bricks who had entered into agreements with the TANGEDCO for the supply of fly ash. The TANGEDCO had been collecting service charges from the petitioners for the supply of fly ash, which the petitioners challenged as being illegal and arbitrary. The petitioners argued that the TANGEDCO had no legal authority to collect service charges for the supply of fly ash, as the same was being supplied to them free of cost by the TANGEDCO.

The TANGEDCO, on the other hand, argued that the collection of service charges was justified as it was in accordance with the memorandum issued by the Deputy Director, Fly Ash Utilisation, Ministry of Environment and Forests, New Delhi. The TANGEDCO had challenged the memorandum on the grounds that it was not binding on them, but the challenge failed.

The court, after considering the arguments of both parties, held that the TANGEDCO was bound to obey the directions issued in the Official Memorandum. The court observed that the memorandum was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, which is a statutory authority, and therefore, the TANGEDCO was bound to comply with the same. The court also noted that the memorandum was issued in public interest, with the objective of promoting the use of fly ash in the construction industry, and therefore, the collection of service charges by the TANGEDCO was justified.

The court further held that the collection of service charges by the TANGEDCO was not arbitrary or illegal, as the same was being done in accordance with the memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court observed that the petitioners had entered into agreements with the TANGEDCO for the supply of fly ash, and therefore, they were bound to pay the service charges for the same.

In light of the above, the court allowed the writ petitions filed by the petitioners and made the interim orders already granted absolute. The court directed the TANGEDCO to continue to supply fly ash to the petitioners and collect service charges for the same in accordance with the memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Madras High Court in the batch of cases involving the collection of service charges by the TANGEDCO for the supply of fly ash has clarified the legal position on the issue. The court has held that the TANGEDCO is bound to obey the directions issued in the Official Memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and that the collection of service charges by the TANGEDCO is justified and not arbitrary or illegal. The court has also directed the TANGEDCO to continue to supply fly ash to the petitioners and collect service charges for the same in accordance with the memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.
