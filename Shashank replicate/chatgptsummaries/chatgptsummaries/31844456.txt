The State of Rajasthan filed a writ petition against Gopi Krishan and others challenging an order passed by the Board of Revenue. The order upheld the cancellation of land allotments made in favor of various persons. The land in question was declared a protected forest, but due to a printing mistake, it was allotted to private cultivators. The Forest Department was not impleaded separately before the courts below or before the Board of Revenue, and therefore, the fact that the land was reserved/protected forest could not be brought before the courts.

The court agreed with the State of Rajasthan and granted the petitioner State through the Forest Department the liberty to move the Board of Revenue with an appropriate application and relevant documents.
