The State of Himachal Pradesh has filed an application to carry out silviculture felling in Chil Pine, Khair, and broad-leaved forests up to an elevation of 1500 meters above Mean Sea Level (MSL). This application was made despite a previous court order banning felling of trees in any forest, public or private. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) has recommended limited permission for silvicultural fellings, including thinning in the State of Himachal Pradesh, with specific guidelines for felling operations. The State has identified Nurpur Forest Range of Nurpur Forest Division for felling of Khair trees.

The court has allowed limited silviculture felling of trees in Himachal Pradesh, with strict conditions to protect the forests. The felling will be monitored by a two-member committee and will be done directly by the Forest Department or the Himachal Pradesh State Forest Corporation. The State must ensure that at least 25% of mature Khair trees are retained as mother trees, and at least 40 mature trees are retained per hectare for Chil Pine and Sal trees. The State must also ensure adequate funds for re-afforestation and protection of forest areas from grazing. The committee must submit a report to the court every six months.
