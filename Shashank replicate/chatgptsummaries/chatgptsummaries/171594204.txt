The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Maharaja Minerals and Chemicals and other petitioners challenging an order passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The order in question revoked their consent to operate under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981 and directed for closure under Section 31A of the Act. The court held that the order could be challenged by filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act and, if grievances were still not remedied, by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act.

The case involved the operation of a chemical plant by Maharaja Minerals and Chemicals and other petitioners. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board had granted consent to operate the plant under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, after receiving complaints from local residents about pollution and environmental damage caused by the plant, the Board conducted an inspection and found that the plant was not complying with the conditions of the consent. As a result, the Board revoked the consent to operate and directed for closure of the plant under Section 31A of the Act.

The petitioners challenged the order of the Board by filing a writ petition before the Rajasthan High Court. They argued that the order was arbitrary, illegal, and without jurisdiction. They also contended that the Board had not given them an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The petitioners further argued that the order violated their fundamental right to carry on their business and trade under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.

The Rajasthan High Court, however, rejected these arguments and dismissed the writ petition. The court held that the order of the Board was not arbitrary, illegal, or without jurisdiction. The court noted that the Board had conducted an inspection and found that the plant was not complying with the conditions of the consent. The court also observed that the petitioners had not challenged the findings of the inspection report. The court further held that the petitioners had an alternative remedy of filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act. The court noted that the Appellate Authority had the power to set aside or modify the order of the Board. The court also held that if the grievances of the petitioners were still not remedied, they could file an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act.

The court also rejected the argument of the petitioners that their fundamental right to carry on their business and trade was violated by the order of the Board. The court held that the right to carry on business and trade was subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public health and safety. The court observed that the order of the Board was passed to protect the environment and the health of the local residents. The court held that the order was a reasonable restriction on the right to carry on business and trade.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Maharaja Minerals and Chemicals and other petitioners challenging the order of the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board revoking their consent to operate under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981 and directing for closure under Section 31A of the Act. The court held that the order could be challenged by filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act and, if grievances were still not remedied, by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act. The court also held that the order of the Board was not arbitrary, illegal, or without jurisdiction and that the right to carry on business and trade was subject to reasonable restrictions in the interest of public health and safety.
