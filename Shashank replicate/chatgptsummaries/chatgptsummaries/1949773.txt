The Fishermen Co-Operative Society filed a writ petition against the A.P. Pollution Control Board and the Environmental Engineer for allowing industries to discharge untreated effluents into Pedda Cheruvu Tank, resulting in the loss of fish wealth due to pollution. The Society sought damages of Rs. 20,00,000/- for the loss of fish wealth for the fishing year 1998-99. The report filed by the Environmental Engineer stated that there is a possibility of effluents getting discharged into Pedda Cheruvu, and none of the industries have foolproof effluent treatment plants. The court found that the industries have no right to discharge industrial effluents into Pedda Cheruvu tank, and the fishing rights in Pedda Cheruvu tank are being leased out by Fisheries Department. The court also referred to Rule 3(3A) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1996, which states that if the standards for discharge of effluents are not prescribed, the standards in Schedule VI are applicable.

The court order pertains to the discharge of effluents into surface water sources and the standards that need to be followed. The court emphasizes the importance of balancing environmental concerns with developmental activities and the need for sustainable development. The court also highlights the limited scope of judicial review in matters involving technical and scientific knowledge. The court concludes that further investigation and tests are required to determine the cause of fish deaths in Pedda Cheruvu tank and directs respondent No.1 to conduct an Environment Management Study/Environment Impact Study.
