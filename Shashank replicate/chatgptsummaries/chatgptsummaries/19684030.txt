In a writ petition filed by Anie Babu and others against the State of Kerala and various other respondents, the court order pertains to concerns raised by citizens living near quarries about the damage caused to their property and buildings. The quarries are necessary for construction activities, but the citizens label them as illegal and a nuisance to their lives. The court had issued an interim order staying the operation of the quarry due to the party respondents not having an Environmental Clearance (EC). The quarry owners argue that the government had undertaken before the Supreme Court to renew all quarrying licenses. The court examines the need for an EC for mining operations and the various government orders and notifications related to it. The court also notes the undertaking made by the government before the Supreme Court and recorded by the Hon'ble Supreme Court.

The court order discusses a dispute over the requirement for environmental clearance (EC) for quarrying operations in areas below 5 hectares in Kerala, India. The quarry owners argue that an undertaking made by the state government and recorded by the Supreme Court means that EC is not required for quarrying operations in these areas. However, the court finds that the undertaking was made in the context of a specific case and does not override the requirement for EC under national laws and regulations. The court also notes that the state government has attempted to grant short-term permits for quarrying operations in violation of the law and principles of sustainable development. The court ultimately rules that EC is required for all quarrying operations, regardless of area size.

The court order states that environmental clearance is not required for renewal of quarrying permits for granite quarries that had a valid permit during the financial year 2014-15. The court also rejected the argument that an undertaking made by the state allows for permits to be granted without environmental clearance. The court examined the facts of each case and found that permits issued without environmental clearance were illegal.

The court order states that quarrying permits issued to the 7th and 8th respondents are illegal as they do not have an EC and the land is within the buffer zone of the Talacauvery Wildlife Sanctuary. The permits issued after 2012 were without EC and cannot be considered renewals. The 9th respondent also cannot carry on quarrying operations as their permits go against the provisions of the MMDR Act and the MMCR of 2015. The writ petitions are allowed, and the parties are restrained from carrying on any quarry operations based on the illegal permits.

The court order highlights the importance of environmental clearance for quarrying operations and the need to follow national laws and regulations. The court also emphasizes the principles of sustainable development and the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision to disallow quarrying operations based on illegal permits is a step towards ensuring that the environment is protected and citizens' rights are upheld. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to the government and quarry owners to follow the law and obtain necessary clearances before carrying out any mining operations.
