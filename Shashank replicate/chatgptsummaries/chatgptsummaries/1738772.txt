The case in question involves a civil suit filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh and its functionaries against the defendants, who had obtained a decree through a compromise reached in a previous suit. The trial judge decreed the suit and set aside the judgment and decree passed in the previous suit, finding that the compromise was unlawful and the defendants had obtained the decree fraudulently. The defendants appealed the judgment and decree passed by the Second Additional District Judge in Betul, Madhya Pradesh, arguing that the suit was not maintainable.

The court, in its ruling, held that the suit was not maintainable, but directed the trial judge to treat the plaint as an application for setting aside the judgment and decree passed in the earlier suit by way of compromise and proceed as per law. This means that the defendants will have the opportunity to challenge the previous judgment and decree, but they will have to do so through an application rather than a separate suit.

The court's decision was based on the principle that a party cannot file a separate suit to challenge a judgment and decree that has already been passed. Instead, they must file an application to set aside the judgment and decree. The court also noted that the defendants had not challenged the previous judgment and decree within the prescribed time limit, which further supported the decision to treat the plaint as an application.

Overall, the court's ruling provides clarity on the proper procedure for challenging a judgment and decree passed in a previous suit. It also emphasizes the importance of adhering to the prescribed time limit for challenging such judgments and decrees.
