However, the court refused to mark the copies of the said documents in evidence.

The petitioner had made a further application to the said police, under the Right to Information Act, wherein in reply an endorsement has been issued that there is no such document. The court found the application inexplicable and disposed of the petition without prejudice to the case of the petitioner.
