The court order in question pertains to an application filed by Smt. Neha Agrawal against her husband Shaurya Agrawal under Section 482 of CrPC. The application was filed against the order passed by the Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Gwalior, rejecting Neha's application under Section 91 of CrPC for calling the documents pertaining to the salary slips of the institutions mentioned in the application in which Shaurya had earlier worked.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce a document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. In this case, Neha had sought the production of Shaurya's salary slips from his previous employers in order to establish his income for the purposes of maintenance.

The court directed Shaurya to file an affidavit mentioning specifically whether he had ever worked with the institutions mentioned in the application filed under Section 91 of CrPC or not and if so, then what was his salary. This was done in order to establish the veracity of Neha's claims and to ensure that Shaurya was not withholding any information that could be relevant to the case.

The court's decision to direct Shaurya to file an affidavit was based on the principle of natural justice, which requires that both parties to a dispute be given an opportunity to present their case and be heard. By directing Shaurya to file an affidavit, the court was ensuring that he had an opportunity to present his side of the case and to provide any information that could be relevant to the matter at hand.

The court's decision to dispose of the application with this clarification was based on the fact that the information provided by Shaurya in his affidavit would be sufficient to establish his income for the purposes of maintenance. The court was satisfied that the information provided by Shaurya would be adequate to determine the amount of maintenance that he would be required to pay to Neha.

Overall, the court's decision in this matter was based on the principles of natural justice and fairness. By directing Shaurya to file an affidavit, the court ensured that both parties had an opportunity to present their case and to provide any information that could be relevant to the matter at hand. The court's decision to dispose of the application with this clarification was based on the fact that the information provided by Shaurya in his affidavit would be sufficient to establish his income for the purposes of maintenance.
