The court order in question pertains to a case where a two-wheeler was seized for transporting Indian made foreign liquor. The owner of the vehicle filed an appeal against the confiscation of the vehicle, but it was rejected as it was filed after the specified period of 30 days. The petitioner then filed a writ petition seeking a direction to not proceed with the seizure of the vehicle until the appeal is disposed of. However, the court dismissed the writ petition as there was no power in the appellate authority to condone the delay in filing the appeal. The court also held that the order directing the petitioner to produce the vehicle and ordering its seizure was not illegal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to provide any valid reason for the delay in filing the appeal. The court further held that the appellate authority did not have the power to condone the delay in filing the appeal, and therefore, the appeal was rightly rejected.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of adhering to the specified time limits for filing appeals. The court's decision also underscores the fact that the appellate authority does not have the power to condone the delay in filing an appeal. This means that if an appeal is not filed within the specified time limit, it will be rejected, and the order of the lower court will stand.

It is important for litigants to be aware of the time limits for filing appeals and to ensure that they file their appeals within the specified time limit. Failure to do so can result in the appeal being rejected, and the order of the lower court being upheld.
