On December 27, 2018, a court order was issued in response to multiple writ petitions filed by individuals against the State of Himachal Pradesh and the Union of India. The cases involved individuals who were occupying government land without authorization and were ordered to be evicted. While the facts of each case were different, the authorities had given concurrent findings that the petitioners were encroachers on government land.

The petitioners relied on a notification issued by the government of Himachal Pradesh in 2017, which indicated that the state government was contemplating a policy decision to regularize possession over government land in certain cases. The court acknowledged that some of the encroachers were landless and homeless, while others were small and marginalized landowners.

The court refrained from expressing views on the matter and left it to the policy makers to take an appropriate decision. However, the state government was directed to take a final decision on the conferment of proprietary rights on unauthorized occupants of government land within three months. The decision-making process involved more than one government department, and a meeting of all principal secretaries of such departments was directed to be convened.

The final decision must keep in view public interest and cannot give preference to individual hardship. The policy decision will be subject to judicial review, and till then, status quo shall be maintained.
