The Andhra Pradesh High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Onteddu Krishna Reddy against the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding the establishment and operation of an industry by the 7th respondent without complying with statutory obligations. The petitioner had alleged that the 7th respondent had not obtained the necessary clearances and permissions from the authorities before starting the construction of the industry.

During the hearing, the court was informed that as of the date of the report, the 7th respondent had only taken steps to construct a compound wall and no activity related to the establishment or operation of the industry was noticed. The court observed that the petitioner had failed to provide any concrete evidence to support his allegations and that the respondent had not yet started any activity related to the industry.

The court further noted that the petitioner had not approached the authorities concerned with his grievances and had directly approached the court. The court stated that the petitioner should have first approached the authorities concerned and given them an opportunity to address his grievances before approaching the court.

The court dismissed the writ petition and closed any pending miscellaneous applications. No costs were awarded.

This judgment highlights the importance of following due process and approaching the appropriate authorities before approaching the court. It also emphasizes the need for concrete evidence to support allegations made in a writ petition. The court's decision to dismiss the petition in the absence of any evidence serves as a reminder that the burden of proof lies with the petitioner and that unsubstantiated allegations cannot be relied upon to obtain relief from the court.

Furthermore, the court's decision to not award any costs to either party indicates that the court did not find any merit in the petitioner's allegations and that the respondent had not acted in bad faith. This decision also serves as a reminder that parties should approach the court only after exhausting all other available remedies and that frivolous litigation will not be tolerated.

In conclusion, the Andhra Pradesh High Court's decision to dismiss the writ petition filed by Onteddu Krishna Reddy against the State of Andhra Pradesh regarding the establishment and operation of an industry by the 7th respondent without complying with statutory obligations highlights the importance of following due process and providing concrete evidence to support allegations made in a writ petition. The court's decision to not award any costs to either party also serves as a reminder that parties should approach the court only after exhausting all other available remedies and that frivolous litigation will not be tolerated.
