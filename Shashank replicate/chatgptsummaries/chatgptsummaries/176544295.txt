The Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB) had ordered the closure of a crushing unit belonging to B.P. Industries. The company challenged this order in court, arguing that it was passed without following the principles of natural justice and without complying with the procedure laid down under Section 21(4) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court granted an interim stay on the closure of the unit and directed the respondents to allow the petitioner to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing.

The petitioner, B.P. Industries, contended that the JSPCB had not given them a proper hearing before passing the closure order. They also argued that the JSPCB had not followed the procedure laid down under Section 21(4) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which requires the board to give the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before passing any order.

The court found merit in the petitioner's arguments and granted an interim stay on the closure of the unit. The court also directed the respondents to allow the petitioner to continue with its crushing activities until the next date of hearing. The court further directed the petitioner to implead the Union of India through the Ministry of Environment and Forest as respondent no.4 to the present petition.

The court's decision to grant an interim stay on the closure of the unit is significant as it allows B.P. Industries to continue with its operations until the next date of hearing. This is important for the company as it would have suffered significant losses if the closure order had been implemented immediately.

The court's direction to implead the Union of India through the Ministry of Environment and Forest as respondent no.4 to the present petition is also significant. This means that the Union of India will now be a party to the case and will have to respond to the petitioner's arguments. This is important as the Union of India is responsible for enforcing environmental laws in the country and its response to the petitioner's arguments will be crucial in determining the outcome of the case.

The case highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and the procedure laid down under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The JSPCB's failure to follow these principles and procedures led to the court granting an interim stay on the closure of the unit. This underscores the need for regulatory bodies to follow due process while enforcing environmental laws.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant an interim stay on the closure of the crushing unit belonging to B.P. Industries is significant as it allows the company to continue with its operations until the next date of hearing. The court's direction to implead the Union of India through the Ministry of Environment and Forest as respondent no.4 to the present petition is also important as it makes the Union of India a party to the case and requires it to respond to the petitioner's arguments. The case highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice and the procedure laid down under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, while enforcing environmental laws.
