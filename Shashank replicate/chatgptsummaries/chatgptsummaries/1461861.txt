The court order in question pertains to a mining lease granted within a reserved forest in Bihar. The petitioner had applied for renewal of the lease, but it had not been disposed of by the state government. The petitioner argued that they were entitled to carry on mining activities for a period of one year after the expiry of the lease in accordance with Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24-A of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. However, the court held that this rule did not apply in cases where the question of renewal lay within the domain of the Central Government, as was the case here.

The court also noted that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which requires prior approval of the Central Government for any grant of mining lease or renewal thereof within a forest area, was a special law that would prevail over the provisions of the Mineral Concession Rules. Therefore, the petitioner could not carry on any mining operation unless a fresh lease was granted in their favor upon obtaining prior approval of the Central Government. The court dismissed the application.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the legal position with respect to mining leases granted within forest areas. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a special law that has been enacted to protect forests and wildlife in the country. The Act requires prior approval of the Central Government for any grant of mining lease or renewal thereof within a forest area. This is to ensure that the environmental impact of such activities is assessed and mitigated before any mining operations are allowed to commence.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following due process in matters relating to mining leases. The petitioner had argued that they were entitled to carry on mining activities for a period of one year after the expiry of the lease in accordance with Sub-rule (6) of Rule 24-A of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. However, the court held that this rule did not apply in cases where the question of renewal lay within the domain of the Central Government. This underscores the need for mining lease holders to be aware of the legal framework governing their activities and to ensure that they comply with all relevant laws and regulations.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case clarifies the legal position with respect to mining leases granted within forest areas. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a special law that prevails over the provisions of the Mineral Concession Rules, and prior approval of the Central Government is required for any grant of mining lease or renewal thereof within a forest area. This decision underscores the importance of following due process in matters relating to mining leases and highlights the need for mining lease holders to be aware of the legal framework governing their activities.
