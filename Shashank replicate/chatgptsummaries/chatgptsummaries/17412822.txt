The Karnataka High Court recently issued an order to restore electricity supply to a building in Survey No.72/1. The building had been disconnected from the power supply based on an order passed by the second respondent under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, it was later discovered that the land in question was not the subject matter of the order.

The court directed the first respondent to restore the electricity supply to the building and allowed the appellant to challenge the Corrigendum dated 12th July 2019 in accordance with the law. The appeals were disposed of on the above terms.

The case highlights the importance of ensuring that orders are passed only after careful consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. In this case, the order to disconnect the electricity supply was based on a misunderstanding of the situation, which resulted in unnecessary inconvenience to the building's occupants.

The court's decision to restore the electricity supply and allow the appellant to challenge the Corrigendum is a positive step towards ensuring that justice is served in this case. It is important for all parties involved to follow due process and adhere to the law in order to avoid similar situations in the future.

Overall, the Karnataka High Court's order serves as a reminder of the importance of careful consideration and adherence to the law in all legal proceedings. It is essential for all parties involved to act in good faith and with due diligence in order to ensure that justice is served and the rights of all parties are protected.
