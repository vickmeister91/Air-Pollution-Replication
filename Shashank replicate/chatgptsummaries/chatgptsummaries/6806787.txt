The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving motor accidents and the liability of insurance companies to pay compensation to the victims or their families. In the first case, United India Insurance Co. Ltd. was held liable for the death of Ramanuj Prasad Singh and his daughter Priyanka Singh in a motor accident. The appellants filed appeals against the judgment and award passed by the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, raising two grounds of questioning. Firstly, they questioned whether the accident falls under the purview of Motor Accident Claim, and secondly, they questioned whether the deceased, who was driving the vehicle and died due to his own negligence, can be termed as a third party under the MV Act. The court heard both parties and reserved its judgment.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a claim case for compensation due to the death of two individuals in a motor accident. The owner of the vehicle, which was insured comprehensively, had given the vehicle to one of the deceased as a friendly gesture without hire on demand. The insurance company argued that they were not liable to pay compensation as the vehicle was being used commercially and not as a private car, and the accident was not reported as a motor accident. However, the court found that the insurance policy covered the use of the vehicle for any purpose other than hire or reward, and the deceased had a valid driving license. Therefore, the insurance company was liable to pay compensation.

In the third case, the court order states that the insurance company is obligated to cover the risk of all persons boarded on the insured vehicle as per the policy schedule, and that the deceased driver had a valid driving license at the time of the accident. The court cites various cases to support its decision and emphasizes that pleadings must be supported by evidence. The policy in question is a package policy, not an "Act Policy," and covers the risk of the owner to the extent of Rs.2,00,000/-, making the claimants covered under third party claims. The court also references Section 165 (1) of the Motor Vehicles Act.

Finally, in the fourth case, the court order states that the claimants are covered under third party claims according to Section 147(1)(B) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 165(1) of the same act allows for the constitution of Motor Accident Claims Tribunals for the purpose of adjudicating claims for compensation in accidents involving motor vehicles. The term "third party" is defined as anyone who is neither the insurer nor the insured in a contract of insurance. The deceased individuals in this case are considered third parties under the Motor Vehicle Act as they were not insured or the insurer of the offending vehicle and did not violate the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The appeals are dismissed, and the parties will bear their own costs.

In all of these cases, the court has emphasized the importance of evidence and the need for insurance companies to fulfill their obligations under the policy. The court has also clarified the definition of a third party under the Motor Vehicle Act and the liability of insurance companies to pay compensation to victims or their families. These court orders serve as a reminder to insurance companies to fulfill their obligations and to victims or their families to seek compensation for their losses.
