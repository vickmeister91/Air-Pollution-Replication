The court order pertains to a writ application filed by employees of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) seeking directions to declare that the BSPCB will not come under the purview of the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (EPF and MP Act, 1952) and to make payment of General Provident Fund (GPF) and pension to its retired or likely to retire employees at par with the employees of the State Government. The petitioners argued that the BSPCB was constituted under Section 4 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and was provided with the status of a body corporate with power subject to the provisions of the Act to acquire, hold and dispose of property and to contract. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a judgment.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether employees of a particular board are entitled to pension benefits under the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The board argues that it has not adopted the Bihar Pension Rules, 1950, and therefore its employees cannot claim pension benefits. The court examines the relevant section of the Act and concludes that the board cannot be excluded from the Act's purview because no scheme or rule has been framed governing the benefits of Contributory Provident Fund or Old Age Pension.

The court order states that the Board cannot be excluded from the purview of the EPF and MP Act, 1952, as it conducts research and development relating to water pollution, which is included under the schedule of employment of the Act. The resolution of the Board for its exclusion from the Act is also deemed irrelevant. The court also notes that the writ application in representative capacity by some of the employees of the Board cannot be entertained without hearing those persons who are getting pension under the Employees Pension Scheme, 1995 or who are members of the scheme. The court dismisses the writ application and there shall be no order as to costs.
