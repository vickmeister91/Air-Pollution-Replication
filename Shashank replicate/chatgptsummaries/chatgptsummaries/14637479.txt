The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which involve violations of construction laws and regulations. In the first case, Hotel Ganga House filed a petition against the State of Himachal Pradesh and others regarding a notice issued by the State Pollution Control Board. The court had previously ordered the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanctioned plans and beyond compoundable limits. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. The matter was listed for compliance and further hearing on August 8, 2017.

In the second case, a petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws. The court ordered the petitioner to demolish the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. The court also noted that several similar cases have been filed and dealt with separately. The petitioner sought to withdraw the writ petition, which was allowed subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs. The court order also mentioned that a provision of the Town and Country Planning Act had been held to be ultra vires in a separate case.

Both of these cases highlight the importance of adhering to construction laws and regulations. In the first case, the petitioner had violated the sanctioned plan and had raised construction beyond the permissible limits. The court had ordered the petitioner to demolish the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. This order serves as a warning to other builders and developers to ensure that they adhere to the sanctioned plan and do not exceed the permissible limits.

Similarly, in the second case, the petitioner had constructed a building beyond the sanctioned plan, violating municipal laws. The court had ordered the petitioner to demolish the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. This order serves as a reminder to builders and developers that they must comply with all laws and regulations, and that violations will not be tolerated.

The court's orders in both cases also highlight the importance of complying with all statutory rules and regulations. In the first case, the court had directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules and regulations. In the second case, the court had ordered the petitioner to comply with all statutory rules and regulations. These orders serve as a reminder to builders and developers that they must comply with all laws and regulations, and that violations will not be tolerated.

The court's orders in both cases also demonstrate the consequences of violating construction laws and regulations. In the first case, the petitioner was ordered to demolish the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations. In the second case, the petitioner was ordered to demolish the excess construction and comply with all statutory rules and regulations, and was also required to deposit a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs. These orders serve as a warning to builders and developers that violations will not only result in legal consequences, but also financial consequences.

Overall, the court's orders in these cases serve as a reminder to builders and developers to adhere to construction laws and regulations, and to comply with all statutory rules and regulations. Violations will not be tolerated, and will result in legal and financial consequences.
