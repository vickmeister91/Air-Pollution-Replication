The Patna High Court recently issued an oral judgment in case number 4288 of 2018, which pertains to the operation of a business without proper consent or permission from authorities under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The respondent number 5 was found to be operating a business without the necessary permissions, which led to the issuance of a closure order against the business.

The court directed respondent number 4 to take appropriate action against respondent number 5 in accordance with the law. The court also noted that the respondent number 5 had not been heard prior to the issuance of the closure order, which is a violation of natural justice. The court expected the authorities to act expeditiously in the matter without any delay, keeping in view the environmental issue.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control air pollution in India. The act provides for the establishment of central and state pollution control boards, which are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the act. The act also lays down the standards for emissions from various sources, including industries, vehicles, and domestic sources.

In this case, the respondent number 5 was found to be operating a business without the necessary permissions from the pollution control board. This is a serious violation of the act, as it can lead to the emission of harmful pollutants into the air, which can have adverse effects on human health and the environment.

The court's directive to respondent number 4 to take appropriate action against respondent number 5 is a welcome move, as it sends a strong message to other businesses that flout environmental regulations. The court's emphasis on natural justice is also noteworthy, as it underscores the importance of giving a fair hearing to all parties involved in a dispute.

The court's expectation that the authorities act expeditiously in the matter without any delay is also significant, as it highlights the urgency of addressing environmental issues. The court's focus on the environmental issue is commendable, as it shows that the judiciary is aware of the importance of protecting the environment and is willing to take action to ensure that environmental laws are enforced.

Overall, the Patna High Court's oral judgment in case number 4288 of 2018 is a positive development in the fight against air pollution in India. The court's directive to take appropriate action against businesses that flout environmental regulations, its emphasis on natural justice, and its focus on the urgency of addressing environmental issues are all steps in the right direction. It is hoped that this judgment will serve as a deterrent to other businesses that violate environmental laws and will encourage the authorities to take swift action to protect the environment.
