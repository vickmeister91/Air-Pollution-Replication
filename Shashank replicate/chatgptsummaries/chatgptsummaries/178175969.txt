The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that challenged an order from September 2016. This order stated that only the Forest Department had the authority to issue licenses to enter the Game Sanctuary under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The writ petition argued that the Tourism Department should also have the authority to issue licenses and allow entry into the sanctuary.

However, the court referred to a previous case where it was held that the Tourism Department did not have the authority to issue licenses or allow entry into the sanctuary. The court found that this previous order was still valid and applicable in the current case. Therefore, the court found no grounds to interfere with the previous order and dismissed the writ petition.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a law in India that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The act also regulates the hunting, poaching, and trade of wild animals and plants. The act establishes protected areas, such as national parks and game sanctuaries, where hunting and other activities are prohibited or restricted.

The Game Sanctuary in question is one such protected area. It is a designated area where hunting and other activities are prohibited or restricted in order to protect the wildlife and their habitats. The sanctuary is managed by the Forest Department, which is responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The writ petition that challenged the Forest Department's exclusive authority to issue licenses to enter the sanctuary was based on the argument that the Tourism Department should also have the authority to issue licenses. The Tourism Department argued that it had a role to play in promoting tourism in the sanctuary and that it should be allowed to issue licenses to tourists.

However, the court referred to a previous case where it was held that the Tourism Department did not have the authority to issue licenses or allow entry into the sanctuary. The court found that this previous order was still valid and applicable in the current case. Therefore, the court found no grounds to interfere with the previous order and dismissed the writ petition.

The court's decision to uphold the Forest Department's exclusive authority to issue licenses to enter the sanctuary is significant because it reinforces the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats. By restricting access to the sanctuary, the Forest Department can better manage and protect the wildlife and their habitats. This is essential for maintaining the ecological balance of the area and ensuring the survival of the wildlife.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertained to a writ petition that challenged the Forest Department's exclusive authority to issue licenses to enter the Game Sanctuary under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court referred to a previous case where it was held that the Tourism Department did not have the authority to issue licenses or allow entry into the sanctuary. The court found no grounds to interfere with the previous order and dismissed the writ petition. This decision reinforces the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats and ensures the survival of the wildlife in the sanctuary.
