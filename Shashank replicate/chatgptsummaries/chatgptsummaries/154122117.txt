In a recent court order, three applicants who were arrested for hunting a tiger in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, were granted bail. The court allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicants on bail upon their furnishing personal bond and surety. However, the court also listed six conditions that the applicants must comply with, including cooperating in the trial and not committing any similar offense.

The court order pertains to a bail application filed by the three applicants, who were arrested for hunting a tiger, which is a protected species under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The applicants had been in custody for some time, and their bail application was heard by the court.

After hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense, the court allowed the bail application and directed the release of the applicants on bail. The court also directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond and surety for the bail amount.

However, the court also listed six conditions that the applicants must comply with. These conditions include cooperating in the trial, not tampering with evidence, not committing any similar offense, and reporting to the investigating officer as and when required. The court also directed the applicants to surrender their passports and not leave the country without the court's permission.

The court also dismissed the bail application as not pressed for two of the applicants. It is not clear why the bail application was not pressed for these two applicants, but it is possible that they had already been granted bail or had some other legal remedy available to them.

Overall, the court order is significant as it grants bail to the three applicants who were arrested for hunting a tiger, which is a serious offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court has also imposed several conditions on the applicants, which they must comply with to avoid the cancellation of their bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is likely to be controversial, as hunting a tiger is a serious offense that carries a maximum punishment of seven years imprisonment. However, the court may have taken into account several factors, such as the applicants' past record, the strength of the evidence against them, and the possibility of flight or tampering with evidence.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to the three applicants who were arrested for hunting a tiger is significant, as it highlights the importance of protecting endangered species under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. However, the court has also imposed several conditions on the applicants, which they must comply with to avoid the cancellation of their bail. The court's decision is likely to be controversial, but it is ultimately up to the judiciary to decide on matters of law and justice.
