The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) by the petitioner, challenging the order passed by the Court of X ASJ, Gwalior. The order confirmed the decision of the Court of Judicial Magistrate Gwalior in Criminal Case No. 1345/16, which dismissed an application filed by the petitioner under Section 91 of the CrPC. The petitioner had sought to obtain the statement of Ashok Bharadwaj, which he claimed was necessary for a just and proper decision of the case.

However, it was found that the statement of Ashok Bharadwaj had not been recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC. As a result, the relief sought by the petitioner could not be granted, and the petition was dismissed.

Section 161 of the CrPC deals with the examination of witnesses by the police during an investigation. It requires that the statement of the witness be recorded in writing, signed by the witness, and then read over to them. The witness must also be given the opportunity to make any corrections or additions to the statement.

In this case, it appears that the statement of Ashok Bharadwaj was not recorded in accordance with the requirements of Section 161 of the CrPC. As a result, the court was unable to grant the relief sought by the petitioner.

The decision of the court highlights the importance of following the proper procedures and requirements set out in the CrPC. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of applications and petitions, and can ultimately impact the outcome of a case.

It is also worth noting that Section 482 of the CrPC allows the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. This means that the High Court has the power to intervene in cases where it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that justice is served.

In this case, however, it appears that the court was unable to intervene due to the fact that the statement of Ashok Bharadwaj had not been recorded in accordance with the requirements of the CrPC. As a result, the petition was dismissed.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper procedures and requirements in legal proceedings. Failure to do so can have serious consequences, and can ultimately impact the outcome of a case.
