The case of S. Rajesh vs R. Gunasekaran was brought before the court in Chennai, where the petitioner filed a Criminal Original Petition to quash an order made in Crl.M.P.No.311 of 2016 in S.T.C.No.199 of 2015 on the file of FTC-Ambattur. The complainant had lodged a private complaint against the accused, R. Gunasekaran, for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. During the course of the trial, the accused filed a petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for a direction to the complainant to produce Income Tax Returns and Bank statements. The trial court partly allowed the petition, directing the complainant to produce the bank statement. 

The petitioner contended that the accused cannot make a roving enquiry under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The court dismissed the petition as devoid of merits. The court held that the accused has the right to cross-examine the complainant and the witnesses, and to produce evidence in his defence. However, the accused cannot make a roving enquiry under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The court further held that the accused has to establish a prima facie case before seeking production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. 

The court relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Ramesh Kumari vs State (NCT of Delhi) and Anr, where it was held that the accused has to establish a prima facie case before seeking production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court also relied on the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of S. Srinivasan vs State, where it was held that the accused cannot make a roving enquiry under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. 

The court observed that the accused has to establish a prima facie case before seeking production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court further observed that the accused cannot make a roving enquiry under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The court held that the trial court had rightly directed the complainant to produce the bank statement, as it was relevant to the case. 

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the petitioner, S. Rajesh, as devoid of merits. The court held that the accused has the right to cross-examine the complainant and the witnesses, and to produce evidence in his defence. However, the accused cannot make a roving enquiry under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The court further held that the accused has to establish a prima facie case before seeking production of documents under Section 91 Cr.P.C.
