The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Jagjiwan Lal, challenging the validity of an eviction order issued by the Deputy Director Estates, Jammu. The petitioner has been asked to vacate a government quarter in Jammu without being given a show cause notice or reasonable time to vacate. The petitioner claims that the order is discriminatory, arbitrary, and against the principles of natural justice. The petitioner has also made representations to the Advisor to the Governor of J&K, but no order has been passed on the same. The court has heard the arguments of both parties and is yet to make a decision.

The second court order dismisses the petitioner's claim to government accommodation and orders them to vacate the premises by a certain date. The petitioner has been in unauthorized occupation of the accommodation for a long time, and the court finds that there is no possibility of change or improvement in the situation even after hearing the petitioner. The court cites the J&K Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants) Act, 1988, which requires a show cause notice to be issued before an order of eviction, but the court finds that in this case, the petitioner's unauthorized occupation is admitted and indisputable, and the "useless formality theory" can be applied. The court also cites a previous judgment that found that allottees of government accommodation must vacate the premises within 30 days after they cease to hold the official status/position. The court finds no substance in the petitioner's claim of discrimination and reminds the government of its duty to implement the judgment of the Supreme Court.

The third court order states that India must implement the Supreme Court's judgment in S.D. Bandi's case and reminds the government of Jammu and Kashmir's affidavit stating their readiness to comply with further directions from the Supreme Court. The order also dismisses appeals from unauthorized occupants of government accommodation, stating that they have no indefeasible right to be heard before eviction and that the petitioner failed to show any valid reason to retain the accommodation. The court finds no merit in the writ petition and dismisses it.
