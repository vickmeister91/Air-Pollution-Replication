On October 15, 2019, the court heard a bail application from Usuf Ali, who had been arrested in connection with a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Arms Act, and Wild Life Protection Act. The court issued notice to the state and ordered the Public Prosecutor to produce the Case Diary on the next date of hearing, which was set for October 22, 2019.

The case against Usuf Ali was registered under several sections of the IPC, including Section 120B (criminal conspiracy), Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), Section 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc.), Section 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), Section 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record), and Section 506 (criminal intimidation). In addition, he was also charged under the Arms Act and the Wild Life Protection Act.

Usuf Ali had filed a bail application before the court, seeking his release on bail. His counsel argued that he had been falsely implicated in the case and that there was no evidence against him. He further submitted that Usuf Ali was a law-abiding citizen and had no criminal antecedents. The counsel also contended that Usuf Ali was suffering from various health issues and needed medical attention, which he was not receiving in custody.

The Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application and submitted that the investigation was still ongoing and that there was a possibility of Usuf Ali tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses if he was released on bail. The Public Prosecutor also argued that the charges against Usuf Ali were serious in nature and that he was not entitled to bail.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court issued notice to the state and ordered the Public Prosecutor to produce the Case Diary on the next date of hearing. The court also observed that the charges against Usuf Ali were serious in nature and that the investigation was still ongoing. However, the court did not make any decision on the bail application and adjourned the matter to October 22, 2019.

The court issued notice to the state and ordered the Public Prosecutor to produce the Case Diary on the next date of hearing, which was set for October 22, 2019.
