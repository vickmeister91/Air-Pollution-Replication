In recent years, the illegal trade of wildlife articles has become a major concern for conservationists and law enforcement agencies. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, is the primary legislation in India that governs the protection of wildlife and their habitats. The act prohibits the hunting, poaching, and trade of wildlife articles, including body parts of endangered species such as tigers.

In a recent court order, the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau filed a case against three accused individuals for their involvement in the illegal trade of tiger body parts. The accused were apprehended with tiger bones, nails, and canines, as well as a cash amount of Rs. 2,70,000. The court examined the evidence presented by the prosecution, including witness statements and seizure memos, and found the accused guilty of violating several provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court found that there was prima facie evidence of a nexus between the accused and the illegal trade of wildlife articles. The statements made by the accused were admissible in court, and the prosecution's case against accused no.3 rested on his alleged involvement in procuring and providing financial assistance for the illegal trade of wildlife articles with accused no.1 and 2.

The court ordered that charges be framed against the accused and set a date for the next hearing. The court also dismissed an application for the release of cash recovered during the investigation, finding that the accused's claim that it belongs to his wife is not credible.

In another court order, the court discussed various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and the charges against the accused in a case involving possession and dealing of banned animal trophies and articles. The court found sufficient grounds to frame charges against accused no.1 and 2 for illegal possession and dealing of wildlife articles, but no charge was made out against accused no.3 for recovery/illegal possession of wildlife animal trophies/articles.

However, the prosecution's case against accused no.3 rested on his alleged involvement in procuring and providing financial assistance for the illegal trade of wildlife articles with accused no.1 and 2. The court also considered the defense's arguments regarding the seized cash amount and property.

The court ordered the release of a cash amount of Rs. 50 lacs seized by the police to the applicant in the first court order. In the second court order, the court dismissed the application for the release of the seized cash amount, finding that the accused's claim that it belongs to his wife is not credible.

The court's orders in these cases highlight the seriousness of the illegal trade of wildlife articles and the need for strict enforcement of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court's decision to frame charges against the accused sends a strong message to those involved in the illegal trade of wildlife articles that such activities will not be tolerated.

Conservationists and law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly to combat the illegal trade of wildlife articles, but much more needs to be done. The demand for wildlife articles, particularly in Asian countries, remains high, and the profits from such activities are enormous.

The court's orders in these cases are a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done to raise awareness about the importance of wildlife conservation and to strengthen enforcement measures to combat the illegal trade of wildlife articles.
