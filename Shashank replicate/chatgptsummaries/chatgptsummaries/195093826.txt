The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The petitioner is challenging an order passed by the Sr. Civil Judge & CJM, Haveri, dated 8/11/2012 in Criminal Case No.18/2010. The petitioner had made an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for summoning the Accountant General Bangalore and Director KGID, Bangalore, to produce the service register and insurance policy of the father of the complainant. However, the application was dismissed by the learned Judge.

The petitioner argued that the dismissal of the application was erroneous and that the learned Judge had failed to exercise his discretion in a judicial manner. The petitioner contended that the service register and insurance policy were crucial pieces of evidence that would help establish the innocence of the accused. The petitioner further argued that the learned Judge had not considered the relevance and importance of the evidence sought to be produced.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the learned Judge had exercised his discretionary power on the basis of the materials available. The court held that the said discretionary power has to be understood as judicial discretionary and not as personal discretionary. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference with the impugned order.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the exercise of discretionary power by a judge must be based on the materials available and must be judicial in nature. The court cannot interfere with the exercise of such discretion unless it is shown that the judge has acted arbitrarily or capriciously or has failed to exercise his discretion in a judicial manner.

In this case, the court found that the learned Judge had exercised his discretion in a judicial manner and had considered the materials available before dismissing the petitioner's application. The court also found that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference with the impugned order.

The court's decision highlights the importance of the exercise of discretionary power by judges in a judicial manner. It also emphasizes the need for parties to make out a strong case for interference with such exercise of discretion. The court's decision is a reminder to litigants that the exercise of discretionary power by judges is not absolute and can be challenged if it is shown to be arbitrary or capricious.
