The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where the plaintiff is seeking to recover maintenance charges from the defendant. In the first case, Sh. Rakesh Aggarwal filed a suit against Mr. Sudhir Kr. Mittal for the recovery of Rs. 23,799/- as maintenance charges for a flat purchased by Mr. Mittal from M/s Vishal Properties Pvt. Ltd. The plaintiff was appointed by the builder to maintain the building and was authorized to recover maintenance charges from the defendant. However, the defendant denied any privity of contract with the plaintiff and refused to pay the maintenance charges. The court framed six issues and reserved judgment on 29.01.2011, which was pronounced on 31.01.2011.

In the second case, the court addressed two issues - whether it had territorial jurisdiction to try the case and whether there existed privity of contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff on both issues, stating that the defendant did pay maintenance charges to the plaintiff and that the defendant was liable to pay compensation for the services rendered.

In the third case, the plaintiff provided maintenance services to the defendant's flat and sued for payment. The court found that under Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act, the defendant was liable to pay compensation for the services rendered, even if there was no formal contract. The court also found that an agreement between the parties was binding on the defendant and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the maintenance amount and interest at 9% per annum. A decree was passed in favor of the plaintiff for Rs. 23,799/- along with interest and costs.

In all three cases, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay the maintenance charges owed. The court also emphasized the importance of privity of contract and the binding nature of agreements between parties. The court's decisions were based on the Indian Contract Act and its provisions regarding compensation for services rendered. 

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and the consequences of failing to do so. They also emphasize the need for clear communication and agreements between parties to avoid disputes and legal action.
