In a recent case, the petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash a notice that had been issued to him to appear and produce documents in a criminal case. However, the notice was subsequently replaced by another notice, which made the petition irrelevant. As a result, the petition was dismissed as infructuous.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner had invoked this section to seek the quashing of a notice that had been issued to him in a criminal case.

The notice had required the petitioner to appear before the court and produce certain documents that were relevant to the case. However, before the petitioner could comply with the notice, it was replaced by another notice that made the first notice irrelevant. The second notice did not require the petitioner to produce any documents, and as a result, the petition that had been filed by the petitioner became infructuous.

When a petition becomes infructuous, it means that the relief sought by the petitioner is no longer relevant or necessary. In this case, since the notice that had been the subject of the petition had been replaced by another notice, the petition was no longer necessary. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition as infructuous.

The dismissal of the petition as infructuous means that the court did not make any substantive ruling on the merits of the case. Instead, the court simply noted that the relief sought by the petitioner was no longer relevant or necessary, and therefore, the petition could not be entertained.

In conclusion, the petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash a notice that had been issued to him to appear and produce documents in a criminal case. However, the notice was subsequently replaced by another notice, which made the petition irrelevant. As a result, the petition was dismissed as infructuous. The dismissal of the petition as infructuous means that the court did not make any substantive ruling on the merits of the case.
