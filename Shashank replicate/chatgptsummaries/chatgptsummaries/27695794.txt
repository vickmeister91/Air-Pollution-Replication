The court order pertains to a criminal revision filed by Zulfikar Ali challenging the orders of the trial court for the release of a cow elephant, which was seized from him under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The revisionist was convicted for having committed an offense under the Act and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 20,000/- along with imprisonment till the rising of the Court. The court dismissed the revision petition on the grounds that the elephant was the property of the State and the application was not maintainable. The court also noted that the stand taken by the revisionist in the revision petition was completely different from the stand taken by him during the trial.

The court order states that the Revisionist's claim in the Revision Petition is different from his stand during the trial regarding the custody of an elephant. The elephant is considered the property of the state under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Revisionist's claim to custody based on a letter of authority is deemed a sham, and the court cannot grant custody based on it. The court also notes that no application was made on behalf of the supposed owner until after the trial court had already made a decision on the case property.

The court order discusses Section 452 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the disposal of case property after the conclusion of a trial. The court has the power to deliver the property to the rightful owner or dispose of it in other ways. The order also mentions a case involving an elephant that was seized and sent to a national park. The court states that the person claiming ownership had ample opportunity to claim the animal but did not do so, and therefore cannot do so now. The court also finds that the revision petition filed in the case is not maintainable in its present form and dismisses it.
