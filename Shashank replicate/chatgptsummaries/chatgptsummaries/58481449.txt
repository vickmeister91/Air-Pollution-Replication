The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s E. Tech Projects Private Limited challenging the consent granted to M/s SMS Water Grace Enviro-protect Private Limited for establishing a Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Plant in Raipur. The petitioner argues that the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board bar the installation of a second CBWTF in the same area until the minimum bed capacity of 10,000 is achieved. The State Environment Conservation Board has filed a return stating that the guidelines are non-statutory in nature and have no statutory force. The CBWTF established by the petitioner has failed to perform its duty, and the National Green Tribunal has emphasized the need for further CBWTF in the state.

The National Green Tribunal has ordered the dismissal of a writ petition seeking to establish a further CBWTF in the State of Chhattisgarh, as the CBWTF available at present was found to be inefficient and inadequate. The court also found that there is no bar in establishing further CBWTF in the state, and that the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board are only directory in nature and are not mandatory or enforceable through the court of law. The court also considered whether there is a specific bar contained in the rules or circulars for the establishment of a further CBWTF during the operation of one CBWTF.

The court order discusses three issues: delay and laches in the writ petition, whether proper procedure was followed in setting up and operating a CBWTF, and the legal framework governing environmental protection and waste management. The court cites provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, the Water Act, and the Air Act, as well as the Bio Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1998 and the Guidelines for Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Facility. The court notes that the Rules of 1998 do not specify the coverage area of CBWTFs, and that the Rules of 2016, which do specify a coverage area, were not in effect at the time the impugned order was granted. The court also mentions a previous Supreme Court judgment on the construction and installation of incinerators in hospitals and nursing homes.

The court order discusses the guidelines for setting up a Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility (CBWTF) and states that only one CBWTF can cater to up to 10,000 beds within a radius of 150 km. However, if there are no 10,000 beds available within the radius, another CBWTF may be allowed to cater to healthcare units outside the radius. The court also determines that the guidelines are not statutory in nature and cannot be enforced by a writ petition. The court cites previous cases to support its decision.

The court order states that compliance with directory provisions is sufficient unless it results in loss or prejudice to a party. Even violation of mandatory provisions does not always lead to interference by the court. If a mandatory provision is in the interest of the public, it cannot be waived by a party. The court should consider the economic impact of its decisions, especially in a developing economy like India. Economic interest should take precedence over technical violation of the law. The court should apply the statutory provisions but also consider the economic impact of its decisions.

The court order discusses the establishment of a CBWTF plant in Raipur and the petitioner's objection to it. The court found that the petitioner's plant was not functioning properly and had received several complaints, leading to the need for another CBWTF plant in the area. The court also cited a National Green Tribunal order that highlighted the inadequate number of CBWTFs in the state and issued directions for their proper implementation. The court ultimately found that there was no legal bar to establishing multiple CBWTFs in a particular locality and upheld the decision to grant consent for the establishment of another plant in Raipur.

The court order states that the establishment of a further CBWTF at Raipur is necessary and there is no legal bar for its establishment in the locality where the petitioner is operating the unit of CBWTF at present. The petitioner's delay of 51 months in filing the writ petition challenging the order granting consent to establish CBWTF is unacceptable and the writ petition is dismissed on the ground of delay and laches. The court also explains the procedure for setting up and operating a CBWTF as per the guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board and the Rules of 1998. The permission/consent to establish CBWTF has to be granted as per the Rules of 1998 read with the guidelines of CPCB 2003, and the prescribed procedure has to be followed while granting consent to establish.

The court order states that the permission granted by the State Pollution Control Board to establish a Common Bio-medical Waste Treatment Facility is in accordance with the law. The court rejected the argument that the permission could not have been granted without an open and transparent selection of an eligible agency. The writ petition was dismissed, and the parties were left to bear their own costs.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition challenging the consent granted to establish a Common Bio-Medical Waste Treatment Plant in Raipur. The court found that there is no legal bar to establishing multiple CBWTFs in a particular locality and upheld the decision to grant consent for the establishment of another plant in Raipur. The court also discussed the guidelines for setting up a CB
