The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed an appeal by Bhag Singh and others against the State of Punjab and others. The appellants had filed a writ petition in 1994, claiming that industries were operating in residential areas and should be closed. The High Court asked for a report from the Punjab Pollution Control Board, which showed that most units had complied with pollution control laws. The High Court disposed of the writ petition, directing that pollution norms and standards be verified periodically. 

The appellants challenged the High Court's judgment, claiming that the properties in question were now in a residential area according to the new Master Plan. The respondents argued that the new Master Plan had not yet been notified. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, stating that the effect of the new Master Plan could not be considered until it was notified. 

The case highlights the issue of industries operating in residential areas and the need for compliance with pollution control laws. The High Court's direction for periodic verification of pollution norms and standards is a step towards ensuring that industries do not harm the environment and the health of residents. 

However, the appellants' claim that the properties in question were now in a residential area according to the new Master Plan raises questions about the effectiveness of urban planning and the need for timely notification of plans. The respondents' argument that the new Master Plan had not yet been notified suggests a lack of coordination and communication between different government departments. 

The Supreme Court's dismissal of the appeal indicates that until the new Master Plan is notified, the existing laws and regulations will continue to apply. This decision reinforces the importance of timely notification of plans and the need for coordination between different government departments. 

Overall, the case highlights the importance of compliance with pollution control laws and the need for effective urban planning. It also underscores the need for coordination and communication between different government departments to ensure timely notification of plans and effective implementation of laws and regulations.
