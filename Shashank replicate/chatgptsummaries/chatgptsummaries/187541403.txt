The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies and individuals involved in the mining and marble industries. The court order lists the details of the petitioners and respondents. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department.

The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the Net Present Value (NPV) from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area.

The court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV shall not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land diversion.

The court heard arguments from the Additional Advocate General and noted that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire 281 hectares of forest land, and thus, approval was given on 07.02.2000 for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017. The court also noted that out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court ultimately found that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief by way of these writ petitions, as on one hand, the mining lease holders have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended.

The court found that the petitioners were among the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area and had sought to restrain the respondents from recovering the NPV amount from them. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed that the total common area being used by the mining lease holders in the cluster shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances.
