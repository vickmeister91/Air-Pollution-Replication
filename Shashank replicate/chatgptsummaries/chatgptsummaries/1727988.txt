The State of Orissa appealed a judgment by the Orissa High Court that directed the issuance of Timber Transit permits to displaced persons who were granted land in reserved forest areas for cultivation. The High Court overlooked statutory provisions that restrict deforestation and the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval from the Central Government. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, stating that the respondents had no right to deforest the land and cut the trees belonging to the government without permission. The High Court's order was set aside.

The case in question pertains to the issuance of Timber Transit permits to displaced persons who were granted land in reserved forest areas for cultivation. The Orissa High Court had directed the issuance of such permits, but the State of Orissa appealed the judgment, arguing that the High Court had overlooked statutory provisions that restrict deforestation and the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval from the Central Government.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling, agreed with the State of Orissa and allowed the appeal. The Court held that the respondents had no right to deforest the land and cut the trees belonging to the government without permission. The Court also set aside the High Court's order directing the issuance of Timber Transit permits.

The case highlights the importance of statutory provisions that regulate the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Supreme Court's ruling reinforces the need for prior approval from the Central Government before any deforestation or use of forest land for non-forest purposes can take place.

The case also raises questions about the rights of displaced persons who are granted land in reserved forest areas for cultivation. While such persons may have a legitimate claim to the land, they must also abide by the statutory provisions that regulate the use of forest land. The Supreme Court's ruling suggests that such persons must obtain prior approval from the Central Government before any deforestation or use of forest land for non-forest purposes can take place.

Overall, the case underscores the importance of balancing the rights of displaced persons with the need to protect forest land and the environment. While displaced persons may have a legitimate claim to land in reserved forest areas, they must also abide by the statutory provisions that regulate the use of such land. The Supreme Court's ruling in this case reinforces the need for prior approval from the Central Government before any deforestation or use of forest land for non-forest purposes can take place.
