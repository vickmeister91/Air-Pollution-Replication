The Karnataka High Court recently ruled in favor of N. Bhoomanand Manay, who was appointed as Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board in 2004. After a new government took over, they sought the resignation of all Directors and Chairmen appointed by the previous government. Manay wrote to the Chief Minister seeking clarification on whether this applied to him, but received no reply. The Secretary to the Department of Ecology and Environment took charge from Manay on July 22, 2005.

Manay filed a petition seeking a declaration that the circular dated July 22, 2005, was contrary to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and a writ of mandamus directing the respondents not to interfere with his functioning as the Chairman of the Board. The court ruled that Manay had not resigned and was not removed in accordance with the Act. The appropriate order was to direct the government not to interfere with his functioning as Chairman and to extend him all the benefits to which he was entitled.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the government had not followed the proper procedures for removing Manay from his position. According to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board can only be removed for specific reasons, such as misconduct or incapacity. The government had not provided any evidence that Manay had committed any such offenses, and therefore, the court ruled that he could not be removed from his position.

The court also noted that Manay had not resigned from his position voluntarily. The government had sought the resignation of all Directors and Chairmen appointed by the previous government, but Manay had not submitted his resignation. Therefore, the court ruled that he was still the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board and that the government had no right to interfere with his functioning.

The court's decision is significant because it upholds the importance of following proper procedures when removing public officials from their positions. It also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in government actions. The court's ruling ensures that Manay will be able to continue his work as Chairman of the Pollution Control Board without interference from the government.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's ruling in favor of N. Bhoomanand Manay is a victory for transparency and accountability in government actions. The court's decision ensures that Manay will be able to continue his work as Chairman of the Pollution Control Board without interference from the government. It also upholds the importance of following proper procedures when removing public officials from their positions.
