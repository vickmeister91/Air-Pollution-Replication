The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Johan Das Manikpuri under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Manikpuri had been in custody since June 23, 2019, on charges of allegedly possessing skin of leopard and other body parts, which is an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense, allowed the bail application and directed Manikpuri to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety of the same amount. The court also directed him to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The decision to grant bail to Manikpuri was based on several factors. The court noted that he had been in custody for over a year and that the trial was unlikely to be completed in the near future. The court also took into account the fact that Manikpuri had no prior criminal record and that he had cooperated with the investigation.

Furthermore, the court observed that the prosecution had not been able to produce any evidence linking Manikpuri to the alleged offense. The court noted that the prosecution had relied solely on the recovery of the leopard skin and other body parts from Manikpuri's possession, but had failed to establish how he had come into possession of these items.

The court also considered the fact that Manikpuri had a family to support and that his continued detention would cause undue hardship to them. The court, therefore, concluded that Manikpuri was entitled to bail and granted him the same.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions on Manikpuri's release on bail. He was directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 50,000 with one surety of the same amount. He was also directed to comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C., which require him to attend all court hearings and not to leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to the grant of bail to Johan Das Manikpuri, who had been in custody for over a year on charges of allegedly possessing skin of leopard and other body parts, which is an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court, after considering various factors, including the lack of evidence linking Manikpuri to the alleged offense, granted him bail on certain conditions.
