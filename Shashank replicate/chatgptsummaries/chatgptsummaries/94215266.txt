The Patna High Court recently disposed of a civil writ petition filed by M/s New Gopal Int. Udyog against the State of Bihar and others. The court left it open for the petitioner to pursue their remedy pending before the Member, Board of Revenue, Patna. The court noted that the petitioner had already taken recourse to an alternative remedy of appeal filed under section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which is pending before the Board of Revenue.

The case involved allegations of pollution caused by the petitioner's industrial activities. The State of Bihar had issued a show-cause notice to the petitioner, asking them to explain why their consent to operate should not be revoked. The petitioner had challenged the notice before the Board of Revenue, which had dismissed their appeal. The petitioner then filed a civil writ petition before the Patna High Court, seeking to quash the show-cause notice and the order of the Board of Revenue.

The Patna High Court observed that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to them under section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This section provides for an appeal to be filed before the Board of Revenue against any order made by the State Pollution Control Board. The court noted that the petitioner had already availed of this remedy and that their appeal was pending before the Board of Revenue.

The court further observed that the petitioner could not bypass the statutory remedy provided under section 31 of the Act and directly approach the High Court. The court cited several precedents to support this proposition. The court noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference by the High Court in the present matter.

Accordingly, the court disposed of the writ petition, leaving it open for the petitioner to pursue their remedy before the Board of Revenue. The court clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and that the Board of Revenue was free to decide the matter on its own merits.

This case highlights the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before approaching the High Court. The court has consistently held that statutory remedies must be exhausted before approaching the High Court, unless there are exceptional circumstances that warrant interference by the court. This is because the legislature has provided for a specific mechanism for redressal of grievances, and the courts should not interfere with this mechanism unless it is absolutely necessary.

In this case, the petitioner had already availed of the statutory remedy provided under section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court held that the petitioner could not bypass this remedy and directly approach the High Court. The court's decision is in line with the principles of judicial restraint and deference to the legislature's intent.

Overall, the Patna High Court's decision in this case underscores the importance of following established legal procedures and exhausting statutory remedies before approaching the High Court. This approach ensures that the courts do not become overburdened with cases that could be resolved through alternative mechanisms, and that the legislature's intent is respected.
