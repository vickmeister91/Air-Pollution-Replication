The court order in question pertains to a dispute over the allotment of land in a Reserved Forest in Assam, India. The petitioners/appellants had claimed that they were entitled to the land, but the Divisional Forest Officer had stayed the order for allotment and possession of the land. The court found that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applied to the land in question, and since there was no prior approval from the Central Government for non-forest use, the court could not grant any relief to the petitioners/appellants.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act also provides for the constitution of a National Board for Wildlife and State Boards for Wildlife to advise the Central Government and the State Governments on matters relating to the conservation of wildlife.

In the present case, the court found that the land in question was a Reserved Forest, and therefore, the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applied to it. The court noted that the Divisional Forest Officer had stayed the order for allotment and possession of the land, and therefore, the petitioners/appellants could not claim any right to the land.

However, the court ordered an enquiry to be conducted by the Chief Conservator of Forests to determine who was legally entitled to occupy any part of the Reserved Forest. The court noted that there were conflicting claims over the land, and therefore, it was necessary to determine who was legally entitled to occupy any part of the Reserved Forest. The court directed the Chief Conservator of Forests to conduct the enquiry and submit a report to the court within a period of six months.

The court also directed that the parties bear their own costs. This means that each party will have to pay for their own legal expenses and other costs incurred during the course of the proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a dispute over the allotment of land in a Reserved Forest in Assam, India. The court found that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 applied to the land in question, and since there was no prior approval from the Central Government for non-forest use, the court could not grant any relief to the petitioners/appellants. However, the court ordered an enquiry to be conducted by the Chief Conservator of Forests to determine who was legally entitled to occupy any part of the Reserved Forest. The appeal was disposed of, and the parties were ordered to bear their own costs.
