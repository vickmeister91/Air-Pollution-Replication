The court order pertains to a case where the plaintiffs were seeking compensation for the death of Sivaraman due to electric shock from a transformer installed in a rubber estate. The plaintiffs claimed that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the employees of the Kerala State Electricity Board (K.S.E.B). The defendants contended that the accident occurred due to the unauthorised operation of the switch by a third party and that the plaintiffs had failed to prove negligence on the part of the K.S.E.B. The court dismissed the suit, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately did not agree with the defendant's contention that the K.S.E.B was not liable.

The court order discusses a case where a person died due to electrocution from a transformer owned by the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The KSEB argued that the electrocution was caused by the unforeseen act of a stranger, and therefore they were not liable. However, the court ruled that the KSEB had a duty to take all safety measures to prevent such accidents, and the act of a stranger did not break the chain of causation. The court set aside the previous judgment and decreed that the KSEB pay Rs. 75,000 with interest to the victim's family.

In both cases, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) was involved in accidents that resulted in the death of individuals due to electric shock from transformers. In the first case, the plaintiffs claimed that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the KSEB employees, while in the second case, the KSEB argued that the electrocution was caused by the unforeseen act of a stranger.

In the first case, the court dismissed the suit, but the plaintiffs appealed the decision. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately did not agree with the defendant's contention that the KSEB was not liable. The court found that the KSEB had a duty to ensure the safety of the transformer and that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the KSEB employees. Therefore, the court ordered the KSEB to pay compensation to the victim's family.

In the second case, the court ruled that the KSEB had a duty to take all safety measures to prevent such accidents, and the act of a stranger did not break the chain of causation. The court set aside the previous judgment and decreed that the KSEB pay Rs. 75,000 with interest to the victim's family. The court found that the KSEB had failed to take adequate safety measures to prevent such accidents and that they were liable for the death of the victim.

These court orders highlight the importance of ensuring the safety of electrical equipment and the duty of electricity boards to take all necessary safety measures to prevent accidents. The court's decision in both cases emphasizes that the negligence of electricity board employees or the act of a third party does not absolve the electricity board of its responsibility to ensure the safety of its equipment.

The court's decision in these cases also serves as a reminder to individuals and organizations to take necessary precautions when dealing with electrical equipment. It is important to follow safety guidelines and take all necessary measures to prevent accidents that can result in injury or death.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed above highlight the importance of ensuring the safety of electrical equipment and the duty of electricity boards to take all necessary safety measures to prevent accidents. The court's decision in both cases emphasizes that the negligence of electricity board employees or the act of a third party does not absolve the electricity board of its responsibility to ensure the safety of its equipment. These cases serve as a reminder to individuals and organizations to take necessary precautions when dealing with electrical equipment to prevent accidents that can result in injury or death.
