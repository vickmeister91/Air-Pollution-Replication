The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the petitioner, Hasti, was charged under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The charges against the petitioner are serious, and if convicted, the petitioner could face imprisonment and fines. However, the court has granted bail to the petitioner on the grounds that the petitioner's case was similar to that of co-accused who had already been granted bail.

Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested and charged with a crime to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the person will appear in court on all subsequent dates of hearing and will not engage in any criminal activity while on bail.

In this case, the court has directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court. This means that the petitioner will have to provide a sum of Rs. 50,000 as a guarantee that he will appear in court on all subsequent dates of hearing. In addition, the petitioner will have to provide two sureties, each of whom will have to provide a sum of Rs. 25,000 as a guarantee that the petitioner will appear in court on all subsequent dates of hearing.

The court has also directed the petitioner to appear before the court on all subsequent dates of hearing. This means that the petitioner will have to attend all court hearings and will not be allowed to miss any hearing without a valid reason. Failure to appear in court on any subsequent date of hearing could result in the cancellation of the petitioner's bail and his arrest.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to the petitioner, Hasti, who was charged under various sections of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The bail was granted on the grounds that the petitioner's case was similar to that of co-accused who had already been granted bail. The petitioner was directed to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each to the satisfaction of the trial court. The petitioner was also required to appear before the court on all subsequent dates of hearing. It is important to note that bail is not a guarantee of innocence, and the petitioner will still have to face trial and prove his innocence in court.
