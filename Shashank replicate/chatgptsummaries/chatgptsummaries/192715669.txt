The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Thulsidharan Pillai and others against the State of Kerala and several other respondents. The petitioners alleged that cement godowns operated by respondents 8 to 11 in Uliyakovil, Kollam District were causing health hazards due to the lack of dust extraction systems or pollution abatement measures. The petitioners sought various reliefs, including setting aside licenses and permissions issued to the respondents, mandamus orders against the respondents and statutory authorities, and inspections of the godown premises. The Pollution Control Board filed three reports in response to the allegations. The court heard the case on January 9, 2020, and delivered a judgment.

The court received two reports from the Environmental Engineer of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board regarding a complaint against cement godowns. The first report stated that the godowns were operating with valid consents and had provided necessary pollution control measures. The second report stated that an inspection was conducted and the vehicles carrying cement were seen properly covered, but the concentration of PM10 exceeded the permissible limit for respondents 9 and 10. The sound level was within permissible limits and the operation time and solid waste management were as per the consent conditions.

The court order states that the pollution levels and sound levels of respondents 8 to 10 are within permissible limits, but they were directed to provide enclosures for loading and unloading cement to prevent dust pollution. An additional report was filed by the environmental engineer stating that air monitoring was conducted and the loading and unloading of cement was carried out inside enclosed areas with dust suppression measures in place. The report includes monitoring results for PM10 and PM2.5 levels for each respondent. The loading/unloading sheds of each respondent are described, and it is noted that the garden net curtains are closed during loading/unloading to prevent dust pollution.

The court order states that the loading/unloading area of cement units must be completely closed and dust suppression must be achieved through water sprinkling. The air quality standards can be met with existing control measures, but a permanent enclosure and dust extraction system for the loading/unloading shed is necessary. The Pollution Control Board has suggested this and the respondents have consented to providing it within one month. The court directs the Pollution Control Board to conduct periodical inspections to ensure air control limits are maintained. The order includes exhibits of various documents related to the case.
