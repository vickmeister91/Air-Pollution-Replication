The issue of hoardings causing disturbance to safe traffic movement has been a matter of concern for many municipal corporations across India. In a recent case, the Indore Municipal Corporation filed a petition against the Indian Railway for not removing hoardings that were causing such disturbance. The Division Bench referred to a previous judgment in the case of Indore Hoarding Traders Association and directed the removal of all hoardings that are hazardous and causing disturbance to safe traffic movement. The Railway argued that they have the right to install hoardings over railway property, but the court held that the law of the land applies to railways as well. The court referred to previous judgments that upheld the removal of hoardings that are visible to the public and causing disturbance to safe traffic movement.

In another case, the Corporation of Bangalore and the Government of Tamil Nadu sought to regulate hoardings on railway premises and facing roads. The court upheld the decisions of the lower courts, stating that private parties erecting hoardings in railway premises are subject to regulation by state laws. The court also noted that hoardings causing disturbance to safe traffic movement are hazardous and should be removed. The order allows the corporation to remove all hoardings as soon as possible.

The court has ordered the removal of hazardous hoardings from the roadside, and the petition has been allowed. The corporation has been given permission to remove the hoardings as quickly as possible. A certified copy will be provided according to the rules.
