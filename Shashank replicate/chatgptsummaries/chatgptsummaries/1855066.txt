In a recent court case, Arvind Saraf, the petitioner, requested that a complaint against him by the Inspector of Factories be quashed. The complaint alleged breaches of the Factories Act, 1948. Saraf claimed that his factory was wrongly directed to be closed and was not operational on the day of inspection. However, the respondent stated that the factory was operational and provided an inspection report signed by the Chief Executive and Senior Officer of Saraf's company.

The court was tasked with determining whether the factory was operational on the day of inspection. Saraf argued that the factory was not operational and that the Inspector of Factories had wrongly directed it to be closed. He claimed that the Inspector had not given him an opportunity to rectify any issues before issuing the closure notice. Saraf also argued that the Inspector had not followed the proper procedures for issuing a closure notice.

The respondent, on the other hand, argued that the factory was operational on the day of inspection and that the Inspector had followed all the necessary procedures for issuing a closure notice. The respondent provided an inspection report signed by the Chief Executive and Senior Officer of Saraf's company, which stated that the factory was operational on the day of inspection.

The court found that the question of whether the factory was operational on the day of inspection was a disputed question of fact. The court noted that Saraf had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the factory was not operational. The court also noted that the inspection report provided by the respondent was signed by the Chief Executive and Senior Officer of Saraf's company, which suggested that the report was reliable.

The court ultimately dismissed Saraf's petition, finding that the question of whether the factory was operational on the day of inspection was a disputed question of fact. The court noted that it was not within its jurisdiction to determine disputed questions of fact. The court also noted that Saraf had not provided any evidence to support his claim that the factory was not operational on the day of inspection.

In conclusion, the court case involving Arvind Saraf and the Inspector of Factories centered around whether Saraf's factory was operational on the day of inspection. Saraf claimed that the factory was not operational and that the Inspector had wrongly directed it to be closed. The respondent argued that the factory was operational and provided an inspection report signed by the Chief Executive and Senior Officer of Saraf's company. The court ultimately dismissed Saraf's petition, finding that the question of whether the factory was operational on the day of inspection was a disputed question of fact.
