The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Bhola Bhunjwa challenging an order passed by the Board of Revenue affirming an order passed by the Additional Commissioner. The petitioner claimed that his father was in cultivating possession of government land and had filed an application before the Tehsildar, which was passed in his favor. However, the Collector set aside the order, and the petitioner's appeal was dismissed by the Board of Revenue. 

The court found that the land in question was recorded as forest land, and the provisions of the Indian Forest Conservation Act applied to it. The writ petition was dismissed. This decision was based on the fact that the land in question was classified as forest land, and therefore, the provisions of the Indian Forest Conservation Act applied to it. 

The Indian Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 to provide for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith. The Act defines a forest as any area that is recorded as a forest, and any area that is deemed to be a forest under any state law. The Act also provides for the appointment of officers to manage forests, the protection of wildlife, and the prevention of forest offenses. 

In this case, the court found that the land in question was recorded as forest land, and therefore, the provisions of the Indian Forest Conservation Act applied to it. The court also noted that the petitioner's claim that his father was in cultivating possession of the land was not supported by any evidence. 

The court's decision to dismiss the writ petition was based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that his father was in cultivating possession of the land. The court also noted that the Collector had set aside the order passed by the Tehsildar, and the petitioner's appeal had been dismissed by the Board of Revenue. 

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing evidence to support claims made in court. In this case, the petitioner's claim that his father was in cultivating possession of the land was not supported by any evidence, and therefore, the court was unable to rule in his favor. 

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following the provisions of the Indian Forest Conservation Act when dealing with forest land. The Act provides for the conservation of forests and the protection of wildlife, and it is important that these provisions are followed to ensure the sustainable use of forest resources.
