In a recent court order, Nathu Baiga and several others were granted bail after being in custody since July 21, 2014, for an offence punishable under Sections 2 and 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Umaria for securing their presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to protect and conserve wildlife and their habitats, prevent hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products, and regulate the possession, transport, and sale of wildlife and their products.

The offence under Sections 2 and 9 of the Act pertains to hunting or poaching of wild animals, birds, or plants, or attempting to do so, without a license or permit from the competent authority. The punishment for such an offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.

In the present case, Nathu Baiga and others were accused of hunting or poaching wild animals without a license or permit. They were arrested and had been in custody for over six years. However, they filed a bail application before the court, seeking their release on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the bail application and granted bail to Nathu Baiga and others. The court directed them to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Umaria. The court also directed them to appear before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and it is granted based on various factors such as the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused absconding or tampering with evidence, and the possibility of the accused influencing witnesses or obstructing the course of justice.

In the present case, the court considered the fact that Nathu Baiga and others had been in custody for over six years and that the trial was likely to take some time to conclude. The court also considered the fact that the offence under Sections 2 and 9 of the Wild Life Protection Act was punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. The court further considered the fact that Nathu Baiga and others had no previous criminal record and that they were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

Based on these factors, the court granted bail to Nathu Baiga and others and directed them to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Umaria. The court also directed them to appear before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to Nathu Baiga and others who were in custody since 21 July 2014 for the offence punishable under Sections 2 and 9 of Wild Life Protection Act is a significant development in the case. The court considered various factors before granting bail and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Umaria for securing their presence before the said Court on all the dates of hearing fixed in this regard during trial.
