The Noyyal River Ayacutdars Protection Association, consisting of 535 agriculturists who hold lands in downstream polluting dyeing and bleaching units, filed a writ petition against various government officials and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The association sought to quash a district bulletin and prevent revenue recovery proceedings against its members. The members of the association had suffered damages to their lands and losses in agricultural operations due to pollution caused by the polluting units. 

The court summarized the background of the case, including the establishment of a Loss of Ecology Authority to assess the damage caused by pollution and award compensation to affected individuals. The court also noted the disbursement of Rs. 25 crore to the members of the petitioner association and the deposit of Rs. 75 crore by polluting units. 

The court ultimately concluded that the members of the petitioner association were not entitled to the entire amount deposited by the polluting units and that the government's order to disburse the amount to the association was invalid. The court found that the government order directing compensation to a small group of farmers was against the spirit of previous court orders and quashed it. 

The court directed the repayment of the compensation received by the farmers and ordered the transfer of the remaining compensation to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for distribution to affected farmers. The court also directed the government to file a memo suggesting modalities for distribution of the compensation. 

The present writ petition sought to quash a revenue recovery proceeding against members of the petitioner association who were required to return the compensation received by them. However, the court dismissed the writ petition in light of a previous court order directing the repayment of the compensation. 

The case highlights the issue of pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching units in the Noyyal River and its impact on downstream agriculturists. The establishment of a Loss of Ecology Authority to assess the damage caused by pollution and award compensation to affected individuals is a positive step towards addressing the issue. 

However, the court's decision to quash the government order directing compensation to a small group of farmers and transfer the remaining compensation to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for distribution to affected farmers is a significant development. The decision ensures that compensation is distributed fairly among all affected farmers and not just a small group. 

The court's decision also highlights the importance of following the spirit of previous court orders and ensuring that compensation is distributed in a transparent and fair manner. The government's order to disburse the compensation to a small group of farmers was against the spirit of previous court orders and was rightly quashed by the court. 

Overall, the court's decision is a positive step towards addressing the issue of pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching units in the Noyyal River and ensuring that compensation is distributed fairly among all affected farmers. The decision highlights the importance of following the spirit of previous court orders and ensuring that compensation is distributed in a transparent and fair manner.
