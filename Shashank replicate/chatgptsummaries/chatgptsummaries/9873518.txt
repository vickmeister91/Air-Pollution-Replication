In a series of court orders, a petitioner seeks compensation for injuries sustained due to negligence and failure of duty of care by the respondents. The incident occurred when a signboard fell on the petitioner's head while she was attending a court case. The petitioner argues that the respondents are responsible for the accident and that the installation of the signboard was illegal. The petitioner cites building bye-laws and sections of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act to support their argument.

The court order pertains to the display of advertisements in Delhi, which requires written permission from the Commissioner and payment of taxes. The permission can be voided if the advertisement contravenes any bye-law, if there is a material change made to the advertisement without permission, if the advertisement falls or if any addition or alteration is made to the structure on which the advertisement is erected. The petitioner seeks compensation for a head injury sustained due to a hoarding falling on her. The respondents have raised the defence of "Act of God". The petitioner argues that the defence has no merit and cites a Supreme Court decision. The court will have to determine whether compensation can be awarded in this case.

The court order discusses the question of whether courts can award compensation while exercising writ jurisdiction. The court cites several cases to establish that compensation can be awarded in appropriate cases where there is negligence on the part of the respondent authority and deprivation of a fundamental right of the petitioner. The court then applies the doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitor to establish a prima facie case against the respondents in a case where a signboard fell on the petitioner and caused grievous injuries. The respondents had tried to shift the liability by claiming that the incident was an "Act of God" due to inclement weather, but the court rejected this defense as the signboard had been placed in violation of the law and the respondents had acted negligently.

The court order states that negligence is evident on the part of the respondents for not taking reasonable precautions to prevent harm to the public when replacing a sign board. The defense of "Act of God" is not available to them. The purpose of the proceeding is to determine the amount of compensation the petitioner is entitled to. The petitioner claims compensation for loss of earning, expenses of personal attendant, sufferings and injuries, medical expenses, conveyance, and litigation expenses. The court distinguishes between compensation and damages and considers both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages in determining the amount of compensation.

The court order discusses the principles and guidelines for determining compensation in cases of accidents resulting in injury or death. The objective is to restore the claimant to their position prior to the accident as far as possible. The court must assess damages objectively and exclude speculation or fancy. Compensation can be awarded under pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages, including expenses for treatment, loss of earnings, future medical expenses, pain and suffering, loss of amenities, and loss of expectation of life. The amount awarded must be fair and reasonable by accepted legal standards. The court applies these principles to award compensation to the petitioner for expenses incurred and loss suffered due to injury.

The court order discusses the compensation to be awarded to a petitioner who sustained injuries in an accident. The petitioner cannot claim compensation for loss of earnings due to her qualifications as she did not make efforts to secure employment prior to the accident. The compensation awarded should not be a source of profit and should place the claimant in the same financial position as they would have been without the accident. The petitioner's notional income for computing compensation is Rs. 15,000 per annum. The court uses the multiplier method to assess compensation for loss of future earning capacity and awards Rs. 2,40,000. The petitioner is also awarded compensation for future medical expenses based on specific medical evidence.

The court has awarded a lump sum compensation of Rs. 3,00,000 for total permanent disability and Rs. 8,71,920 for personal attendant expenses. The petitioner has also been awarded Rs. 4,00,000 for non-pecuniary damages. The total compensation awarded is Rs. 18,70,586 with an interest rate of 6% per annum. The amount is to be deposited by the respondents with UCO Bank within three months and released to the petitioner in fixed deposits over a period of eight years.

The court order requires a fixed deposit of 10% of the award amount for eight years and another fixed deposit of 10% of the award amount for nine years. The interest on these deposits will be automatically credited to the petitioner's savings account, and upon maturity, the bank will credit the maturity amount to the savings account. The petitioner can request a transfer of the savings account to any other branch for convenience. The petition is disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the court orders pertain to a petitioner seeking compensation for injuries sustained due to negligence and failure of duty of care by the respondents. The court establishes that compensation can be awarded in appropriate cases where there is negligence on the part of the respondent authority and deprivation of a fundamental right of the petitioner. The court applies the doctrine of Res Ipsa Loquitor to establish a prima facie case against the respondents and distinguishes between compensation and damages. The court uses the multiplier method to assess compensation for loss of future earning capacity and awards compensation for future medical expenses based on specific medical evidence. The court awards a lump sum compensation for total permanent disability, personal attendant expenses, and
