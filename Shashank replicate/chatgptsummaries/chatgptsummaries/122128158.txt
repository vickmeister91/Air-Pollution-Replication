The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board has been at the center of several court orders related to stone crushers in the state. In one case, a group of stone crusher owners challenged two orders passed by the Board, claiming that they had been running their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners had filed detailed replies and requested relevant documents, but the Board had refused to grant consent and directed the closure of their units. The court heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions and the violation of principles of natural justice. The court ultimately allowed the petitions and quashed the orders, remitting the matter to the Board for fresh consideration.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the powers of the State Board to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court rejects the argument that the petitioners should have appealed the Board's directions instead of seeking writ jurisdiction, as the Appellate Authority was not functioning at the time. The court also addresses the petitioners' contentions that the Board violated the principles of natural justice and their fundamental rights under the Constitution. The Board argues that it was justified in relying on earlier notices and replies from the petitioners, and that it gave cogent reasons for its decisions. The court ultimately finds that the writ petitions are maintainable and that the Board's orders are legally untenable.

In another case, the court found that the Board did not follow proper procedure when renewing the consent order for a stone crusher company, and that the notice given to the company was vague and unclear. The court also noted that the Board had not followed proper procedures when passing the impugned orders. The court ultimately found that the impugned orders were legally unsustainable and dismissed the writ petitions.

In yet another case, a stone crusher company was found to be lacking in pollution control measures. The State Board had issued a show cause notice and refused to renew the company's consent to operate. However, the court found that the notice was vague and the inspection was conducted after the notice was issued. The court also found that the Board had violated principles of natural justice and fundamental rights. The court quashed the impugned orders and directed the Board to consider the company's application for renewal of consent within four months. The court also directed the Board to inspect the sites and collect air samples to ensure pollution control measures are being implemented. The State Government was directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

Finally, the court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary, Government of Rajasthan for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of following proper procedures and principles of natural justice in matters related to pollution control and consent to operate for stone crushers. The court has also emphasized the need for the State Government to take proactive measures to declare areas as Stone Crushers Zones and ensure that pollution control measures are being implemented effectively.
