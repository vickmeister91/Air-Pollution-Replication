The case at hand involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against an order passed by the Special Judge, Sidhi in Criminal Revision No.77/2018. The petitioner was aggrieved by the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Churhat, District Sidhi, whereby the application filed under Section 457 of CrPC was dismissed.

The petitioner had filed an application under Section 457 of CrPC for "Supurdiginama" of the seized vehicle, which was rejected by the JMFC, Churhat, District Sidhi on 10.05.2018. The order of rejection was affirmed by the Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ), District Sidhi on 18.05.2018.

The petitioner approached the court seeking relief and the present petition was allowed. The vehicle No.MP 66 G 1114 was given to the petitioner on "Supurdiginama" subject to certain terms and conditions.

The concept of "Supurdiginama" refers to the handing over of possession of a seized property to a person who is entitled to it. Section 457 of CrPC deals with the procedure for the disposal of property which has been seized by the police during an investigation.

In this case, the petitioner had claimed ownership of the seized vehicle and had filed an application under Section 457 of CrPC for its release. However, the application was rejected by the JMFC, Churhat, District Sidhi and the order of rejection was affirmed by the ASJ, District Sidhi.

The petitioner then approached the court under Section 482 of CrPC, which empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to prevent abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The court allowed the petition and granted the vehicle to the petitioner on "Supurdiginama" subject to certain terms and conditions.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that the rights of individuals are protected. It also emphasizes the need for proper investigation and disposal of seized property in accordance with the law.
