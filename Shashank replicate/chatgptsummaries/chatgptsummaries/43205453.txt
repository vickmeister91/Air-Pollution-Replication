The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking the release of his tractor and trolley, which had been seized by the police in connection with an offense under Section 379 & 414 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 27, 29 & 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner claimed to be innocent and the rightful owner of the vehicle.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the court allowed the petition and directed the release of the vehicle to the petitioner on certain conditions. The court ordered that the vehicle be released to the petitioner until the criminal revision pending before the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC), Sidhi is decided. The petitioner was also directed to furnish a personal bond and not transfer, sell, alienate or create any third-party interest in the vehicle without the permission of the trial court.

Additionally, the petitioner was ordered to get the vehicle photographed, showing the registration number and chassis number of the vehicle in question. These conditions were imposed to ensure that the petitioner does not abscond or tamper with the evidence in the case.

The court's decision to release the vehicle to the petitioner was based on the fact that the petitioner had claimed to be the rightful owner of the vehicle and had provided sufficient evidence to support his claim. The court also noted that the seizure of the vehicle was not necessary for the investigation of the case and that the petitioner had cooperated with the police during the investigation.

The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the release of the vehicle was based on the need to ensure that the petitioner does not abscond or tamper with the evidence in the case. The court's order to get the vehicle photographed was also aimed at ensuring that the vehicle is not replaced or tampered with in any way.

In conclusion, the court allowed the petition filed by the petitioner and directed the release of his tractor and trolley on certain conditions. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had claimed to be the rightful owner of the vehicle and had provided sufficient evidence to support his claim. The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the release of the vehicle was aimed at ensuring that the petitioner does not abscond or tamper with the evidence in the case.
