The Gujarat High Court recently issued a judgment in a Public Interest Litigation case filed by Kheti Vikas Seva Trust against the State of Gujarat and five other respondents. The case concerns the construction of a power generation station, port, and SEZ in an area where members of the petitioner association have agricultural lands. The petitioner alleges that the respondents violated environmental laws and caused serious environmental issues. The petitioner also raised the issue of profiteering by one of the respondents who purchased land from various government authorities at a throwaway price and sold it to various industries for a huge profit.

The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a judgment. The court order pertains to a case where a power company violated environmental laws and caused hardship to local villagers in Mundra Taluka, District Kutchchh. The area affected by the company's project included villages known for their fertile land and rare species of Indian Dates. The farmers in the area were earning a substantial part of their income from the production of Indian Dates and other crops. The establishment of the power project caused a sharp decline in the production of agricultural produce, including fruit-bearing trees and crops. The court order mentions that serious ecological issues have arisen due to the violation committed by the power company, resulting in a shortfall of agricultural produce in the Taluka of Mundra.

The court order describes the petitioner's claim that two major projects, the construction of west and north ports and the activities of respondent No.5, are posing serious environmental dangers. These dangers include dredging of the sea, cutting of mangrove trees, destroying mangrove forests, excavation of land, and fly ash pollution. The petitioner also claims that the destruction of sand dunes, which have religious and ecological significance, will result in ecological imbalance. The court notes that another power project, CGPL, has taken measures to protect the environment, while respondent No.5 has not.

The court order states that respondent No.5 has caused damage to the ecology and public due to illegal activities, including discharging saline water into the sea and stacking fly ash without maintaining SPM levels. The agricultural economy of the villages has been affected, and valuable fertile land has been damaged. The petitioner also expresses concern about the State Government selling land of the Date Palm Research Station to the SEZ developer and the destruction of mangrove forests in the area. The court is urged to preserve the Date Palm Research Station and direct the government not to shift it from the region suitable for trees of Date Palm.

The court order describes the damage caused to the mangrove forests in the Mundra Taluka area due to the construction and expansion activities of respondent No.4 company. The petitioner alleges that the company has destroyed the mangrove forests, which act as a natural wall against salinity and protect the main land during natural disasters like hurricanes and tsunamis. The company is also filling up natural creeks, which is likely to have a long-term impact on the ecology of the area. The court notes that the destruction of the mangrove forests has led to serious ecological imbalance in the area. The court also refers to an independent report submitted by a committee of subject experts, which confirms the systematic and deliberate destruction of natural resources by the respondent company.

The court order discusses a report submitted by a committee regarding the violation of environmental norms by a company and another entity. The report addresses issues such as destruction of mangrove forests, excavation of clay without concrete lining, and destruction of sand dunes. The petitioner also raises concerns about the company's profiteering by selling land at discriminatory rates. The court heard arguments from both parties and reserved judgment due to the environmental violations at hand.

The court order discusses the filing of affidavits by both the petitioner and respondent in a case involving a thermal power plant in Gujarat. The respondent has been granted consent to establish the plant and has received environmental clearance, but has been issued directions to prevent fugitive emissions and to carry out a study of groundwater quality. The petitioner alleges that the respondent has violated conditions and commitments, and that there is a nexus between the respondent and the pollution control board. The petitioner also raises concerns about the blocking of a local river and the allocation of reserved forest land to the respondent. The respondent denies the allegations and highlights the economic benefits of the port and SEZ.

The court order discusses the development of Mundra taluka and the employment opportunities it will create. The respondent No.4-Company has obtained necessary permissions for the construction of the port and related facilities, including environmental and CRZ clearances. The respondent No.5 is engaged in the business of electricity generation and has obtained necessary permissions from the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and Ministry of Environment and Forests. They have also installed various equipment for environmental management and are regularly monitoring the air and water quality. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board has issued directions to sprinkle water regularly on roads to prevent fugitive emission. The court has also directed the respondent No.5 to carry out a study and detailed assessment of the quality of underground water in the surrounding area of the project site.

The court order discusses the monitoring of groundwater quality in villages surrounding a port-based Special Economic Zone in Mundra taluka in Kutch East Forest Division in Gujarat. The monitoring is done by a third-party external agency, and the results are regularly submitted to the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India, granted approval to the proposal subject to certain conditions. The court has directed
