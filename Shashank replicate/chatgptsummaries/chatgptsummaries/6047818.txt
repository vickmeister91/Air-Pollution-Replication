On July 31, 2019, the court rejected Tapas Basak's second bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Basak was arrested for his involvement in the smuggling of red crowned roof turtles, which are on the verge of extinction and only found in the ecosystem of the river Chambal. The prosecution's case was based on the disclosure statements of co-accused individuals, and Basak's previous bail application was dismissed on merit. The court cited the precedent that successive bail applications are only permissible under changed circumstances and that bail cannot be granted solely on the grounds of long incarceration. The court also noted that similarly placed co-accused individuals' bail applications were rejected.

The court's decision to reject Basak's bail application was based on several factors. Firstly, the prosecution's case was based on the disclosure statements of co-accused individuals, which provided strong evidence of Basak's involvement in the smuggling of red crowned roof turtles. Secondly, Basak's previous bail application was dismissed on merit, indicating that there was no change in circumstances that would warrant a second bail application. Thirdly, the court noted that bail cannot be granted solely on the grounds of long incarceration, as this is not a valid reason for granting bail.

The court's decision was also influenced by the fact that similarly placed co-accused individuals' bail applications were rejected. This indicates that the court is taking a consistent approach to bail applications in this case, and is not granting bail to individuals who are accused of similar crimes.

It is important to note that the court order was digitally signed by Anurag Soni on July 31, 2019 at 7:05 PM. However, the content of the court order is not provided, so it is unclear what specific factors the court considered in rejecting Basak's bail application.

Overall, the court's decision to reject Basak's second bail application under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. was based on several factors, including the strength of the prosecution's case, the lack of changed circumstances, and the court's consistent approach to bail applications in this case. While the specific details of the court's decision are not provided, it is clear that the court took a careful and considered approach to this matter.
