The Karnataka High Court recently heard a petition challenging the appointment of Dr. K.V. Bangeri as Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB). The petitioners argued that Dr. Bangeri did not qualify for the position under Section 4(2) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, as he did not possess special knowledge or experience in administering institutions dealing with environmental matters. Alternatively, they argued that Dr. Bangeri was disqualified under Section 6(f) of the Act as he was the proprietor of a consultancy firm providing services in environmental engineering to private organizations and was on the panel of approved consultants of the State Pollution Control Board.

However, the court rejected both arguments and upheld Dr. Bangeri's appointment. The court order stated that discretion given to public authorities must be used in good faith for the public good, and any clear departure from the intended purpose of a statute is just as objectionable as fraud or corruption. The court allowed the petition in part, requiring the State Government to make a final decision on recommendations made by an Expert Committee within three months, while the interim appointment of the Chairman of the Pollution Control Board will continue during this time. The petitioners were entitled to costs assessed at Rs. 2,000/- only.

The court order pertains to the selection process for the Chairman of the KSPCB. An expert committee was formed to prepare a panel of five candidates for the post, from which the Chief Minister would select two names. The committee was to consider the technical qualifications, professional competence, and field experience of the candidates, as well as their contributions to environmental science and pollution control. The selection process was to be completed within 60 days. However, despite the committee recommending three names, the Chief Minister appointed Dr. K.V. Bangeri as Chairman for a period of three years, without any justification. The court found this appointment to be arbitrary and illegal, as the committee's recommendations were not considered, and there were no valid grounds for rejecting them.

The court order highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that public authorities use their discretion in good faith for the public good. The appointment of the Chairman of the KSPCB is a crucial position, and it is essential that the person appointed has the necessary qualifications and experience to carry out the responsibilities of the role effectively. The court's decision to require the State Government to make a final decision on the recommendations made by the Expert Committee within three months is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the selection process is fair and transparent.

The court's rejection of the petitioners' arguments that Dr. Bangeri did not qualify for the position under Section 4(2) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and that he was disqualified under Section 6(f) of the Act, highlights the need for clarity in the selection criteria for such positions. It is essential that the criteria for selecting candidates for such positions are clearly defined and that the selection process is transparent and fair.

In conclusion, the court's decision to uphold Dr. Bangeri's appointment as Chairman of the KSPCB while requiring the State Government to make a final decision on the recommendations made by the Expert Committee within three months is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that the selection process for such positions is fair and transparent. The court's order highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that public authorities use their discretion in good faith for the public good. It is essential that the criteria for selecting candidates for such positions are clearly defined, and the selection process is transparent and fair.
