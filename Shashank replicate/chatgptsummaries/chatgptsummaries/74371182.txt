The Punjab-Haryana High Court has issued an order to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to dispose of a notice issued to a poultry farm owner within 15 days. The court has taken this step as the construction of the farm near a village was going unabated and contrary to norms. The court has directed the board to communicate the result of the notice to the petitioners. The writ petition was disposed of with these directions.

The order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by the villagers who were affected by the construction of the poultry farm. The petitioners had alleged that the construction of the farm was causing pollution and was a threat to their health and environment. They had also alleged that the construction was being carried out without obtaining the necessary permissions from the authorities.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, observed that the construction of the poultry farm was indeed going unabated and was in violation of the norms. The court also noted that the pollution caused by the farm was a matter of concern and needed to be addressed urgently.

The court, therefore, directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to issue a notice to the poultry farm owner and to dispose of the same within 15 days. The court also directed the board to communicate the result of the notice to the petitioners.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of following the norms and obtaining the necessary permissions before carrying out any construction activity. It also emphasizes the need to protect the environment and the health of the people.

The order also serves as a reminder to the authorities to be vigilant and take appropriate action against those who violate the norms and cause pollution. It is the responsibility of the authorities to ensure that the environment is protected and the health of the people is not compromised.

In conclusion, the Punjab-Haryana High Court's order to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board to dispose of a notice issued to a poultry farm owner within 15 days is a step in the right direction. It highlights the importance of following the norms and obtaining the necessary permissions before carrying out any construction activity. It also emphasizes the need to protect the environment and the health of the people. The order serves as a reminder to the authorities to be vigilant and take appropriate action against those who violate the norms and cause pollution.
