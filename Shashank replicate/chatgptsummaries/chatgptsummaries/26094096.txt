The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by A. Umar and M/s. Kari Electronics against Vathiyar Finance, represented by its managing partner, Mr. K.R. Rangasamy. The complainant had filed a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused for issuing a cheque with insufficient funds. The accused had filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for income tax returns and the book of accounts of the complainant. 

The court dismissed the petition, stating that it was filed belatedly and without proper reason. The court directed the learned Magistrate to dispose of the main case on an urgent basis. This decision was made after considering the arguments put forth by both parties and examining the relevant legal provisions.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the offence of dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account of the person who issued it, the recipient of the cheque can file a complaint against the issuer. The complaint must be filed within one month of the date on which the cheque was returned unpaid by the bank.

In this case, the complainant had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused for issuing a cheque with insufficient funds. The accused had then filed a petition under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. to call for income tax returns and the book of accounts of the complainant. Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The accused had argued that the income tax returns and book of accounts of the complainant were necessary to establish the complainant's financial position and to determine whether the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient funds or for some other reason. However, the court found that the petition was filed belatedly and without proper reason. The court noted that the accused had not provided any specific reasons for why the documents were necessary or how they would help in the case.

The court also observed that the accused had not made any efforts to obtain the documents through other means, such as by issuing a notice under Section 91(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. This provision allows a court to issue a notice to any person who is believed to be in possession of any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

Based on these observations, the court dismissed the petition and directed the learned Magistrate to dispose of the main case on an urgent basis. The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and providing valid reasons for seeking documents or other evidence in a case. It also emphasizes the need for timely resolution of cases, particularly those involving financial transactions.
