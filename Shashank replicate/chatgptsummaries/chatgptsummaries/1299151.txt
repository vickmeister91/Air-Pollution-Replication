The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking to quash a notification that removed him from his position as Chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board before the end of his term. The petitioner argued that this removal violated legal provisions and principles of natural justice, as he was not given a proper opportunity to be heard. The State of Jharkhand, on the other hand, argued that the removal was legal and that the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to show cause.

The court was tasked with determining whether the petitioner was denied the opportunity of personal hearing, which he claimed was a necessary component of the principles of natural justice. The court cited previous cases and concluded that personal hearing is not always necessary, and in this case, the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to show cause. Therefore, the court upheld the removal of the petitioner from his position.

The court order delves into the principles of natural justice and the requirement for a reasonable opportunity to be heard before an adverse order is passed. It concludes that a personal hearing is not always necessary and that as long as the person affected by the order has been given a reasonable opportunity to present their case, the decision cannot be considered a violation of natural justice.

The court applied this reasoning to the case at hand and found that the decision to remove the petitioner from his position as Chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board was not violative of natural justice as the petitioner was given a proper opportunity to represent their case. The writ petition was dismissed.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to show cause. The court noted that the petitioner was given a notice to show cause why he should not be removed from his position, and he responded to the notice. The court also noted that the petitioner was given an opportunity to make a representation before the State Government, which he did. The court found that the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to present his case and that the decision to remove him from his position was not violative of natural justice.

The court order highlights the importance of providing a reasonable opportunity to be heard before an adverse order is passed. The court notes that the principles of natural justice require that a person be given an opportunity to present their case before a decision is made that affects their rights. The court also notes that a personal hearing is not always necessary and that what is important is that the person affected by the order is given a reasonable opportunity to present their case.

In conclusion, the court order upholds the removal of the petitioner from his position as Chairman of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the petitioner was given a reasonable opportunity to show cause and that the decision to remove him from his position was not violative of natural justice. The court's decision highlights the importance of providing a reasonable opportunity to be heard before an adverse order is passed and that a personal hearing is not always necessary.
