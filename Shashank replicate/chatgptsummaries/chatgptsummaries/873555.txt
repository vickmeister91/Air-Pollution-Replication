The court order pertains to a case where the Goa Foundation had filed a writ petition objecting to the construction of a hotel on a plot of land in Nagorcem, Palolem, Taluka- Cancona, Goa. The Goa Foundation had argued that the land comes within CRZ-I and as such it is not permissible to have any construction on the same plot of land. However, the High Court dismissed the writ petition, taking into consideration the balancing task of maintaining and preserving the environment and ecology of the pristine beach with sand dunes and the development of hotels and holiday resorts for the economical development of the state.

The court order emphasizes that the protection of the environment and the development process must be balanced. The court also states that the socio-economic condition of the country cannot be ignored and that social problems must be dealt with in a way that benefits society. The court examines a case where environmental clearance was granted for a hotel complex and determines that there was no infraction of any rule or law. The court considers the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification and the Coastal Zone Management Plan of Goa to determine the appropriate categorization of the land in question. The court finds that the land falls under CRZ III Category and that the construction of the hotel complex will not disturb the sand dunes or upset the environment and ecological balance of the area.

The court order states that the construction of a resort complex will not disturb the dunes and they will remain undisturbed. The Chief Town Planner had submitted a report indicating that the contour plan given by the hotelier does not tally with the existing sand dunes. The Central Government had taken due care in obtaining reports from the authorities of the Goa Government as well as deputed its own scientists to have a spot inspection and report about the feasibility of the hotel project being cleared up. The disputed plot situate in Category CRZ III and was available for development by way of construction of hotel/beach resort in the development plan of Goa, which was duly approved by the Central Government.

The court ultimately concluded that the appropriate authority had accorded permission for construction of the hotel on the disputed site, after consideration of relevant and germane materials and the writ petitioner had failed to establish any illegality in the matter of grant of such permission. The court dismissed the writ petition filed by the Goa Foundation. The appeal fails and is dismissed, but in the circumstances, there will be no order as to costs.

In summary, the court order deals with a case where the Goa Foundation had filed a writ petition objecting to the construction of a hotel on a plot of land in Nagorcem, Palolem, Taluka- Cancona, Goa.
