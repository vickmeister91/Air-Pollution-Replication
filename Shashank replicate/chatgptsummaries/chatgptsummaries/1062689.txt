The court order pertains to a dispute over the construction of a park in Noida near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The applicants claim that the project involved the cutting down of a large number of trees and was in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act and the Environment Protection Act. They also argue that the project would harm the ecological balance of the bird sanctuary. The State of Uttar Pradesh denies these allegations and claims that the project was legal and would beautify the area.

The court provides details about the project, including the number of trees cut down and the estimated cost. The court also notes that the project was initially planned to have a lower percentage of green area but was modified to increase the soft/green area. The court order requires an increase in the soft/green area of the project from 47% to 65.28% of the total area. The revised layout plan includes planting over 7,300 trees of native species.

The applicants argue that the project is illegal and all structures should be pulled down. The court must determine whether the project area can be considered forest land, as cutting down trees for non-forest purposes is a violation of the FC Act. The State Government claims there was no forest on the project site, but the CCF and FSI reports suggest otherwise. The MoEF acknowledges the existence of a forest on the project site.

The court order discusses a dispute over whether a project site in Uttar Pradesh, India, should be considered forest land and therefore subject to the Forest (Conservation) Act. The Forest Survey of India (FSI) reported that the area had good forest/tree cover, but the Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF) for the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) stated that the area was a "deemed forest" and subject to the Act. However, the MoEF later changed its position and stated that the project site did not attract the provisions of the Act. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) ultimately found that the project site was not a forest or deemed forest and did not require approval under the Act. The court rejected arguments that the area should be considered forest land based on satellite imagery and government records.

The court order discusses the controversy surrounding the construction of a project in NOIDA, India, and whether it required prior environmental clearance. The court concludes that the project site is not forest land and therefore does not contravene section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act. The court also examines the views of different authorities and agencies on whether the project required prior environmental clearance under the EIA notification 2006. The State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and the MoEF initially stated that the project did not require clearance, but the court notes that this was based on incomplete information. Ultimately, the court orders that the project must obtain prior environmental clearance before proceeding.

The court order pertains to an application seeking prior environmental clearance for a project or activity. The projects are categorized as Category B1 or B2, with B1 projects requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment report. The Ministry of Environment and Forests will issue appropriate guidelines for categorization of projects into B1 or B2. The court order also includes a schedule listing projects or activities requiring prior environmental clearance, with conditions and threshold limits. The order discusses the specific case of a project under consideration, which falls under item 8(a) of the schedule and involves building and construction projects. The project is argued to fall under Category A due to its proximity to a protected area, and the court considers the arguments presented.

The court order discusses the categorization of a construction project and whether it falls under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification. The project is located near the Okhla Bird Sanctuary, which raises concerns about potential harm to the sanctuary. The State Government is blamed for not submitting a proposal for an "Eco-sensitive Zone" around the sanctuary. The court ultimately concludes that the project does not fall under the EIA notification and does not violate any laws, but acknowledges the potential harm to the sanctuary and suggests that the project should be made part of an extension of the sanctuary.

The court order discusses the construction of a project adjacent to the Okhla Bird Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh, India. The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) blamed the state government for not declaring an "Eco-sensitive Zone" and allowing the construction to proceed. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) also accepted that there was no legal bar against the construction in the absence of a decision/notification. However, the court notes that the absence of a statute does not preclude it from examining the project's effects on the environment. The court ordered the MoEF to study the environmental impact of the project and suggest measures for undoing any environmental degradation caused by the project. Expert bodies have given recommendations that allow the project to proceed with certain mitigation measures.

The court order states that the project can be completed with certain conditions suggested by expert bodies, and there is no need for demolition. The report suggests compensating for the loss of vegetation and reducing the area under hard surface to 25% of the total project area. An expert committee will oversee the construction of the project to ensure compliance with recommendations. The order also suggests proactive environmental measures and mitigation measures to reduce the impact on the bird sanctuary. The court emphasizes the need for better environmental impact studies and calls for greater precision and clarity in the EIA notification.
