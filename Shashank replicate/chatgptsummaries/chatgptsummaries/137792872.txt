The Rajasthan High Court recently heard a case regarding the grant of mining leases in a Scheduled Area in Rajasthan. The case involved a stay application and a writ petition filed by the petitioners, who argued that non-scheduled tribe persons could not be granted mining leases in the area. They cited the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution of India and a Supreme Court case to support their argument.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that there was no public notification restricting the grant of mining leases to non-tribal persons and that the State Government had withdrawn a policy prohibiting such grants. They also pointed out that the petitioners had previously withdrawn similar writ petitions.

The court considered various legal provisions and ultimately did not grant the stay application. The court order states that although there may have been a constitutional violation, the writ petition was filed for collateral purposes and the petitioners have no prima facie case. The challenge is to the consideration of mining leases filed before a certain date, and the delay in filing the writ petition is obvious. The court also notes that many mining leases have already been allotted and are operational, and a similar case was withdrawn by the petitioner without liberty to file afresh.

The court finds no force in the stay application and dismisses it. The court's decision is based on a careful consideration of the legal provisions and the facts of the case. The court notes that the petitioners have not made a prima facie case for the grant of a stay, and that the delay in filing the writ petition is significant. The court also takes into account the fact that many mining leases have already been granted and are operational.

The court's decision is significant because it clarifies the legal position regarding the grant of mining leases in Scheduled Areas. The court's decision is based on a careful consideration of the legal provisions and the facts of the case. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the grant of mining leases in Scheduled Areas.

Overall, the court's decision is a clear and well-reasoned judgment that takes into account the legal provisions and the facts of the case. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on future cases involving the grant of mining leases in Scheduled Areas.
