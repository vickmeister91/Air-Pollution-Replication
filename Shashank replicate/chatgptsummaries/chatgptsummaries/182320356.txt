The court order pertains to a case involving illegal mining and environmental degradation in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) submitted a report with recommendations, which the affected parties argued were made without giving them an opportunity to be heard and exceeded the committee's jurisdiction. The court briefly referred to the background of the case and the various violations that were brought to its attention. The court had previously ordered a ban on mining activity in the area and permitted limited mining activity only for NMDC. The court accepted various recommendations of the CEC and directed the CBI to examine alleged illegalities.

The court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate alleged illegalities and irregularities in mining activities in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The court required the CBI to present a status report on investigations in Andhra Pradesh and to investigate illegal mining activities by major corporate groups, including the Jindal Group and Adanis, in Karnataka. The court also directed the CEC to conduct further inquiries and submit a comprehensive report. The CEC identified several issues, including illegal export of iron ore and transfer of senior police officers to Lokayukta, Karnataka. The court recommended that the CBI investigate the alleged misuse of public office by the then Chief Minister of Karnataka and his close relatives, as well as the link between donations made by mining companies and alleged receipt of illegal minerals by JSW Steel Limited.

The court order explains the provisions of the CrPC regarding investigation and filing of reports before the court. It also discusses the powers of the trial court under Sections 311 and 391 of CrPC. The court has wide powers to ensure a fair trial and can even summon suspected persons and try them as accused in a case. The court also clarifies that the CEC is not vested with investigative powers and is only required to report on matters relating to illegal and irregular activities affecting the environment and reserved forests. The court rejects the contention that the CEC exceeded its jurisdiction and did not grant affected parties an opportunity to be heard.

The court order aims to prevent further environmental degradation and illegal mining and exports. The court rejects the argument that all matters are sub-judice before other competent courts or investigating agencies and that the court has no jurisdiction to direct investigation by the CBI. The court emphasizes the need for fair and proper investigation and the possibility that all acts and transactions may be inter-connected, requiring comprehensive investigation by a single agency. The court also cites provisions of the CrPC that allow for further investigation even after a report has been filed and charges have been framed.

The court order states that if the officer in charge of a police station obtains further evidence, they must forward it to the Magistrate with a further report in the prescribed form. Further investigation is permissible, but reinvestigation is prohibited. The law does not mandate taking prior permission from the Magistrate for further investigation. The court also directs the Central Bureau of Investigation to investigate issues specified in the CEC report and submit a report to the court within three months. The investigation should be fair, proper, and unbiased, and uninfluenced by the stature of the persons involved. Any investigation being conducted by any agency other than the CBI shall not progress any further, except with the leave of the court.

The court order states that any pending orders, inquiries, or investigations will not be affected by this order. The rights and contentions of all parties involved in the case are also not affected. All pleas raised on merits are kept open. The government of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and all other government departments are directed to cooperate with the CBI and provide necessary information. The court accepts the recommendation of the CEC and the matter is set to be considered on August 3, 2012.
