In the first case, the petitioner had been enrolled in the Sikh Regiment of the Indian Army but was discharged under Rule 13 (3) Item (iii) (v) of the Army Rules 1954 for tampering with his caste certificate. The petitioner sought to quash a letter with respect to his discharge from service. The Armed Forces Tribunal dismissed his petition, and the petitioner sought to quash this order.

The court found that the certificate submitted by the petitioner had been tampered with and that the principles of natural justice could be waived in cases of admitted and undisputed facts. The court held that the petitioner had tampered with his caste certificate, which was a serious offense. The court also held that the principles of natural justice could be waived in cases where the facts were admitted and undisputed. Therefore, the court upheld the order of the Armed Forces Tribunal dismissing the petitioner's petition.

In the second case, an employee failed to join his duty at a university despite receiving multiple telegrams extending his joining time. The university deemed that he had vacated his post, and the employee filed a writ petition seeking relief. The High Court dismissed the petition, but the Division Bench allowed it and ordered the university to consider the matter afresh.

The Supreme Court observed that there was a violation of principles of natural justice as no notice under the relevant rules had been given. However, the court held that the employee had already been informed that no further extension would be given and his conduct did not justify any relief. The court also cited previous judgments to support its decision. Ultimately, the court dismissed the writ petition.

The court held that the employee had been given multiple opportunities to join his duty, and the university had extended his joining time through telegrams. However, the employee failed to join his duty despite these opportunities. The court held that the employee's conduct did not justify any relief, and therefore, the writ petition was dismissed.

In both cases, the court considered the principles of natural justice. In the first case, the court held that the principles of natural justice could be waived in cases of admitted and undisputed facts. In the second case, the court held that there was a violation of principles of natural justice as no notice under the relevant rules had been given. However, the court also considered the conduct of the petitioner/employee and held that relief could not be granted in light of their actions.

Overall, these cases highlight the importance of following the principles of natural justice in legal proceedings. While the court may waive these principles in certain cases, it is important to ensure that all parties are given a fair opportunity to present their case. Additionally, the court may consider the conduct of the parties when determining whether relief should be granted.
