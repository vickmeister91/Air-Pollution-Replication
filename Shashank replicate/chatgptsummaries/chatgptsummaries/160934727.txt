The Kerala High Court recently heard a case (WP(C).No. 18558 of 2016 (T)) brought by M/S. Sree Sakthi Paper Mills Ltd against the State of Kerala, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board, and other parties. The case pertains to an order passed by the Pollution Control Board to close down the industrial unit due to certain infirmities in its functioning. The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed various exhibits, including notices, letters, and invoices. 

During the hearing, one of the objections raised was regarding the maintainability of the writ petition as an alternate remedy was available under Section 33B(c) of the Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The court noted various annexures and copies of letters, notices, and reports submitted by both parties. After considering all the arguments and exhibits, the court issued an order on June 21, 2016. However, the details of the order are not provided in the text.

In another case, the court order pertains to a petitioner challenging an order issued by the Pollution Control Board. The court stated that since an alternate remedy was available to the petitioner to challenge the order, the court would not interfere at this stage of the proceedings. The petitioner was granted two weeks to approach the National Green Tribunal and seek necessary direction. The writ petition was disposed of accordingly.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of following due process and utilizing alternate remedies available under the law. The court recognized that the Pollution Control Board has the authority to issue orders to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. However, it also acknowledged the right of the affected parties to challenge these orders through appropriate legal channels.

Overall, the court's orders demonstrate the need for a balanced approach to environmental regulation that takes into account the interests of all stakeholders. While it is important to enforce environmental laws and regulations, it is equally important to ensure that the affected parties have access to legal remedies and due process. By upholding these principles, the court is helping to promote a more sustainable and equitable approach to environmental governance in Kerala.
