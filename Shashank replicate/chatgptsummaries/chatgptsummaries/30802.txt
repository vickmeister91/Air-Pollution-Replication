The court order in question concerns a dispute between two parties, Balikanta Doss and Ram Tahal Dos, over a piece of land that was leased to them. The plaintiff, Balikanta Doss, had sued for partition, claiming that the land should be divided between the two parties. However, the defendant, Ram Tahal Dos, argued that the land held by him was distinctively demarcated and formed a separate holding.

The case was first heard by the Munsif, who found that the two holdings were indeed separate. However, the District Judge disagreed and held that a decree should have been granted. The case was then brought before the court, which ultimately dismissed the plaintiff's suit with costs in all the courts.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the holdings of the parties were not undivided shares of parcels of land, and that they themselves were not co-owners. As such, the rulings cited by the District Judge had no application to this case.

The dispute between Balikanta Doss and Ram Tahal Dos highlights the importance of clear demarcation and ownership of land. In this case, the court found that the two parties did not have equal ownership of the land, and therefore a partition was not necessary.

It is important for individuals and businesses to have a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities when it comes to land ownership. Disputes over land can be costly and time-consuming, and it is often in the best interest of all parties involved to seek legal guidance and resolve the issue in a timely and efficient manner.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Balikanta Doss and Ram Tahal Dos serves as a reminder of the importance of clear demarcation and ownership of land. While disputes over land can be complex and challenging, seeking legal guidance and working towards a resolution can help to minimize the impact on all parties involved.
