The Delhi District Court recently heard a case where the plaintiff, Dargah Panch Peer, sought recovery of possession of land that was allegedly illegally allotted to the defendant, Civil Services Officers Institute (CSOI), by the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment. The plaintiff also sought damages for the destruction of property on the land. The defendant sought to dismiss the case, claiming to be the true owner of the land. The plaintiff filed an application to restrain the defendant from cutting down trees on the land, which the defendant opposed. The court considered the arguments of both parties.

The defendant claimed that the plaintiff had concealed material facts and had not approached the court with clean hands, and therefore was not entitled to any equity. The defendant had obtained necessary permissions to cut down trees on their land and denied cutting down any trees in the disputed property. The plaintiff claimed that the property was a wakf for religious purposes and had been wrongfully dispossessed. The court had granted an interim injunction restraining the defendant from cutting down any trees, but the defendant had filed an application to vacate the stay. The plaintiff denied any suppressions and claimed that the green area was the property of the plaintiff Durgah and no trees could be cut down.

The court order stated that the Dargah Plaintiff had built the Dargah on land measuring 3 bighas, which was not liable to be interfered with or disturbed in any manner. The plaintiff had filed a suit challenging the allotment made by the defendant no. 2 in respect of 3.52 acres of land to defendant no. 6, claiming that 3 bighas 14 biswas forming part of Khasra No.43 and 44 Arakpur Bagh Mochi Tehsil Mehrauli New Delhi with Old Khasra of land No.159/4 Mauja Alipur Palangi Hassanpur Tehsil Mehrauli (Now Tehsil Kapashera) belonged to the plaintiff Dargah. The defendant no. 6 had raised objections to the ad-interim relief granted to the plaintiff on various grounds. The court had considered the submissions made by both sides and various authorities placed on record.

The court order referenced several cases and judgments, and the counsel for the plaintiff had presented their arguments and evidence. The court had made observations on the various grounds raised by the defendant and had found no merit in the objections raised regarding prior notice, court fees, and suppression of material facts. The court had also noted that any dispute on non-service of notice was a dispute of facts that could only be determined after parties had led evidence. The court had gone through the pleadings and documents and had given its prima facie observations on the case.

The court order discussed a case where the plaintiff was seeking relief from the court for the defendant's actions without prior notice or cause. The court determined that the plaintiff did not relinquish any portion of their claim in an earlier suit and that there was no bar to the subsequent suit. The order also discussed the finality of the civil judge's order and whether it operated as res judicata. The defendant argued that their actions were in accordance with the law and that the plaintiff's only remedy was under Section 14 of the Preservation of Trees Act. The court would have no jurisdiction to examine the aspect.

The court order set aside the argument that the court had no jurisdiction to examine the legality of the permission granted by the competent authority under the Preservation of Trees Act. The court found that the exemption/permission was granted after due process of law and that nothing was concealed or suppressed. The court also noted that the Act did not specifically bar the jurisdiction of the civil court and that the civil court had the jurisdiction to examine the legality of the exemption notification. The court further found that the General Manager of the CSOI had furnished incorrect information to the Dy. Conservator Forest regarding the pending litigation.

The court order denied that there was any litigation regarding the land allotted to CSOI by the Urban Development Ministry. The Preservation of Trees Act was meant to protect the environment and maintain greenery. The court was obligated to ensure that no one acted in a manner detrimental to the environment or society. The defendant provided incorrect information to obtain an exemption for felling trees. The plaintiff claimed a right over a portion of the land, but the validity of the allotment could be challenged by them as users of the land. The legality of the allotment was in question as there was no subsequent notification replacing the land in favor of the defendant.

The court order discussed a dispute over land that was taken back by defendant no. 2 from defendant no. 3, but the Delhi Development Act required a subsequent notification for such action. The land in question was categorized as a district park, intended for public use, and the allotment of the land to a select group of individuals was deemed illegal as it restricted the use of the land to a limited category of beneficiaries. The court also noted that any amendment or modification to the layout plan that violated the Master Plan or Zonal Plan was illegal.

The court order stated that the allotment of land to a recreational club by the defendant no. 2 appeared to be illegal and in violation of the Master Plan and Zonal Development Plan. The plaintiff, who claimed ownership of the land, had the right to challenge the legality of the allotment. The court also noted that the use of the land could not be restricted even
