The Himachal Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in a case involving the quashing of criminal proceedings against the managing director of Indian Magnetics Ltd., Satinder Kumar. Kumar had issued a cheque that was returned dishonoured, and the respondent launched a prosecution against him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Kumar challenged the continuation of the criminal proceedings on the grounds that the offence was committed by the company and not by him, and that the prosecution of the petitioner without the company being impleaded as an accused is bad and not sustainable.

The court held that if an offence under Section 138 of the Act is committed by the company, every person who was in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business is also liable along with the company by a legal fiction. The court also held that the prosecution proceedings against the persons-in-charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business, or the persons with whose consent or connivance of, or an act attributable to, or due to any neglect on their part, the offence had been committed, are maintainable irrespective of whether the company is prosecuted or not.

The court order also discusses the issue of conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court and which one should be followed. The court cites previous cases where it was held that the weight of the judgments should be considered based on their rationale and logic, rather than the timing of their delivery. The court also clarifies that a later decision of the Supreme Court does not necessarily overrule an earlier decision.

In this case, the court finds that the necessary averments to constitute the offence under Section 138 are present in the complaint and that a prima facie case has been made out. The court dismisses the petition and directs the parties to appear before the trial court.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the liability of persons-in-charge of and responsible to a company for the conduct of its business in cases where the company commits an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court's ruling that such persons are also liable along with the company by a legal fiction is likely to have implications for similar cases in the future.

Furthermore, the court's discussion of conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court and which one should be followed is also significant. The court's emphasis on the rationale and logic of judgments rather than their timing is likely to have implications for future cases where conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court are cited.

Overall, the court's order in this case provides important guidance on the liability of persons-in-charge of and responsible to a company for the conduct of its business in cases where the company commits an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court's discussion of conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court is also significant and provides guidance for future cases where conflicting judgments are cited.
