The issue of stray dogs has been a persistent problem in the States of Punjab, Haryana, and Union Territory of Chandigarh. Despite an earlier order and representations made by the petitioner, no steps have been taken by the respondent-authorities to control the menace. The petitioner has filed a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to take appropriate measures to tackle the rising stray dog menace. The court has issued notice of motion, and the respondents have filed their affidavits, stating the measures taken to control the menace. The court has referred to the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, which provide for the classification of dogs and their sterilization, and the obligation of local authorities in this regard. The court has also referred to news items depicting the terror created by stray dogs and the helplessness of the state governments to tackle the same.

The court order requires the establishment of a dog control cell to receive complaints about dog nuisance, bites, and rabid dogs. Specific complaints must be attended to on a priority basis, and captured dogs must be sterilized and vaccinated before being released back into the same area. Incurably ill and mortally wounded dogs may be euthanized in a humane manner, but extermination or destruction of stray dogs is not permissible. The order acknowledges the problem of stray dog menace and the need to balance it with the rights of animals. The court cites a similar case involving monkeys, stray dogs, and cattle, where the dilemma was also noted.

The court order deals with the issue of stray animals, specifically monkeys, stray dogs, and stray cattle. The court notes that while cruelty to animals must be prevented and animals must be protected, their existence cannot become a menace to humans. The court cites a previous case where the need to strike a balance between treating animals with respect and avoiding endangering human life was emphasized. The court then constitutes a committee to consider modalities for controlling the population of stray dogs through sterilization, vaccination, and tattooing, and gives certain directions to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and New Delhi Municipal Corporation for dealing with stray dogs. The court emphasizes the need for a scientific approach to reduce the population of stray dogs and for treating dogs with compassion while avoiding cruelty.

The court order requires MCD/NDMC to treat dogs with compassion and avoid cruelty. It references a similar case in Mumbai where comprehensive guidelines for dog control and management were established, including the classification of dogs as either pets or strays, the creation of a monitoring committee, and infrastructure facilities to be provided by the municipal corporation. The committee is responsible for planning and managing dog control programs, issuing instructions for catching, transportation, sheltering, sterilization, vaccination, treatment, and release of dogs, creating public awareness, and providing guidelines to pet dog owners and commercial breeders. The order also outlines rules for capturing, sterilization, immunization, and release of dogs.

The court order outlines a plan for capturing and sterilizing stray dogs in Mumbai. A register will be maintained for record-keeping, and a dog capturing squad will consist of trained employees and a representative from a dog welfare organization. Dogs will be captured using humane methods and released back into the same area after four days. The city will be divided into three zones, with different NGOs responsible for each area. No stray dogs will be killed except in cases of illness, injury, or rabies, and a panel of doctors will make the decision to euthanize. Rabid dogs will be isolated and inspected by a panel of experts, and their carcasses will be disposed of in incinerators. A public awareness campaign will also be launched.

The court order states that the disposal of carcasses or destroyed dogs should be done in incinerators provided by the NDMC at the Dog Pounds. The guidelines for controlling stray dogs should be published in local newspapers, and a public awareness campaign should be conducted. The committee should review and revise the guidelines for more effective implementation. The program should be given an undisturbed run for at least 5 years to prove its effectiveness. The court also directs the States of Punjab and Haryana as well as Union Territory of Chandigarh to make comprehensive schemes for controlling stray dogs within two months. The schemes should be formulated on the lines of the ABC Rules and the Comprehensive Guidelines for Dog Control and Management framed by the High Court of Bombay. The respondents should place the scheme before the court to signify that action has been taken.

In conclusion, the court orders aim to strike a balance between controlling the menace of stray dogs and protecting the rights of animals. The orders emphasize the need for a scientific approach to reduce the population of stray dogs and for treating dogs with compassion while avoiding cruelty. The orders also require the establishment of a dog control cell to receive complaints about dog nuisance, bites, and rabid dogs, and the creation of a monitoring committee responsible for planning and managing dog control programs. The orders also outline rules for capturing, sterilization, immunization, and release of dogs, and the disposal of carcasses or destroyed dogs in incinerators provided by the NDMC at the Dog Pounds. The court orders also direct the States of Punjab and Haryana as well as Union Territory of Chandigarh to make comprehensive schemes for controlling stray dogs within two months.
