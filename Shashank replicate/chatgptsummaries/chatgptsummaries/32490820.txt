The court orders in question deal with the concept of interlocutory orders and their limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. In the first order, Swami Ram Niwas had filed a revision against an order of the Ld. MM dated 5.7.12, which had imposed a cost of Rs. 6000 on the complainant while allowing his exemption application. The revision was filed to challenge only the order of imposition of cost. However, the court defined the term "interlocutory order" and stated that the revision cannot be filed against an interlocutory order. The court cited various cases to explain what constitutes an interlocutory order and concluded that the order of imposition of cost is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged in revision. Therefore, the revision was dismissed.

In the second court order, the court further elaborated on the definition of an interlocutory order and its limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. The court cited various cases to support the argument that an interlocutory order is one that does not finally dispose of the rights of parties and only decides a particular aspect or issue in a proceeding. The court also noted that revisional powers should only be exercised in cases of miscarriage of justice arising from a misconception of law or irregularity of procedure. The court ultimately dismissed the revision as not maintainable and ordered the revision file to be consigned to RR.

The concept of interlocutory orders is an important one in the legal system. An interlocutory order is an order that is made during the course of a legal proceeding that does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties involved. Instead, it only decides a particular aspect or issue in the proceeding. Interlocutory orders are often made to ensure that the legal process runs smoothly and efficiently. For example, an interlocutory order may be made to compel a party to produce documents or to attend a hearing.

However, the limitations of revisional jurisdiction mean that interlocutory orders cannot be challenged in revision. Revisional jurisdiction is the power of a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. This power is limited to cases of miscarriage of justice arising from a misconception of law or irregularity of procedure. This means that a higher court cannot simply review any decision made by a lower court. Instead, it can only review decisions that have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

In the first court order, Swami Ram Niwas had filed a revision against an order of the Ld. MM that had imposed a cost of Rs. 6000 on the complainant while allowing his exemption application. However, the court defined the term "interlocutory order" and concluded that the order of imposition of cost is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged in revision. The court cited various cases to support this conclusion, including the case of State of Maharashtra v. Prabhakar Pandurang Sangam. In this case, the Supreme Court had held that an order imposing costs is an interlocutory order and cannot be challenged in revision.

Similarly, in the second court order, the court further elaborated on the definition of an interlocutory order and its limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. The court cited various cases to support the argument that an interlocutory order is one that does not finally dispose of the rights of parties and only decides a particular aspect or issue in a proceeding. The court also noted that revisional powers should only be exercised in cases of miscarriage of justice arising from a misconception of law or irregularity of procedure. The court ultimately dismissed the revision as not maintainable and ordered the revision file to be consigned to RR.

In conclusion, the court orders in question highlight the importance of the concept of interlocutory orders and their limitations in terms of revisional jurisdiction. Interlocutory orders are an important part of the legal process, but they cannot be challenged in revision. Revisional jurisdiction is limited to cases of miscarriage of justice arising from a misconception of law or irregularity of procedure. These limitations ensure that the legal process runs smoothly and efficiently, while also protecting the rights of the parties involved.
