The court order pertains to a case of eviction filed by Sudershan Upadhyay against Arun Kumar under section 14(1)(a) of the Delhi Rent Control Act (DRCA). Upadhyay claimed that Kumar was his tenant and had not paid rent from May 2006 to December 2007, despite a legal demand notice. Kumar had also entered into an agreement to sell the tenanted shop to Upadhyay, but failed to comply with the terms of the contract. The court found that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties and that the agreement to sell did not terminate this relationship unless it was converted into a contract of sale.

The court order establishes that the parties have a landlord-tenant relationship, even though they have executed an agreement to sell. The rate of rent for the tenanted premises is determined to be Rs. 3000 per month, excluding electricity charges. The respondent is found to be in arrears of rent since May 2006, and the petitioner is entitled to an order of eviction under section 14(1)(a) of the DRCA. As the defence of the respondent has been struck off for non-compliance of orders, an eviction order is passed in favour of the petitioner.

The case revolves around the dispute between Sudershan Upadhyay and Arun Kumar over a tenanted shop. Upadhyay claimed that Kumar was his tenant and had not paid rent from May 2006 to December 2007, despite a legal demand notice. Kumar, on the other hand, argued that he was not a tenant but a purchaser of the shop, as he had entered into an agreement to sell with Upadhyay. The court had to determine whether there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties or whether the agreement to sell terminated this relationship.

The court found that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between the parties, as Kumar had been paying rent to Upadhyay. The agreement to sell did not terminate this relationship unless it was converted into a contract of sale. The court held that the agreement to sell was not a contract of sale, as Kumar had failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Therefore, the court concluded that Kumar was a tenant of Upadhyay.

The court also determined the rate of rent for the tenanted premises to be Rs. 3000 per month, excluding electricity charges. Kumar was found to be in arrears of rent since May 2006, and Upadhyay was entitled to an order of eviction under section 14(1)(a) of the DRCA. The court passed an eviction order in favour of Upadhyay, as Kumar's defence had been struck off for non-compliance of orders.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Sudershan Upadhyay vs Arun Kumar establishes that the parties have a landlord-tenant relationship, even though they have executed an agreement to sell. The court determined the rate of rent for the tenanted premises to be Rs. 3000 per month, excluding electricity charges. Kumar was found to be in arrears of rent since May 2006, and Upadhyay was entitled to an order of eviction under section 14(1)(a) of the DRCA. The court passed an eviction order in favour of Upadhyay, as Kumar's defence had been struck off for non-compliance of orders. This case highlights the importance of complying with the terms of a contract and the legal requirements of a tenancy agreement.
