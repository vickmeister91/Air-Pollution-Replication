The Gujarat High Court recently issued an order in the case of Gayatri Stone Supply Co. vs Regional Officer & 1. The petitioner, a stone crushing unit, had filed a writ petition against a notice issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The notice directed the petitioner to comply with certain directions related to air pollution control equipment and measures, failing which prosecution may be initiated. The petitioner had earlier applied for Consolidated Consent and Authorization (C.C.A.), which was rejected during the pendency of the writ petition.

The court allowed the petitioner to file a fresh application for C.C.A. along with requisite fee, and directed the competent authority of Gujarat Pollution Control Board to re-inspect the unit and pass appropriate order in accordance with the law. Alternatively, the petitioner could prefer an appeal against the order passed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board within two weeks.

The court observed that the petitioner had already made an application for C.C.A. and had also submitted an undertaking to comply with the directions issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. However, the application was rejected on the ground that the petitioner had not complied with the directions. The court noted that the rejection of the application was not communicated to the petitioner and the petitioner was not given an opportunity to rectify the defects.

The court further observed that the petitioner had already installed air pollution control equipment and had taken measures to control air pollution. The court directed the competent authority of Gujarat Pollution Control Board to re-inspect the unit and pass appropriate order in accordance with the law.
