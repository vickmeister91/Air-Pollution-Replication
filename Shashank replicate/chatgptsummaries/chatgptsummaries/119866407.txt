The case at hand involves a dispute over a sale deed, which the complainant, E. Pakkirisamy, sought to obtain from the accused, M. Jayanthi and Mohonakrishnan. The complainant had initiated prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which deals with dishonour of cheques. In the course of the proceedings, the complainant filed a petition seeking a direction to the accused to produce the sale deed in question.

The Metropolitan Magistrate Court No.V, Egmore, Chennai, dismissed the petition on the grounds that an accused cannot be compelled to produce a document under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The complainant then challenged the order in the High Court, which also dismissed the petition on the same grounds.

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, deals with the power of the court to issue a summons or order for the production of a document or other thing. The section provides that any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, summon or order the production of any document or other thing. However, the section also provides that no person shall be compelled to produce any document or other thing which he could not be compelled to produce in a suit in a civil court.

The High Court, in its order, relied on the provisions of Section 91 Cr.P.C. and held that an accused cannot be compelled to produce a document under the section. The court observed that the section only empowers the court to issue a summons or order for the production of a document, but it does not give the court the power to compel the accused to produce the document. The court further observed that the accused has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to incriminate himself.

The court also noted that the complainant had not made out a case for the production of the sale deed. The court observed that the complainant had not shown how the sale deed was relevant to the case or how it would help in the adjudication of the matter. The court held that the complainant had failed to establish a prima facie case for the production of the sale deed.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a Criminal Original Petition filed by E. Pakkirisamy against M. Jayanthi and Mohonakrishnan. The complainant had sought a direction to the accused to produce a sale deed in the course of proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The Metropolitan Magistrate Court No.V, Egmore, Chennai, dismissed the petition, and the complainant challenged the order in the High Court. The High Court dismissed the petition, stating that an accused cannot be compelled to produce a document under Section 91 Cr.P.C. The court also held that the complainant had failed to establish a prima facie case for the production of the sale deed.
