The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case where the Gujarat Pollution Control Board filed a complaint against Indian Chemicals Manufacturer for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The accused argued that the complaint was filed without the previous sanction of the State Board and therefore, the court cannot take cognizance except on a complaint made by the State Board or with the previous sanction of the State Board.

The court examined the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and observed that Section 41 of the Act provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence under the Act except on a complaint made by the State Board or with the previous sanction of the State Board or any officer authorized by it. However, the court also noted that Section 49 of the Act provides that the State Board may delegate any of its powers or functions under the Act to its Chairman or any other officer or authority subordinate to it.

The court further observed that the State Board had delegated its power of sanctioning prosecution under the said Act to its Chairman. Therefore, the order of sanction to prosecute given by the Chairman was not illegal or without authority, and the court can take cognizance of the complaint.

The accused had also argued that the complaint was filed after a delay of more than three years from the date of the alleged offence, and therefore, the complaint was barred by limitation. However, the court rejected this argument and observed that the limitation period for filing a complaint under the Act is three years from the date of the alleged offence, but the period of limitation does not apply to a complaint made with the previous sanction of the State Board or any officer authorized by it.

The court quashed and set aside the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate and directed the trial court to proceed with the complaint on merits and in accordance with the law.

This judgment is significant as it clarifies the power of the State Board to delegate its powers or functions under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the scope of the limitation period for filing a complaint under the Act. It also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Act and obtaining the necessary sanctions before filing a complaint.
