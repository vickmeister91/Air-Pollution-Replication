The court order pertains to multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The petitioners include companies involved in the mining and marble industries, as well as individuals. The order also lists the lawyers representing the petitioners and the respondent. The court heard all the petitions together and decided on a common judgment.

One of the petitions pertains to a demand notice for payment of Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioner, one of the 136 mining lease holders in the cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur, has filed a writ petition praying for quashing of the demand notice and seeking a direction to restrain the respondents from recovering NPV amount from the petitioner. The court has been presented with various arguments by the learned Additional Advocate General, including the fact that the mining lease holders have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire area. The court order contains details of the forest area of mining leases, cancellation/surrender/lapse of leases, the number of lease holders interested in extension of validity period of diversion, demand of NPV, amount of NPV to be deposited by interested lease holders, and balance amount of NPV of cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested leases.

The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners, quashing the demand notice and ordering the refund of the NPV amount deposited by them. The controversy involves the diversion of forest land for mining activity and the subsequent deposit of compensation charges with the Forest Department.

Another petition discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the compensation provisions do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The respondents argue that the cluster of mining leases has undergone changes since the diversion and that some lease holders are still interested in the extension of the validity period of the diversion.

The court order pertains to a cluster area of 281 hectares of forest land in Udaipur, where 136 mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for diversion of forest land. The court found that the mining lease holders did not deserve any relief as they refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court order lists multiple civil writ petitions filed by various petitioners against the State of Rajasthan and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court examined the relevant policies and circulars and ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioners, quashing the demand notice and ordering the refund of the NPV amount deposited by them. The court also directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested.
