The National Green Tribunal in Pune heard Application No. 64/2012 filed by Vajubhai Arsibhai Dodiya and others against Gujarat Pcb Ors on October 31, 2013. The case involved multiple individuals from various villages in Kodinar and Junagadh districts. The applicants alleged that a cement plant operated by Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. was being operated in contravention of environmental protection laws and had caused damage to their crops, trees, and agriculture lands. They claimed that an accident at the plant in May 2011 caused poisonous dust and powder to spread over nearby areas, destroying agricultural products. The applicants had made various representations to authorities requesting compensation and remedial measures.

The court order provided a summary of the applicants' claims and the responses of the various respondents, including the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the District Agricultural Officer. The court order discussed a dispute over compensation for damages caused by pollution from the cement plant. The applicants claimed that the plant caused damage to agricultural lands and products, and that the company did not pay appropriate compensation. They were seeking compensation, action against the company, and a survey of the affected lands. The respondent company argued that it had taken measures to control pollution and that it paid compensation to affected farmers. The court considered the evidence presented by both sides and made a decision based on the facts.

The court found that the impact of the pollution was within a specific area and that the crops of the applicants were not damaged enough to warrant compensation. The court also found that the industry had erred in not informing authorities immediately about the accident and that the pollution control board had not adequately responded to the issues raised by the applicants. The court noted that the respondents did not file a detailed response to the points raised by the applicants, and only provided a limited response defending their actions. The court found this inadequate and questioned why the GPCB did not provide a detailed response. The court also found that the GPCB's actions were not proper, scientific, or in accordance with the law.

The court directed the GPCB to take action against the concerned officer and investigate the compliance status of the industry. The court also imposed exemplary costs on the respondents for not filing adequate responses and not informing regulators about the accident and release of pollutants. The court directed the collector and district magistrate to verify compensation for affected farmers and submit a compliance report. The court ordered the direct attachment of the building constructed by the respondents and may issue further directions for legal action as per the NGT Act, 2010. The order was given by Justice V.R. Kingaonkar and Dr. Ajay A. Deshpande.

The court order also discussed a case involving Ambuja Cement Foundation and allegations of damage to crops caused by dust emissions from their plant. The order mentioned several experts and officials who submitted affidavits and reports regarding the incident. The court noted that there was no conclusive evidence of damage to crops and that the company settled claims with affected farmers. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board was criticized for not taking immediate action and for not providing sufficient information in their affidavit. The court also mentioned concerns raised by the Central Pollution Control Board regarding groundwater pollution linked to the improper storage of chemical gypsum.

In conclusion, the court order dealt with multiple cases involving a cement plant operated by Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. The cases involved allegations of damage to crops caused by dust emissions from the plant, and disputes over compensation for damages caused by pollution from the plant. The court found that the impact of the pollution was within a specific area and that the crops of the applicants were not damaged enough to warrant compensation. The court also found that the industry had erred in not informing authorities immediately about the accident and that the pollution control board had not adequately responded to the issues raised by the applicants. The court directed the GPCB to take action against the concerned officer and investigate the compliance status of the industry. The court also imposed exemplary costs on the respondents for not filing adequate responses and not informing regulators about the accident and release of pollutants. The court ordered the direct attachment of the building constructed by the respondents and may issue further directions for legal action as per the NGT Act, 2010.
