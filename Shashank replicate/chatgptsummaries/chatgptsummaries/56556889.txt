The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a criminal appeal filed by Santhosh Kumar and two others against their conviction under Sections 84, 86, and 87 of the Karnataka Forest Act. The court acquitted the accused of the charges and set aside the judgment passed by the Principal Sessions Judge, Mysore.

The case pertained to the seizure of billets by the Forest Department officials, who alleged that they were sandalwood billets. The accused were charged with the illegal possession of sandalwood and were convicted by the trial court. However, the accused challenged the conviction in the High Court, arguing that the prosecution had failed to prove that the seized billets were indeed sandalwood billets.

The High Court agreed with the accused and held that the prosecution had failed to prove that the seized billets were sandalwood billets. The court noted that the investigating officer had not produced the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka to prove that the Range Forest Officer had been notified to exercise powers under Section 62-C of the Act. This was a crucial piece of evidence that the prosecution had failed to produce, and it weakened their case significantly.

The court also observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the accused had knowledge that the seized billets were sandalwood billets. The court held that mere possession of the billets was not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused, and the prosecution had to establish that the accused had knowledge that the billets were sandalwood.

The court further noted that the prosecution had failed to establish that the accused had committed any offence under Section 87 of the Act. This section deals with the punishment for abetment of an offence under the Act. The court held that since the prosecution had failed to prove the commission of any offence under the Act, the question of abetment did not arise.

In light of these observations, the court acquitted the accused of the charges and set aside the judgment passed by the trial court. The court held that the impugned judgment was not sustained, and the accused were entitled to be acquitted of the charges.

This judgment is significant as it highlights the importance of the prosecution's burden of proof in criminal cases. The prosecution has to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and any failure to produce crucial evidence can weaken their case significantly. In this case, the prosecution's failure to produce the notification issued by the Government of Karnataka proved to be fatal to their case, and the accused were acquitted as a result.
