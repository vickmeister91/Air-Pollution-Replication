The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Devi Shankar Tiwari against the Union of India and others. Tiwari was accused of embezzlement of funds and was issued a charge sheet by the disciplinary authority. He was later compulsorily retired and ordered to pay back the embezzled amount. Tiwari filed multiple appeals and a contempt petition, but the decision was upheld. Tiwari claimed that he was not given a fair opportunity to present his case and that certain documents were not provided to him. The court found that Tiwari's claims were not substantiated and that he had embezzled the funds. The court also noted that Tiwari's version of events was inconsistent and that he had failed to provide any positive evidence to support his claims. The court dismissed the writ petition.

The court order states that the petitioner cannot rely on previous decisions that do not apply to the current case. The petitioner must demonstrate how they have been prejudiced by the non-supply of certain material, otherwise, their argument will not be sustained. The court emphasizes the importance of the doctrine of prejudice and the principles of natural justice, which supplement the law. The court also cites several previous cases to support its decision that an order passed in violation of natural justice need not be set aside unless it is shown that non-observance has caused prejudice to the person concerned. The court finds no inherent flaw in the inquiry proceedings and dismisses the writ petition.
