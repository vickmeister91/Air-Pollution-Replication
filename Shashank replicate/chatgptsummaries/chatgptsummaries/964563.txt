The Bombay High Court is currently examining whether it can issue a writ of mandamus against a private employer for breach of a private contract of employment. The petitioner is seeking a writ to quash the termination of their employment and for reinstatement with full back-wages. The court is examining previous judgments to determine whether a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private entity without a discernible statutory public duty. The court is considering whether the employer has a statutory or public duty to the employee and whether the breach of a certified standing order can be considered a breach of a statutory duty.

The court order states that the employer has consistently refused to comply with the obligation to pay wages to employees, which is mandated by the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. The court can issue a writ or direction to enforce the employees' rights to unpaid wages. The court also refers to previous judgments that establish the responsibility of principal employers to ensure payment of wages to contract laborers. The court declares a clause in the contract of employment that allows the employer to terminate the services of an employee by giving one month's notice or one month's salary in lieu of such notice to be void and unenforceable. The court allows the petitioners to work out their consequential reliefs and remedies before the appropriate forum or court. The court also refers to previous judgments that recognize the possibility of unreasonableness or lack of fairness in a contract.

The court order discusses the principle that courts will not enforce or will strike down an unfair and unreasonable contract or clause in a contract entered into with inequality of bargaining power. The court also discusses the concept of public policy and how contracts that are so unfair and unreasonable that they shock the conscience of the court are opposed to public policy and require to be adjudged void. The court applies this principle to Rule 9(i) of the Corporation's employment contract, which is found to be unconscionable and against right and reason.

The court order discusses the issue of a contract of employment that allows for simpliciter termination, which is harmful to public interest and against public policy. The court states that employees cannot be equated with goods and that a contract of employment cannot be equated with a mercantile transaction. The court also discusses the jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ of mandamus directing an employer to reemploy a terminated employee. The court concludes that a writ of mandamus can only be issued when there is a violation of a public duty or public law element involved. The court also discusses previous judgments related to the issue of mandamus against private entities and concludes that a writ of mandamus can only be issued against a company with public duties or responsibilities imposed on it by a statute.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a trust can be compelled to pay terminal benefits and arrears of salary to academic staff of an affiliated college through a writ of mandamus. The court concludes that mandamus can be issued if the duty is of a public character, even if it is not imposed by statute. The court also explains the evolution of the law relating to mandamus and the scope of Article 226 of the Constitution, which confers wide powers on High Courts to issue writs for enforcement of fundamental and non-fundamental rights. The court emphasizes that every activity of a public authority must be informed by reasons and guided by public interest, and that the distinction between public law and private law remedies has become too thin and practically obliterated.

The court order discusses the distinction between public law and private law remedies and the obligation of public authorities to act fairly and in the public interest. The court holds that a writ of mandamus can only be issued against a private entity or person if there is a public duty imposed on them and the action complained of falls within the public law realm. The court cites various judgments to support its decision and emphasizes that each case must be examined on its own facts and circumstances.

The court order states that for a person or authority to be subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, there must be a clear element of public duty in the realm of public law. The court also holds that previous judgments regarding the issuance of a writ of mandamus against a private entity were incorrect. In this particular case, the writ petition cannot be entertained as there is no public duty or public law element involved, and it only concerns a breach of a private contract of employment by a private employer. The writ petition is dismissed, and an ordinary copy of the judgment will be issued to the parties.

In summary, the court orders discussed the issue of whether a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private employer for breach of a private contract of employment. The court examined previous judgments to determine whether a writ of mandamus can be issued against a private entity without a discernible statutory public duty. The court also discussed the distinction between public law and private law remedies and the obligation of public authorities to act fairly and in the public interest. The court concluded that a writ of mandamus can only be issued against a private entity or person if there is a public duty imposed on them and the action complained of falls within the public law realm. The court dismissed the writ petition as there was no public duty or public law element involved, and it only concerned a breach of a private contract of employment by a private employer.
