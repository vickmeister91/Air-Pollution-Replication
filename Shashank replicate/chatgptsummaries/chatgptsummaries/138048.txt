The first court order pertains to a writ application filed by the Manager of "Sri Digambar Jain Bispanthi Kothi" at Madhuban in the District of Giridih. The petitioner sought to quash the order passed by respondent No. 2 in Misc. Revision Case No. 14/2000, which allowed the revision filed by respondent No. 6. The petitioner claimed that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain a second revision under the Bihar Tenants' Holding (Maintenance of Record) Act, 1973.

The court heard detailed submissions from both parties but concluded that the case could be disposed of on a short point. The court summarized the factual background of the case and the points argued by the petitioner's counsel. The petitioner's counsel argued that the rent receipts brought on record show recognition of the rayati status of the petitioner both prior to vesting and also after vesting, and that these receipts support the factum of settlement by "soda hukumnama" made by the ex-landlord. The counsel further argued that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain a second revision under the Bihar Tenants' Holding (Maintenance of Record) Act, 1973.

The court, however, rejected the petitioner's arguments and held that the Commissioner had the jurisdiction to entertain a second revision under the Bihar Tenants' Holding (Maintenance of Record) Act, 1973. The court also noted that the judgments cited by the petitioner did not create any binding precedent in this case. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order discusses a case involving a dispute over possession of land and the validity of a second revision in mutation proceedings. The court notes that the initiation of the proceeding was not in accordance with the prescribed procedure and therefore, the proceeding itself was a nullity. The court also finds that the order of the Circle Officer was without jurisdiction and therefore, of no consequence. The court rejects the petitioner's argument that the orders consistently proved their possession and holds that the Commissioner's order was passed without the authority of law.

The court also notes that the judgments cited by the petitioner do not create any binding precedent in this case. Therefore, the court declares that the Circle Officer's order was illegal and without jurisdiction, and therefore the Appellate and Revisional Orders dismissing the appeal and revision were also illegal. The Commissioner's order was within the confines of the law and correctly set aside the order of the Additional Collector. The matter is remanded to the Circle Officer to proceed afresh and de novo in accordance with the law.

The third court order declares that the Circle Officer's order was illegal and without jurisdiction, and therefore the Appellate and Revisional Orders dismissing the appeal and revision were also illegal. The Commissioner's order was within the confines of the law and correctly set aside the order of the Additional Collector. The matter is remanded to the Circle Officer to proceed afresh and de novo in accordance with the law.

The court refrains from entering into other points argued by Mr. Bacchawat as it may affect the pending LPA. The writ petition is dismissed, and the parties are directed to act as per the directions made above.

In summary, all three court orders deal with disputes over possession of land and the validity of orders passed by various authorities. The first court order deals with a writ application seeking to quash an order passed by the Commissioner, while the second and third court orders deal with the validity of orders passed by the Circle Officer and the Commissioner. In all three cases, the court found that the orders passed by the Circle Officer were without jurisdiction and therefore, of no consequence. The court also found that the Commissioner's orders were within the confines of the law and correctly set aside the orders of the Additional Collector. The matters were remanded to the Circle Officer to proceed afresh and de novo in accordance with the law.
