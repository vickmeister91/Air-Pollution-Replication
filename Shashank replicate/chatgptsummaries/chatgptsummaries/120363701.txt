The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Mala Ram against the State of Rajasthan and other officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was originally filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take measures to prevent the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and remove encroachments on the water bodies. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages.

The court directed the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal. The court also directed the state/local authorities to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000.

The court order directs the State to take steps for the construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. It also imposes a compensation of Rs. 1,000 on anyone found contaminating canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this through notices. The court requests the High Court to provide records of a related case. The State is directed to submit a comprehensive short-term and long-term scheme for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and removing encroachments. The court imposes a cost of Rs. 50,000 if the State fails to comply. The court also directs the District Collector to be present and remove all encroachments within one month. The State is directed to issue show cause notices to those causing pollution and to comply with the directions in letter and spirit.

The court order pertains to the removal of encroachments and structures that are causing contamination of the canal water meant for drinking. The state government was directed to take immediate measures for removal of such encroachments and structures. The compliance report filed by the state government was found to be inadequate, and the Chief Engineer was directed to inspect the area and remove any structures contributing to pollution. The court ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, Commissioner, Municipal Council, and Secretary of Urban Improvement Trust to provide assistance and monitor the removal of encroachments. The court also directed the state government to issue notices to persons contributing to pollution and to collect compensation of Rs. 25,000 from them. The court ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggested that persons aggrieved with the action of the respondents approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction to hear all civil cases related to environment protection.

The court order discusses the availability of statutory remedy under the Act of 2010 and how it does not bar writ jurisdiction. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances in which this principle can be deviated from. The court ultimately decides not to invoke writ jurisdiction in the case at hand and allows the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation.

The court has ordered that an appropriate application/representation be filed by December 31, 2016 in the Original Application Nos. 86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. Until then, the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s). The court believes that the NGT has the power to condone the delay and expects them to consider the delay caused by the writ petition pending before the court. After December 31, 2016, the State can proceed according to further directions/orders passed by the NGT. The stay petition has been disposed of.
