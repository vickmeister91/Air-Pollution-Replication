In a recent court order, Shaktibhan Singh and Gorebhan Singh were granted bail after being in custody since December 14, 2017, in connection with a case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court took into consideration the fact that the trial will take considerable time and that the accused have no criminal antecedents. The accused have been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Violators of the act can face imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Shaktibhan Singh and Gorebhan Singh were accused of violating the act by hunting and killing a protected species of deer. They were arrested and have been in custody since December 14, 2017.

During the bail hearing, the defense argued that the accused have no criminal antecedents and that they have been falsely implicated in the case. The defense also argued that the trial will take considerable time and that the accused should be granted bail so that they can take care of their families and businesses.

The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the accused should not be granted bail as they are flight risks and may tamper with the evidence. The prosecution also argued that the accused have committed a serious offense and should not be released on bail.

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to the accused. The court took into consideration the fact that the trial will take considerable time and that the accused have no criminal antecedents. The court also ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during the trial.

The granting of bail to the accused has sparked controversy among wildlife activists and conservationists. They argue that the accused have committed a serious offense and should not be released on bail. They also argue that the granting of bail sends a wrong message to poachers and hunters that they can get away with their crimes.

However, the defense argues that the accused have been falsely implicated in the case and that they are innocent until proven guilty. They also argue that the accused have no criminal antecedents and that they should be granted bail.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Shaktibhan Singh and Gorebhan Singh, who have been in custody since December 14, 2017, in connection with a case under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court took into consideration the fact that the trial will take considerable time and that the accused have no criminal antecedents. The accused have been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure their presence in court during the trial. The granting of bail has sparked controversy among wildlife activists and conservationists, but the defense argues that the accused have been falsely implicated in the case and that they are innocent until proven guilty.
