However, the court dismissed the petition on the ground that the documents sought were not connected with the defense taken by the petitioner.

Section 91 of Crpc empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court can only issue such a summons or order if it is satisfied that the document or thing is necessary or desirable for the purposes of the proceeding.

The court also stated that the petitioner cannot force the respondent to produce the documents. This is because the power to produce documents lies with the person who has custody or control over them.
