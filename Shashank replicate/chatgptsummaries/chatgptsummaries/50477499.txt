The High Court has recently issued an order in a case where a tractor was seized for allegedly being involved in the illegal transportation of sand. The owner of the tractor had filed a petition for its release, which was initially dismissed by the lower court. However, the High Court has now allowed the release of the tractor subject to certain conditions.

The court has directed the petitioner to furnish a bank guarantee and personal bond, and has also prohibited the use of the vehicle for any antisocial activities. Additionally, the petitioner has been instructed to get the vehicle photographed and not transfer its ownership or make any changes to it. The order has been sent to the trial court for compliance.

The case in question involves the seizure of a tractor that was allegedly being used for the illegal transportation of sand. The owner of the tractor had filed a petition for its release, which was initially dismissed by the lower court. However, the High Court has now allowed the release of the tractor subject to certain conditions.

One of the conditions imposed by the court is that the petitioner must furnish a bank guarantee and personal bond. This is a common requirement in cases where property is being released from seizure. The bank guarantee serves as a form of security for the court, ensuring that the petitioner will comply with the conditions imposed by the court. The personal bond, on the other hand, is a promise made by the petitioner to the court that they will comply with the conditions imposed.

Another condition imposed by the court is that the vehicle cannot be used for any antisocial activities. This is a standard condition that is often imposed in cases where property is being released from seizure. The purpose of this condition is to ensure that the property is not used for any illegal activities in the future.

The court has also directed the petitioner to get the vehicle photographed. This is likely to serve as evidence in case there are any disputes in the future regarding the condition of the vehicle at the time of its release. Additionally, the court has prohibited the petitioner from transferring the ownership of the vehicle or making any changes to it. This is to ensure that the vehicle remains in the same condition as it was at the time of its seizure.

The order issued by the High Court has been sent to the trial court for compliance. This means that the trial court will be responsible for ensuring that the conditions imposed by the High Court are met. If the petitioner fails to comply with any of the conditions, the trial court may take appropriate action, which could include revoking the release of the vehicle.

In conclusion, the High Court has allowed the release of a tractor that was seized for allegedly being involved in the illegal transportation of sand. The release is subject to certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee and personal bond, and not allowing the vehicle to be used for any antisocial activities. The petitioner has also been directed to get the vehicle photographed and not transfer its ownership or make any changes to it. The order has been sent to the trial court for compliance.
