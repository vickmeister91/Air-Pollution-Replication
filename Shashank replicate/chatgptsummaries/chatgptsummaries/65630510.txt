In the first court order, M/S Tirupati Buildestates Pvt Ltd filed a petition against M/S Texmaco Ltd and others seeking an injunction to prevent the respondents from creating any third-party rights or entering into any development or collaboration agreements with third parties in relation to a property in Delhi. The property in question is municipal premises No. 7395 Old Sabzi Mandi, G.T. Road, Delhi-110007, measuring approximately 21.45 acres, commonly known as Birla Mills at Kamla Nagar, Delhi. The petitioner sought the injunction until the conclusion of the Arbitral proceedings. The background of the case is related to the surrender of land by the respondent to the Delhi Development Authority for the development of "green belts and open spaces" as per the orders of the Supreme Court.

The court issued notice to the respondents and disposed of the petition. This means that the court did not grant the injunction sought by the petitioner. However, the court did not dismiss the case entirely, and the respondents will have to respond to the notice issued by the court. The court order does not provide any further details on the nature of the Arbitral proceedings or the reasons why the petitioner sought the injunction.

In the second court order, the dispute between two parties over a joint development agreement for a property is discussed. The petitioner argued that the respondent was not fulfilling their obligations under the agreement, while the respondent argued that the agreement was void because it was based on the availability of the entire property, which was not possible due to a previous court order. The court examined the documents and found that the parties had agreed to joint development of the entire property, and therefore the petitioner's request for an injunction was granted.

However, the court noted that the agreement may be void due to the previous court order, and the fundamental term of the agreement may have collapsed. The court order states that if the parties succeed in a review petition, the entire land will be available for joint development. The fundamental term of the MOU has collapsed, and respondent no.1 must refund at least 50% of Rs 6 crores deposited by the petitioner. Respondent no.1 should deposit a sum of Rs 3 crores in court for immediate payment to the petitioner.

The petitioner was aware of the proceedings in court, and the petition is rejected except for the directions that respondent no.1 must deposit Rs 3 crores in court and if they choose to deal with the property, they do so at their own risk and cost. The parties must abide by a final decision in the matter.

In summary, the two court orders pertain to disputes over property development agreements. In the first order, the petitioner sought an injunction to prevent the respondents from creating any third-party rights or entering into any development or collaboration agreements with third parties in relation to a property in Delhi. The court issued notice to the respondents and disposed of the petition. In the second order, the court granted the petitioner's request for an injunction, but noted that the agreement may be void due to a previous court order. The court ordered the respondent to refund at least 50% of the deposit made by the petitioner and deposit a sum of Rs 3 crores in court for immediate payment to the petitioner. The parties must abide by a final decision in the matter.
