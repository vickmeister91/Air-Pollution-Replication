The court order in question pertains to a writ petition that involves the quashing of an Office Memorandum issued by the Adviser to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) on February 25, 2013. The memorandum inserted Calcined Petroleum Coke plant to the list of industries requiring Environmental Clearance. The petitioner's counsel argued that the impugned action of applying the Office Memorandum becomes illegal as there is no inclusion of the item involved in the statutes itself.

The court observed that in the absence of an amendment in the statute, no inclusion of this nature of units is permissible. The court disposed of the writ petition with a direction that the Office Memorandum has no application to the case of the petitioner and directed the State Pollution Control Board to pass appropriate orders involving the petitioner-establishment within 15 days.

The case revolves around the inclusion of Calcined Petroleum Coke plant in the list of industries requiring Environmental Clearance. The petitioner's counsel argued that the inclusion of the plant in the list was illegal as there was no amendment in the statute to allow for such inclusion. The court agreed with the petitioner's counsel and observed that in the absence of an amendment in the statute, no inclusion of this nature of units is permissible.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the inclusion of industries in the list of those requiring Environmental Clearance. The court has made it clear that any such inclusion must be supported by an amendment in the statute. This will ensure that the process of granting Environmental Clearance is transparent and in accordance with the law.

The court has also directed the State Pollution Control Board to pass appropriate orders involving the petitioner-establishment within 15 days. This is a positive step towards ensuring that the petitioner-establishment is able to operate in compliance with the law.

Overall, the court order is a welcome development in the field of environmental law. It reinforces the importance of transparency and compliance with the law in the process of granting Environmental Clearance. It also provides clarity on the legal position on the inclusion of industries in the list of those requiring Environmental Clearance.
