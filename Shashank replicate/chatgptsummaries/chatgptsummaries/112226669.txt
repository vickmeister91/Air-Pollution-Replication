The Supreme Court of India has been hearing a case regarding noise pollution and its impact on the right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution. The case was filed by an engineer after a 13-year-old girl's cries for help during a rape went unheard due to loud music from nearby loudspeakers. The court examined the definition of noise and its adverse effects on health and well-being. The court also discussed the conflict between the right to freedom of speech and the right to live in an atmosphere free from noise pollution. The court ultimately directed the enforcement of existing laws to restrict the use of loudspeakers and other high-volume noise-producing systems.

The court order discusses the harmful effects of noise pollution on human health, including hearing loss, interference with communication, disturbance of sleep, annoyance, and physiological effects such as increased blood pressure and heart rate. The order identifies various sources of noise pollution, including industrial and non-industrial sources such as road traffic, aircraft, railroads, construction, industry, noise in buildings, and consumer products. The order also highlights the negative impact of fireworks on air and noise pollution, and notes that excessive use of fireworks violates citizens' fundamental rights.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by firecrackers during the Diwali festival in India. The excessive use of firecrackers has become a public hazard and a violation of citizens' fundamental rights. The court cites a case that states citizens have the right to leisure, sleep, and silence, and the noise from firecrackers prevents them from exercising these rights. The court also notes that firecrackers can cause hearing loss and contribute to air pollution. The court references other countries' legislation on noise pollution control and emphasizes the need for immediate action to address the issue.

The court order discusses various regulations and laws related to noise pollution control in different countries. It includes provisions for controlling noise levels from various sources such as motor vehicles, industrial activity, construction activity, loudspeakers, and public address systems. The order also mentions the punishment for violating the noise control rules and regulations. It highlights the need for implementing the laws effectively to control noise pollution. The order also includes some judicial opinions related to noise pollution control in India.

The court order aims to prevent noise pollution, which has been found to cause various health issues such as mental disease, hearing loss, and heart trouble. Indian judicial opinion recognizes the right to live in freedom from noise pollution as a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. The court has passed several interim orders to enforce noise pollution regulations, including restrictions on the use of fireworks and firecrackers and education about the ill effects of air and noise pollution. The court also allows parties adversely affected to make representations regarding the enforcement of fundamental rights.

The court order emphasizes the importance of enforcing fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution for citizens to live in a pollution-free environment. The court allows parties affected to make representations to their respective state governments, who may invite the attention of the Government of India if satisfied with the genuineness of the representation. The court notes the difficulty in implementing noise pollution control methodology in India due to a lack of will on the part of the executive to implement laws, lack of awareness among citizens, and lack of infrastructure. The court also discusses the issue of firecrackers and questions such as the maximum permissible sound level, method of checking compliance, and responsibility for implementation. The court suggests that the present noise standards prescribed by the government are correct and do not need to be altered at the moment. The court also discusses the Department of Explosives' role in enforcing noise standards and suggests that manufacturers should control the size and composition of firecrackers to comply with noise limits prescribed under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986.

The court order discusses the need to regulate the use of firecrackers in India to prevent noise pollution and health hazards. The court suggests fixing the chemical composition and size of firecrackers to conform to noise emission norms, rather than measuring noise levels at the time of bursting. The court also rejects requests for relaxation of restrictions on bursting firecrackers during festivals and suggests collective celebration of festivals with fireworks away from residential areas. The court concludes that the total restriction on bursting firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am must continue without any relaxation.

The court order restricts the use of firecrackers between 10 pm and 6 am without any exceptions. The court also states that the restriction does not violate religious rights as Diwali is associated with pooja and not firecrackers. The court suggests that firecrackers emitting colors or lights can be used instead of sound-emitting ones. The court also recommends creating awareness about the hazardous effects of noise pollution and regulating the use of loudspeakers and high sound-producing instruments. The court directs the Department of Explosives to come up with chemical formulae for firecrackers and divide them into two categories: sound-emitting and color/light-emitting. The court also allows the manufacture of firecrackers for export with higher noise levels subject to certain conditions. The court also sets a limit on the noise level at public places where loudspeakers or other noise sources are used.

The court order requires that products not intended for sale in India must carry a declaration to that effect. It also sets limits on noise levels from loudspeakers and other sources, and prohibits the use of horns at night in residential areas. The order calls for increased awareness of the hazards
