The Jharkhand High Court recently heard several writ petitions related to the grant of mining leases for various minerals in different areas of Jharkhand. The petitioners requested the State of Jharkhand to issue orders for the grant of leases for minerals covered under Part-C of Schedule-I, for which approval had been granted by the Central Government earlier. The court summarized the individual petitions and the approvals granted by the Central Government for each mineral.

In another court order, the court addressed three separate writ petitions filed by different parties seeking grant of mining leases for limestone, quartz and bauxite in different villages of West Singhbhum and Gumla districts in Jharkhand. The court noted that prior approval of the Central Government under Section 5(1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 has been granted for all the leases. The court directed the State Government to take a decision on the grant of mining leases in accordance with law, without being inhibited by the deadline prescribed under Rule 8(1)(a) of the Minerals (Other Than Atomic and Hydro Carbons Energy Minerals) Concessions Rules, 2016. The court also took note of a recent notification issued by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, which enables project proponents to be granted leases without waiting for forest clearance stage-(I) and (II) and environmental clearance, subject to certain conditions.
