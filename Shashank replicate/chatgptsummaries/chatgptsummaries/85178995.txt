The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M/s New Krishna Stone Industries against the State of Punjab and others. The petitioner had appealed to the Appellate Authority under the Air and Water Acts, seeking a stay on orders to dismantle their stone crusher, which they claimed was more than 50 meters away from the river edge. The petitioner's counsel argued that irreparable loss would be caused if the stay application was not heard and the stone crusher was dismantled. 

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, disposed of the writ petition with a direction to the respondent to decide the stay application filed by the petitioner on 12.08.2014 or 13.08.2014. This means that the petitioner's request for a stay on the dismantling of their stone crusher will be considered by the respondent on the specified dates. 

It is important to note that the petitioner's claim that their stone crusher was more than 50 meters away from the river edge is significant. This is because the Air and Water Acts have strict regulations regarding the distance of industrial activities from water bodies. If the petitioner's claim is found to be true, then they may have a valid case for the stay on the dismantling of their stone crusher. 

However, it is also important to consider the potential environmental impact of the stone crusher. Stone crushing is known to release harmful pollutants into the air and water, which can have serious health and environmental consequences. The court will need to carefully consider both the petitioner's claim and the potential environmental impact before making a decision on the stay application. 

Overall, the court's direction to the respondent to consider the stay application filed by the petitioner is a positive development for the petitioner. It gives them an opportunity to make their case and potentially avoid the dismantling of their stone crusher. However, it is important to ensure that environmental concerns are also taken into account in the decision-making process.
