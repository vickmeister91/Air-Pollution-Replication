The fourth court order pertains to a group of writ petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all claiming relief from an impugned demand notice for the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land. The controversy involves mining activity for serpentine mineral within a mining lease allotted to the petitioner, which is part of a cluster of mines located in and around Rishabhdev area in Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur. The land earmarked as 'forest land' under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, after the Central Government has been diverted for the purpose of excavating serpentine mineral. The petitioner deposited the one-time amount as consideration/compensation for diversion of the forest land coming in the said Rishabhdev cluster, and such funds were thus diverted to the Forest Department. The Government of India issued a notification on 01.04.2015 mentioning therein that there would be no renewal of any mining lease in future and the tenure of present mining lease shall be of 50 years subject to the validity of approvals accorded under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which shall be extended up to a period co-terminus with the period of mining lease. The State Government was thereafter required to realize the NPV from the user agency i.e. Mining Department within a period of two years from the date of notification dated 01.04.2015, and the amount was to be kept by the Government in 'CAMPA Fund' for maintaining the ecological balance of the area. The petitioner and other mining lease holders deposited a sum of Rs.8,79,53,196/- on a pro-rata basis at the rate of Rs.14,40,000/- per hectare on 25.10.2017 under protest with the Mining Department.

The fifth court order pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were not responsible for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and the common area being utilized by cluster members. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

The sixth court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire area.

The seventh court order pertains to a dispute between mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land. The court found that the mining lease holders had collectively submitted a proposal for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, which included cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases, and therefore, segregation of these leases was not possible. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the 62 cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

In summary, the court orders relate to various disputes between mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of compensation and Net Present Value for forest land. The court has examined various documents related to the cases and heard arguments from both sides before making its decisions. The court has directed the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, but excluding the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases. The court has also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
