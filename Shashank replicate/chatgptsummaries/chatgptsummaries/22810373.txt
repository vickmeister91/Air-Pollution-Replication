The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Raju Yadav under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. for a crime registered under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The prosecution alleges that Yadav and his co-accused hunted a spotted deer by planting live electric wire in a field. The defense argues that Yadav has been falsely implicated and there is no direct evidence to connect him with the crime.

After hearing both sides, the court allows the bail application and directs Yadav to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and one surety in the like amount. The order also lists six conditions that Yadav must comply with, including cooperating in the trial and not committing a similar offense.

The first condition is that Yadav must not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses. This is a standard condition in most bail orders, as it is important to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and without any interference.

The second condition is that Yadav must attend all court hearings and cooperate with the investigation. This is also a standard condition, as it ensures that the accused does not abscond or delay the trial.

The third condition is that Yadav must not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission. This condition is imposed to ensure that the accused does not flee the country or evade trial.

The fourth condition is that Yadav must surrender his passport, if any, to the court. This is also a standard condition, as it ensures that the accused does not leave the country without permission.

The fifth condition is that Yadav must not commit a similar offense while on bail. This condition is imposed to ensure that the accused does not repeat the same offense while out on bail.

The sixth and final condition is that Yadav must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and one surety in the like amount. This is a standard condition in most bail orders, as it ensures that the accused has a financial stake in complying with the conditions of bail.

In conclusion, the court order allows Raju Yadav's bail application and imposes six conditions that he must comply with, including cooperating in the trial and not committing a similar offense. These conditions are standard in most bail orders and are designed to ensure that the accused does not interfere with the trial or abscond.
