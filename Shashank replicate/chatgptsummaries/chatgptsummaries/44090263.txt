The Karnataka High Court has issued a court order pertaining to a group of stone crushing companies in the state who have filed writ petitions seeking to quash closure notices issued by the state pollution control board. The court notes that the licenses of the companies are valid and that they have applied to the competent authority to operate their crushing units pending consideration of their applications. 

The court cites a previous judgment in a similar case and directs the respondents to permit the operation of the petitioner at the present site until their application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority.
