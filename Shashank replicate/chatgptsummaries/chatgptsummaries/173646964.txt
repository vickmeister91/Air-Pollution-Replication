The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order in a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest. The petitioners also challenged the government's notification declaring their mining leases as protected forest.

The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that the purpose of the provision is to protect forest land during the interregnum period until the government can determine the nature and extent of rights of the state and private persons in or over the forest land. The court also noted the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover, citing previous cases where the Supreme Court has intervened in public interest to protect the environment.

The court order discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court also emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The court's decision to uphold the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area is a significant victory for environmental protection. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision to suspend mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology is also a positive step towards environmental protection. The court's appointment of committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife is also a welcome move.

Overall, the court's order is a significant victory for environmental protection and highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy and should serve as a guiding principle for future environmental protection efforts.
