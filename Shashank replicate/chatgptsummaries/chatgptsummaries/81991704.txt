The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed several orders regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Srigangangar district in Rajasthan. The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh. The NGT directed the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. 

The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water. The court also directed the state to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and its distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. However, due to ongoing maintenance work, water samples from the distributories could not be collected. 

The State was given six months to construct waste water drains and one and a half years to remove encroachments. The court also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court imposed a cost of Rs. 50,000/- if the State failed to submit the long and short term plans and action taken report. The District Collector was directed to be present on the next hearing date. The State was also directed to furnish copies of compliance reports to the applicant.

The court order dated 10th September 2015 considered the issue of encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas. The Division Bench constituted a committee to demarcate the encroachments and monitor their removal. The State Government was directed to remove all encroachments within one month and provide assistance to monitor the removal. The compliance report filed by the State did not disclose how many encroachers had obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The State was directed to comply with the directions in letter and spirit, without failure, and remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. The compliance report was to be filed by 29th January 2016. 

The State Government was also directed to issue notice to the persons who were contributing to the pollution as to why they should not pay compensation of Rs. 25,000/- and the same be deposited in Environment Relief Fund. The compliance report filed on 4th December 2015, revealed that some of the encroachers had approached the Hon'ble High Court, apprehending that steps would be taken for their removal. The State Government was directed to prepare a comprehensive short term and long term scheme with a time frame for the purpose of preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and for removal of encroachment situated on the water bodies.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of a water body in Rajasthan. The court has ordered the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court has also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction to hear civil cases related to environmental issues. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and has stated that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available if the inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy.

The court order states that a writ court may deviate from the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the court if the inferior court or tribunal acts without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. However, it is within the court's discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if the order is without jurisdiction and in breach of fundamental rights. In this case, the petitioner sought a deviation from the doctrine, but the court found that the tribunal had jurisdiction and dismissed the writ petition. The petitioner was allowed to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation by December 31, 2016, and the state authorities were restrained from taking any coercive action until then. The NGT was expected to consider the delay in approaching it sympathetically.

In summary, the court orders pertain to the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Srigangangar district in Rajasthan. The NGT has directed the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The court has also suggested that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction to hear civil cases related to environmental issues.
