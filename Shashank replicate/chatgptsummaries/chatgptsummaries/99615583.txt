The Bombay High Court heard multiple writ petitions related to sugar production and distribution in Maharashtra and India. The petitioners challenged the actions of various government departments and officials, including the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbar Raoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., the Union of India, and various government officials. The respondents included the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and various other government officials and organizations.

One of the writ petitions was filed by Grampanchayat Aashti, Taluka: Mohol, District: Solapur, against various respondents including the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Collector of Solapur, and the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board. Another writ petition was filed by Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd. against the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., and the Union of India.

The court order lists the parties involved in two writ petitions, WP.135 of 2013 and WRIT PETITION NO. 4542 OF 2013. The petitioners are Lokshakti Sugars & Allied Industries Ltd., Siddeshwar Navnad Wagaz, Shivaji Nanadev Surve, Amol Sakshan Chavan, and Balaji Mangal Patil. The respondents include the State of Maharashtra, the Commissioner of Sugar, the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board, and various other government officials and organizations. No details about the content of the petitions or the court's ruling are provided.

The court order pertains to multiple cases, including a public interest litigation and writ petitions, involving various parties such as Audumbarraoji Patil Sakhar Karkhana Ltd., the Commissioner of Sugar Maharashtra State, and the Union of India. The order includes summons to be served on the government pleaders appearing for the respective parties. The details of the cases and parties involved are provided in the order.

The court order also discusses the provisions of Clauses 6A to 6E of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966, which restrict the setting up of new sugar factories within a 15 km radius of existing sugar factories. The Commissioner of Sugar certified that the distance between Audumbarraoji's proposed sugar factory and existing sugar factories was more than 15 km, allowing Audumbarraoji to obtain the necessary certification to vacate an ad-interim relief granted earlier. However, other parties filed writ petitions challenging the certification. The order includes the explanations for terms such as "existing sugar factory" and "new sugar factory."

The court modified an interim order to allow private sugar factories to apply for aerial distance certificates, provided they did not receive financial assistance. Audumbarraoji and Lokshakti applied for these certificates, with Audumbarraoji being granted one and subsequently beginning construction on a new sugar factory. However, objections were raised by the Grampanchayat Aashti and Mahavir Digambar Aware, leading to a series of writ petitions and court orders. Ultimately, Audumbarraoji was restrained from continuing construction until all necessary permissions and certificates were obtained. The Commissioner of Sugar issued a public notice for objections to the establishment of the sugar factory, with nine objections being received. The matter remained pending as of September 2013.

The court order discusses a dispute over the grant of an aerial distance certificate to two sugar factories, Lokshakti and Audumbarraoji. The court refers to a previous case, Gangamai, which established that the Survey of India has the power to determine the minimum distance between sugar factories. The court determines that Audumbarraoji's application for the certificate was made earlier and therefore justified, despite objections from Lokshakti. The court also notes that the change of name from Gopal Krishna Sakhar Karkhana Limited to Audumbarraoji Sakhar Karkhana Limited was legal and that both entities are the same. Ultimately, the court rejects Lokshakti's claim that their application was rejected erroneously.

The court order pertains to a dispute between two sugar factories over the grant of an aerial distance certificate. The court found that the Commissioner of Sugar was justified in granting the certificate to one factory and refusing it to the other. The court also addressed a public interest litigation seeking directions to the Commissioner of Sugar to implement a circular and not grant crushing licenses to factories that have constructed their factories at a different location than mentioned in the Survey of India or in the IEM. The petitioner argued that the IEM granted to one factory had become inoperative due to non-compliance with the provisions of the Sugarcane Control Order, 1966. The court heard arguments from both sides and made a decision.

The court order discusses a case involving a sugar factory and its compliance with government regulations regarding the minimum distance between sugar factories. The court considers arguments from both sides and ultimately concludes that the factory in question did take effective steps within the required time frame and that a change in location was permissible under government regulations. The court also references a previous case to support its decision.

The court order discusses a case involving Jaywant Sugars Limited and their application for further amendment to their Industrial Entrepreneur Memorandum (IEM). The court determines that the modification and substitution in the acknowledgement dated January 12, 2006, was to be
