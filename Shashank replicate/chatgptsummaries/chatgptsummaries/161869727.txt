The first court order pertains to a civil suit filed by the Dashmesh Educational Society seeking permission to set up a Country Club/Resort at village Karoran, Tehsil Kharar, District Ropar. The suit was contested by the State of Punjab and the Punjab Urban Areas Development Authority (PUDA) on the grounds that the land falls within the purview of the Punjab Land Preservation Act 1900 and attracts the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. The suit was initially decreed in favor of the plaintiff, but the decision was reversed by the High Court. The Supreme Court has now directed the High Court to determine whether the land on which the resort/country club is sought to be established is forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The second court order pertains to two Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) filed against the High Court of Punjab & Haryana's order in a writ petition. The SLPs were initially tagged with two civil appeals but were later de-tagged and directed to be heard separately. The petitioners' contention was that the Notifications issued under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation (Chos) Act, 1900, were non est in law as they were issued under the old Section 3 of the Act. The High Court declined to go into the pleas raised in the writ petition on the ground that the writ petitions were highly belated, and a dispute pertaining to the land was pending before the court. The court dismissed both SLPs, stating that they did not consider it appropriate to entertain them any further.

The first court order revolves around the issue of whether the land on which the resort/country club is sought to be established is forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The Dashmesh Educational Society had filed a civil suit seeking permission to set up the Country Club/Resort, which was contested by the State of Punjab and PUDA on the grounds that the land falls within the purview of the Punjab Land Preservation Act 1900 and attracts the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980. The suit was initially decreed in favor of the plaintiff, but the decision was reversed by the High Court.

The Supreme Court has now directed the High Court to determine whether the land on which the resort/country club is sought to be established is forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This is an important issue as the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government. The Act defines forest land as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and any land which is predominantly covered by trees and has a canopy density of more than 40%.

The second court order pertains to two Special Leave Petitions (SLPs) filed against the High Court of Punjab & Haryana's order in a writ petition. The SLPs were initially tagged with two civil appeals but were later de-tagged and directed to be heard separately. The petitioners' contention was that the Notifications issued under Sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation (Chos) Act, 1900, were non est in law as they were issued under the old Section 3 of the Act.

The High Court declined to go into the pleas raised in the writ petition on the ground that the writ petitions were highly belated, and a dispute pertaining to the land was pending before the court. The court dismissed both SLPs, stating that they did not consider it appropriate to entertain them any further. This order essentially upholds the decision of the High Court and dismisses the SLPs filed by the petitioners.

In conclusion, the first court order directs the High Court to determine whether the land on which the resort/country club is sought to be established is forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The second court order dismisses two Special Leave Petitions filed against the High Court's order in a writ petition. Both orders have important implications for the use and preservation of land in Punjab.
