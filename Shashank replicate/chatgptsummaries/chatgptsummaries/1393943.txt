In the first court order, a petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking a writ of habeas corpus against the State of Uttar Pradesh, the Collector of Mathura, Senior Superintendent of Police Mathura, and Superintendent, District Jail, Mathura, in connection with the detention of the petitioners in Mathura jail. The petitioners were arrested for allegedly causing disturbance near a meeting arranged by the District Congress Committee of Mathura and were subsequently detained for failing to furnish security for their appearance at the next date fixed for the hearing of the case.

The court examined the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure and concluded that the Magistrate was authorized to require the petitioners to furnish security for their appearance and commit them to jail custody at their refusal to do so. The court also found that the order made under Section 112 of the Criminal Procedure Code was read out and explained to the petitioners and that they were presented before the Magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest.

In the second court order, the legality of the detention of several petitioners who were arrested and committed to jail custody for failing to furnish security for their appearance in court was questioned. The court examined whether the Magistrate had the authority to demand security and commit the petitioners to custody, and whether Section 344 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies to proceedings under Chapter VIII.

The court concluded that the Magistrate had the power to demand security and commit the petitioners to custody, but their detention was illegal because no proper order remanding them to custody was recorded in accordance with Section 344. The petitioners who have furnished security and been released are not entitled to relief, but those still in jail custody are.

In the third court order, it was stated that some petitioners who furnished bonds for their appearance have been released, but others who are still in jail are entitled to be released because their detention is illegal. The court found that the Magistrate had the power to demand bail for appearance. The order directs the release of nine specific petitioners.

Overall, these court orders deal with the legality of the detention of petitioners who were arrested and committed to jail custody for failing to furnish security for their appearance in court. The court examined the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and concluded that the Magistrate had the power to demand security and commit the petitioners to custody, but their detention was illegal because no proper order remanding them to custody was recorded in accordance with Section 344. The court ordered the release of specific petitioners who were still in jail custody.
