The court has allowed the bail application and ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each for his appearance before the court on all hearing dates.

The decision to grant bail to Bhagwandas Singh was made after considering various factors such as the nature of the offenses, the evidence against him, and his past criminal record. The court also took into account the fact that the accused had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that he had cooperated with the investigation.

The offenses for which Bhagwandas Singh was arrested are serious in nature and carry severe penalties. Section 332 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, while Section 353 deals with assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty. Section 307 of the IPC deals with attempt to murder, while Section 379 deals with theft.

In addition to these offenses, Bhagwandas Singh was also charged under Section 3/25 of the Arms Act, which deals with possession of firearms without a license, and Sections 41 and 42 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, which deal with illegal felling of trees and possession of forest produce without a license.

The accused is still required to appear before the court on all hearing dates and cooperate with the investigation.
