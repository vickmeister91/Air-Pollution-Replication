The court order in question pertains to an application filed by Om Prakash Pandey seeking to quash the proceedings against him under Section 13(1)E, 13(2) r/w Prevention of Corruption Act 1988. Pandey argued that there was an error in the calculation of his income from all known sources and that his defence had not been taken into consideration. However, the court refused to quash the proceedings, stating that the defence cannot be considered at this stage and that only a prima facie case needs to be seen.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the charges against Pandey were serious in nature and that there was sufficient evidence to suggest that he had committed the offences in question. The court also noted that the trial court had already considered the evidence against Pandey and had found that there was a prima facie case against him.

Despite this, the court did acknowledge that Pandey had the right to defend himself and that his defence should be taken into consideration at the appropriate stage of the trial. In this regard, the court directed that if Pandey moves an application for discharge within 15 days, the same shall be disposed of by the trial court in accordance with the law within 30 days.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that all accused persons are given a fair trial and that their rights are protected. It also underscores the need for courts to carefully consider the evidence against an accused person before deciding whether to quash the proceedings against them.

In conclusion, while the court refused to quash the proceedings against Om Prakash Pandey, it did acknowledge his right to defend himself and directed that his defence should be taken into consideration at the appropriate stage of the trial. This decision is an important reminder of the need to ensure that all accused persons are given a fair trial and that their rights are protected.
