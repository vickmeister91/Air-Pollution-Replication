On December 3, 2019, Judge Santosh Massey digitally signed a court order pertaining to a bail application filed by Hemant, also known as Bablu Batti, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The prosecution alleges that Hemant was found in possession of tiger skin and whiskers, which he claims to have purchased from a co-accused five years ago.

The court has allowed the bail application, directing Hemant to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code states that a person released on bail must attend the court on all dates of hearing and not commit any offence while on bail.

The court order does not provide any information about the content of the order, other than the decision to grant bail to Hemant. It is unclear whether any conditions were imposed on Hemant's release, such as surrendering his passport or reporting to the police station regularly.

The case against Hemant highlights the issue of wildlife trafficking in India. Tigers are a protected species under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, and their trade is illegal. The demand for tiger parts, such as skin and bones, is driven by traditional Chinese medicine and the illegal wildlife trade. India is home to over half of the world's tiger population, but their numbers have declined due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict.

The court's decision to grant bail to Hemant raises questions about the effectiveness of wildlife protection laws in India. Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime that threatens the survival of endangered species and undermines conservation efforts. It is important for the judiciary to take a strong stance against wildlife crime and impose strict penalties on offenders.

In conclusion, the court order signed by Judge Santosh Massey on December 3, 2019, granted bail to Hemant, also known as Bablu Batti, in connection with a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act. The prosecution alleges that Hemant was found in possession of tiger skin and whiskers, which he claims to have purchased from a co-accused five years ago. The court directed Hemant to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 30,000 and comply with the provisions of Section 437(3) Cr.P.C. The court order does not provide any information about the content of the order, other than the decision to grant bail to Hemant. The case highlights the issue of wildlife trafficking in India and the need for stronger enforcement of wildlife protection laws.
