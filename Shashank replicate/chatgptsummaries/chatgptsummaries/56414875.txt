The National Green Tribunal heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The appeals were filed in response to orders issued on July 29, 2013. The companies were accused of polluting the environment and violating environmental regulations. The case was heard by Hon'ble Justice Shri M. Chockalingam and Hon'ble Prof. Dr. R. Nagendran.

The court order pertains to appeals filed by granite cutting and polishing units in Byndahalli and Kadabagare villages in Bangalore North, challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board under section 33(A) of Water (Prevention and control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and rule 34 of Karnataka State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution (Procedure for Transaction Business) Rules and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1976. The appellants argue that their units do not cause air or water pollution and have obtained necessary permissions and licenses. The Board issued closure directions based on a government notification that prohibits industrial activity within 1 km of the Arkavathi river bank. The appellants argue that their units are located over 1 km away and that the government order is illegal. The court is considering whether the closure orders and consequential disconnection of power supply were legal and whether the appellants were given an opportunity to be heard.

The court dismissed appeals by industries engaged in granite cutting and polishing activities, who were directed to close operations by the State Board for the Prevention and Control of Pollution. The appellants did not obtain consent to establish or operate their industries, and some obtained consent by misrepresentation of facts. The government had issued a notification classifying the entire TGR catchment area into 4 zones, specifying the nature of activities in each zone. The industries of the appellants were established within the radius of 1 km from the river bank, in Zone 3, where no Orange Categorised industries were permitted. The court upholds the directions for closure of the units, as the appellants were operating illegally and causing pollution of water in the TGR catchment area.

The court order states that the appellants were operating their units illegally without the consent of the Board, and that their argument of obtaining necessary licenses from local authorities was not valid. The closure orders were issued under the Water Act and Air Act, and in violation of government orders to protect the TGR catchment area. The court rejected the appellants' contentions and upheld the closure orders, stating that the appellants must remove all machinery and materials within three months.

In summary, the National Green Tribunal heard appeals from 16 granite cutting and polishing companies in Bangalore challenging the closure directions issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The companies were accused of polluting the environment and violating environmental regulations. The court considered whether the closure orders and consequential disconnection of power supply were legal and whether the appellants were given an opportunity to be heard.
