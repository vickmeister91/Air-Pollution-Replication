The court order, CWP/2760/2018, issued on December 11, 2019, pertains to the delay in the construction of a motorable road from village Chhaniaage to village Najan. The petitioners claim that the road was sanctioned in 2010, but construction has not yet been completed. The government has laid the foundation stone but has not started construction from the proposed point. The government claims that the road's alignment passes through forest and private land, and the process of transfer of forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, has been initiated.

The petitioners have approached the court seeking directions to the government to complete the construction of the road. The court has directed the Advocate General to explain the reasons for the delay in construction on the next date of hearing. The court has also asked the government to file an affidavit explaining the steps taken to transfer the forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is a legislation enacted by the Indian government to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes must be approved by the central government. The act also requires that the diverted forest land must be compensated by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.

The delay in the construction of the road is a matter of concern for the petitioners as it has caused inconvenience to the residents of the area. The road is essential for the transportation of goods and services, and the delay in its construction has affected the economic activities of the area. The petitioners have argued that the delay in the construction of the road is a violation of their fundamental right to life and livelihood.

The court has taken note of the petitioners' concerns and has directed the government to explain the reasons for the delay in construction. The court has also asked the government to file an affidavit explaining the steps taken to transfer the forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The court's direction is a positive step towards ensuring that the government is held accountable for the delay in the construction of the road.
