The case in question involves a petition for bail filed by Triken Rajbangshi and Tapan Barman under Section 439 Cr.P.C. in connection with AWL/22/OR/42-43 under Sections 9/39 (1) d/40 (2)/48 (A)/49 (B)/50/51 of the Wild Life(Protection) Act, 1972. The accused persons are drivers by profession and were arrested on 26.02.2019 for carrying Chinese Pangolin in their vehicles. The offences allegedly committed by the accused petitioners are punishable with imprisonment for life and fine up to Rs.75,000/-.

The court, after considering the facts of the case, has found that if the liberty of bail is granted to the accused persons, further investigation is likely to be adversely affected. Therefore, the bail application stands rejected.
