In the first court order, the case pertains to a road accident that resulted in the death of a young man named R. Jaya Rajan. The offending vehicle was owned by M/s Hari Om Transport Co. and insured with Oriental Insurance Company. The court found that the deceased died in a motor vehicle accident due to the negligence of the respondents. The Insurance Company had taken a preliminary objection that they were not liable to pay compensation as the petitioners had failed to prove negligence on the part of the respondents. However, the court held that negligence was only one of the causes of action for making a claim for compensation in respect of accidents arising out of the use of motor vehicles. The court awarded compensation to the petitioners.

The second court order discusses the liability of motor vehicle owners in accidents and references the Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher as a potential basis for liability. The order also discusses various defenses recognized in common law against actions brought on the strength of this rule. The court emphasizes that burden of proof is a matter of law and pleadings, and that in some cases, the burden to prove negligence may be shifted to the respondent. The court cites several cases to support its position.

In the third court order, the bus driver and owner are liable to pay compensation to the appellants in a claim petition filed under Section 166 of the Act. The court found that the deceased was knocked down by the bus, and the injuries suffered by the deceased show that the bus had run over the deceased. The court applied the principles of res ipsa loquitur as there was no eyewitness to the accident. The court also considered the deceased's income and awarded compensation to the appellants. The insurance company disputed their liability, but the court found that the driver was not holding a valid driving license on the day of the accident. The insurance company was directed to deposit the awarded amount along with interest, and the court ordered that 70% of the amount be paid to petitioner No.1 and 30% to petitioner No.2.

In all three court orders, the issue of liability and compensation in motor vehicle accidents is discussed. The first court order emphasizes that negligence is only one of the causes of action for making a claim for compensation in respect of accidents arising out of the use of motor vehicles. This means that even if negligence cannot be proven, compensation can still be awarded. The second court order discusses the Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, which holds that a person who brings something onto their land that is likely to do mischief if it escapes is strictly liable for any damage caused by it. This rule can be applied to motor vehicle accidents, making the owner of the vehicle strictly liable for any damage caused by it. However, the court also recognizes various defenses against this rule, such as the act of God defense and the act of a third party defense.

The third court order applies the principles of res ipsa loquitur, which means "the thing speaks for itself." This principle allows the court to infer negligence from the circumstances of the accident, even if there is no direct evidence of negligence. In this case, the fact that the bus ran over the deceased is enough to infer negligence on the part of the driver and owner. The court also considers the deceased's income in awarding compensation, which is a common practice in such cases.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of liability and compensation in motor vehicle accidents. They also demonstrate the various legal principles and defenses that can be applied in such cases. It is important for both vehicle owners and insurance companies to understand these principles in order to properly assess liability and compensation in the event of an accident.
