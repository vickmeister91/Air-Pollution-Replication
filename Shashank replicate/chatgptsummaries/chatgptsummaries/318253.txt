The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Noorul Mubin, who sought to quash the proceedings against him in a case related to hunting and killing of bison. However, the court has dismissed the petition, stating that the acquittal of co-accused does not automatically entitle the petitioner to be acquitted. The court has also noted that the petitioner has not appeared in court despite several non-bailable warrants being issued against him.

The court has emphasized that the power to quash proceedings under section 482 of Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in rarest of rare cases. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers the High Court to quash any criminal proceedings if it deems it necessary to do so in the interest of justice. However, the court has made it clear that this power should not be used to interfere with the normal course of justice or to protect the accused from facing trial.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition filed by Noorul Mubin is based on several factors. Firstly, the court has noted that the acquittal of co-accused does not automatically entitle the petitioner to be acquitted. Each accused is tried separately, and the acquittal of one accused does not necessarily mean that the other accused will also be acquitted. In this case, the court has found sufficient evidence against Noorul Mubin to proceed with the trial.

Secondly, the court has taken note of the fact that the petitioner has not appeared in court despite several non-bailable warrants being issued against him. This is a serious matter, as it shows a lack of respect for the court and the legal process. The court has made it clear that it will not tolerate such behavior and that the petitioner must appear in court to face trial.

Finally, the court has emphasized that the power to quash proceedings under section 482 of Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in rarest of rare cases. This is because the normal course of justice should not be interfered with unless it is absolutely necessary to do so in the interest of justice. In this case, the court has found that there is sufficient evidence against Noorul Mubin to proceed with the trial, and that there is no reason to quash the proceedings.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Noorul Mubin, seeking to quash the proceedings against him in a case related to hunting and killing of bison. However, the court has dismissed the petition, stating that the acquittal of co-accused does not automatically entitle the petitioner to be acquitted. The court has also noted that the petitioner has not appeared in court despite several non-bailable warrants being issued against him. The court has emphasized that the power to quash proceedings under section 482 of Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in rarest of rare cases. The court's decision is based on several factors, including the fact that there is sufficient evidence against Noorul Mubin to proceed with the trial, and that the petitioner must appear in court to face trial.
