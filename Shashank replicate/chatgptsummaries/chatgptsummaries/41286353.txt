The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by C.R. Jisha against the State of Kerala and other respondents. Jisha had obtained all necessary permissions and certificates to set up a retail outlet of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. on leased land. However, she was served with a stop memo for violating the provisions of the KLU Order. The court stayed the operation of the stop memo and allowed Jisha to continue her activities.

The KLU Order is the Kerala Land Utilisation Order, which regulates the use of land in the state. The violation in this case was in respect of excess soil excavated from the land, and proceedings were initiated against the landowner for the same. The court quashed the stop memo to the extent it related to Jisha and allowed the respondents to pursue action against the landowner.

The court order was signed by Judge A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar. However, no information is provided about the content of the order beyond what is mentioned in the summary.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining all necessary permissions and certificates before setting up any business or activity on leased land. It also underscores the need for compliance with regulations such as the KLU Order to avoid legal complications.

The court's decision to allow Jisha to continue her activities despite the stop memo is a positive development for her business. However, the fact that proceedings were initiated against the landowner for the violation of the KLU Order suggests that there may be further legal action in this case.

Overall, the court order provides some clarity on the legal status of Jisha's business and the actions that can be taken against the landowner for the violation of regulations. However, without more information about the content of the order, it is difficult to fully assess its implications.
