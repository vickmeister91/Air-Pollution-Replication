Rambaran Rawat, the accused, filed a second application for anticipatory bail in relation to Crime No. 71/2018 registered by Police Station Karera, District Shivpuri for offences punishable under various acts. The police received information that sand was being illegally excavated from the bed of the river with the help of heavy machinery. When the police arrived, they found evidence of illegal excavation and storage of sand. The applicant was accused of being involved in the illegal excavation of sand. 

The court rejected the application for bail, considering the detrimental effects of illegal excavation on revenue, marine life, and the environment. The court observed that illegal sand mining is a serious offence that has a direct impact on the environment and the economy. The court also noted that illegal sand mining is a major source of revenue loss for the government. The court further observed that illegal sand mining has a direct impact on the marine life, as it disturbs the natural habitat of aquatic animals and plants.

The court also considered the fact that the applicant was involved in the illegal excavation of sand, which is a serious offence. The court observed that the applicant had violated the provisions of various acts, including the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, the Indian Penal Code, and the Environmental Protection Act, 1986. The court noted that the applicant had caused damage to the environment and had also caused a loss of revenue to the government.

The court also observed that the applicant had not cooperated with the investigation and had not provided any information about the other persons involved in the illegal excavation of sand. The court noted that the applicant had not shown any remorse for his actions and had not taken any steps to rectify the damage caused to the environment.

The court further observed that the applicant had a criminal history and had been involved in similar offences in the past. The court noted that the applicant had been convicted in a case of illegal mining in the past and had also been involved in other criminal activities.

The court, therefore, rejected the application for anticipatory bail filed by the applicant. The court observed that the applicant had committed a serious offence that had a direct impact on the environment and the economy. The court also noted that the applicant had not cooperated with the investigation and had not shown any remorse for his actions. The court, therefore, held that the applicant was not entitled to anticipatory bail and directed him to surrender before the police.
