The Indian judiciary has issued a court order directing all concerned states to follow restrictions and prohibitions regarding construction and setting up of industries in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The order prohibits any prohibited activities within the zone and mandates that permissible activities must be strictly followed. The petitioner's request to constitute a central authority and an authority in each coastal state/union territory is under consideration.

The Coastal Regulation Zone is a coastal area that is regulated by the Indian government to protect the environment and coastal communities. The zone is divided into four categories based on the level of development and population density. The CRZ notification of 2011 outlines the activities that are prohibited or regulated in each category.

The court order is significant as it reinforces the importance of protecting the environment and coastal communities. The CRZ is a critical area that is vulnerable to environmental degradation and natural disasters. The order ensures that the regulations are followed and that the environment is protected.

The court has examined an interim site visit report of violations in the Coastal Regulation Zone of the State of Goa. The report highlights the violations of the CRZ notification and the damage caused to the environment. The court has issued notice to the Ministry of Environment and Forest and the State of Goa to file affidavits indicating the action taken in respect of the report.

The notice is a significant step towards ensuring that the violations are addressed and the environment is protected. The Ministry of Environment and Forest and the State of Goa are required to provide a detailed report on the action taken to address the violations. The report will be crucial in determining the effectiveness of the regulations and the need for further action.

The petitioner's request to constitute a central authority and an authority in each coastal state/union territory is under consideration. The authorities will be responsible for enforcing the regulations and ensuring that the environment is protected. The authorities will also be responsible for monitoring the activities in the CRZ and taking action against violations.
