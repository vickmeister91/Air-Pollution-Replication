The court orders discussed in this summary cover a range of topics related to noise pollution and the regulation of loudspeakers and other mechanical instruments in public and private spaces. The first order deals with a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution seeking a Mandamus to prevent respondents 1 to 3 from giving permission to the fifth respondent for playing a microphone in a private temple. The petitioner alleged that the fifth respondent had illegally constructed a Kalyana Mandapam without obtaining a sanctioned plan and was causing immense nuisance to the petitioner's family by playing music through a microphone at odd hours. The fifth respondent denied the allegations and stated that he had obtained an approved plan for the Kalyana Mandapam and had constructed an Amman Temple near it for people to pray before marriages. He also stated that he was not interested in playing music in the private temple and would not apply for permission from respondents 2 to 4 for the same. The court dealt with the subject of aural aggression and stated that under the Constitution, all citizens have the right to liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, and discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth is prohibited.

The court order discusses various articles of the Indian Constitution, including Article 14 which prohibits discrimination, Article 15 which prohibits discrimination on certain grounds subject to some exceptions, and Article 19 which outlines the rights of citizens including freedom of speech and expression subject to reasonable restrictions. The order also highlights the importance of balancing individual rights with social welfare and the need to protect public health from noise pollution.

The court order discusses the effects of noise on sleep, the hypothalamohypophyseal-adrenal axis, and various bodily functions. It also mentions a Supreme Court case regarding the use of amplifying devices in public places and the balance between free speech and the rights of others. Another case is discussed regarding the regulation of sound amplifiers on streets and public places. The court ultimately upholds the right to regulate conduct on public property as long as it does not infringe on constitutional liberties.

The court order discusses the regulation of the use of loudspeakers and other mechanical instruments during public meetings. The court states that while freedom of speech and expression is important, it must be balanced with the need to maintain public order and prevent excessive noise that may disturb others. The court also notes that the denial of permission to use a loudspeaker must not be arbitrary and must not infringe on the fundamental right of freedom of communication. Overall, the court emphasizes the importance of balancing individual liberties with social control.

The court order prohibits the arbitrary use of loudspeakers and states that the right to be free from noise is guaranteed under Article 21. The court also provides guidelines for the use of loudspeakers, including restrictions on volume and duration of use, and the requirement for warning about consequences of violation of any condition. The court emphasizes that no religion prescribes that prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others and that activities which disturb old or infirm persons, students, or children having their sleep in the early hours or during day-time or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted. The court also highlights the importance of honoring the rights of aged, sick, people afflicted with psychic disturbances as well as children up to 6 years of age who are considered to be very sensible to noise.

The court order specifies that noise levels in any area should not exceed the ambient air quality standards. The authority is responsible for enforcing noise pollution control measures and restrictions on the use of loudspeakers and public address systems. Violators will be penalized. Citizens and implementation authorities need to be aware of the rules and enforce them. The court cites previous cases to show that the right to make noise is not absolute and can be subject to regulation and restrictions. The court also mentions the need to control burning near human habitation.

The court order discusses the concept of nuisance and how it is determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all the circumstances. It also mentions relevant laws and regulations related to noise pollution and the duty of statutory authorities to enforce them. The court emphasizes the importance of citizens fulfilling their duties as outlined in Article 51-A of the Indian Constitution, which includes promoting harmony and protecting the environment. The order concludes by stating that liberty is not just a personal affair but a social contract that requires individuals to consider the interests of others.

The court order emphasizes that personal liberty of action is qualified by the rights and feelings of others. It is the duty of the State to protect the fundamental right to life of the citizen, including the right to live with human dignity and the bare necessities of life. Rule of law requires that all laws be faithfully executed, orders of courts be obeyed, and power not be arbitrarily exercised. The lack of discipline in observing rules and obeying laws is a casualty in daily life, and the despicable philosophy of 'might is right' should make way to the wholesome 'rule of law'. The court order also highlights the importance of fundamental duties corresponding to fundamental rights.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the importance of balancing individual rights with social welfare and the need to protect public health from noise pollution. They provide guidelines for the use of loudspeakers and other mechanical instruments in public and private spaces, and emphasize the importance of enforcing noise pollution control measures and restrictions. The court orders also highlight the duty of citizens to promote harmony and
