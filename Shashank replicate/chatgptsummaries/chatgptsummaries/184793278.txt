Three court orders were discussed in the given summaries. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking to quash an order rejecting his representation for removal of quartz from his mining leases. The second order discusses a writ petition challenging the rejection of a request for extension of a transit permit to remove minerals from a leasehold area. The third order dismisses a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking an extension of time for a transit permit to remove minerals from a mining lease.

In the first order, the petitioner claimed that the orders rejecting his representation were arbitrary, illegal, and mala fide. The Advocate General, on the other hand, argued that the orders were valid and legal. The court noted that disputed questions of fact were involved and ultimately did not quash the orders.

In the second order, the court noted that disputed questions of fact were involved and could not be adjudicated by the court. The petitioner was accused of not approaching the court with clean hands and of raising minerals from outside the leasehold area. The court also noted that the petitioner had not submitted required forms and returns, and had violated the covenants of the lease deed. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

In the third order, the Director of Mines reported that the petitioner had submitted a false solvency certificate for the grant of two mining leases. The court stated that the reasons for rejecting the petitioner's request and their reply involved disputed questions of fact that could not be adjudicated by the court. The petitioner was facing action from the State Pollution Control Board, proceedings for royalty realization, and criminal cases for submitting a forged solvency certificate. The court dismissed the writ petition and expressed no opinion on the merit of the other cases.

In all three orders, the court noted that disputed questions of fact were involved and could not be adjudicated by the court. The court also noted that the petitioners had not complied with the required forms and returns, and had violated the covenants of the lease deed. Additionally, the third order revealed that the petitioner had submitted a false solvency certificate, which led to criminal cases against them.

These court orders highlight the importance of complying with the legal requirements and being truthful in representations made to the authorities. The court cannot adjudicate disputed questions of fact and will not entertain petitions filed with unclean hands. It is essential for individuals and entities to follow the legal procedures and requirements to avoid legal complications and consequences.
