The court order pertains to a revision under Section 6-B of the Court-fees Act. The Chief Inspector of Stamps, U.P., filed a revision against the order of the Additional District Judge of Saharanpur, who held that the court fee paid on E.E. Act Appeal No. 3 of 1958 was sufficient. The case involved a reduction in the amount of a decree passed in favour of Ugger Sen, ex-zamindars, under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952. Ugger Sen challenged the order by way of appeal, and affixed a court-fee stamp of Rs. 2.50 Paise on the memorandum of appeal. 

The Inspector of Stamps raised an objection that the court-fee paid was not sufficient, and ad valorem court-fee under Schedule I, Article 1, was payable. The learned Additional District Judge rejected the objection raised by the Inspector of Stamps and also by the respondents, chiefly on the ground that Ugger Sen had three remedies available. The court held that court-fee was payable under Schedule I, Article 1 of the Court-fees Act, and not under Schedule II, Article 11, thereof. The Court-fee already paid was insufficient by Rs. 2022.50 Paise.

The Court-fee Act, 1870, is an Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to court fees. The Act provides for the levy of court fees on documents filed in courts. The Act also prescribes the rates of court fees payable on different types of documents. The Act is applicable to all courts in India, except the Supreme Court and the High Courts, which have their own rules regarding court fees.

Section 6-B of the Court-fees Act deals with the revision of orders relating to court fees. The section provides that any person aggrieved by an order relating to court fees may apply for a revision of the order to the High Court. The High Court may, on such revision, confirm, modify or set aside the order.

In the present case, the Chief Inspector of Stamps, U.P., filed a revision under Section 6-B of the Court-fees Act against the order of the Additional District Judge of Saharanpur. The Inspector of Stamps contended that the court fee paid by Ugger Sen on the memorandum of appeal was not sufficient, and ad valorem court-fee under Schedule I, Article 1, was payable.

Schedule I, Article 1 of the Court-fees Act provides for ad valorem court-fee on plaints, written statements, and other documents filed in courts. The rate of court fee payable under this article is based on the value of the subject matter of the suit or proceeding. Schedule II, Article 11 of the Act provides for a fixed court fee of Rs. 2.50 Paise on appeals from orders under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952.

The learned Additional District Judge rejected the objection raised by the Inspector of Stamps and also by the respondents, chiefly on the ground that Ugger Sen had three remedies available. The court held that court-fee was payable under Schedule I, Article 1 of the Court-fees Act, and not under Schedule II, Article 11, thereof. The Court-fee already paid was insufficient by Rs. 2022.50 Paise.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the Court-fees Act and the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952. The court held that the appeal filed by Ugger Sen was not covered under Schedule II, Article 11 of the Court-fees Act, as the appeal was not against an order under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952. The court also held that Ugger Sen had three remedies available, namely, to file an appeal under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952, to file a suit for the recovery of the amount claimed, or to file a revision under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The court's decision has important implications for litigants who file appeals under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952. The decision clarifies that such appeals are not covered under Schedule II, Article 11 of the Court-fees Act, and ad valorem court-fee under Schedule I, Article 1, is payable. The decision also highlights the importance of interpreting the provisions of the Court-fees Act and other relevant laws correctly.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a revision under Section 6-B of the Court-fees Act. The court held that court-fee was payable under Schedule I, Article 1 of the Court-fees Act, and not under Schedule II, Article 11, thereof. The Court-fee already paid was insufficient by Rs. 2022.50 Paise. The court's decision has important implications for litigants who file appeals under the U.P. Zamindars' Debt Reduction Act, 1952, and highlights the importance of interpreting the provisions of the Court-fees Act and other relevant laws correctly.
