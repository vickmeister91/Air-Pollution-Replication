The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Vineet Kumar Jati against the State of Madhya Pradesh and others. Jati had established a rice mill in Jabalpur, which was ordered to be closed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate due to pollution concerns. Jati challenged this order and claimed that he was not given a hearing or notice before the action was taken.

The Pollution Control Board was also impleaded as a respondent in the case. During the proceedings, it was found that Jati had not obtained the necessary approvals and sanctions before establishing the rice mill. The court took note of this and directed Jati to file an appropriate application before the Pollution Control Board and comply with statutory requirements for obtaining permission to run the rice mill.

The court also directed the Pollution Control Board to consider Jati's application and take a decision within three months. This decision was made in light of the fact that the Pollution Control Board had not been given an opportunity to consider Jati's application before the Sub Divisional Magistrate ordered the closure of the rice mill.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining the necessary approvals and sanctions before establishing any industrial unit. It also emphasizes the need for authorities to provide a fair hearing and notice to individuals before taking any action against them.

The court's decision also underscores the role of the Pollution Control Board in regulating industrial activities and ensuring that they comply with environmental norms and standards. The Board has been given a clear mandate to consider Jati's application and take a decision within a specified timeframe.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a balanced one that takes into account the concerns of both the petitioner and the authorities. It recognizes the need for industrial development while also ensuring that environmental concerns are adequately addressed and that due process is followed.
