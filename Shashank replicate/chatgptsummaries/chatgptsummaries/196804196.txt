The first court order pertains to a case where the accused has filed an application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, seeking to quash an order passed by the learned Magistrate in a criminal case. Additionally, the accused had also filed an application under section 340 of the Code, seeking to initiate appropriate proceedings against the complainant for the offence of perjury. The court has directed the concerned court to ensure that the order dated 20th November 2014, is complied with in accordance with the law before proceeding further with the matter. The court has also directed that the criminal case be disposed of within a period of three months from the date of the order.

The second court order, unfortunately, does not provide any information to summarize a court order. It only mentions the page number and creation date of a document.

Going back to the first court order, it is important to understand the context of the case. The accused had filed an application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, which gives the High Court the power of superintendence over all courts and tribunals throughout the territory in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction. The accused was seeking to quash an order passed by the learned Magistrate in a criminal case. This means that the accused was asking the High Court to set aside the order passed by the Magistrate and declare it null and void.

In addition to this, the accused had also filed an application under section 340 of the Code, which deals with the procedure for cases involving perjury. Perjury is the offence of willfully lying under oath or affirmation in a court proceeding. The accused was seeking to initiate appropriate proceedings against the complainant for the offence of perjury. This means that the accused was alleging that the complainant had lied under oath or affirmation in the court proceeding and was seeking to take legal action against them.

The court, in its order, directed the concerned court to ensure that the order dated 20th November 2014, is complied with in accordance with the law before proceeding further with the matter. It is unclear what the order dated 20th November 2014, pertains to, but it is likely that it is a previous court order that needs to be followed before the case can proceed further.

The court also directed that the criminal case be disposed of within a period of three months from the date of the order. This means that the case needs to be resolved within three months from the date of the order, failing which the court may take further action.

In conclusion, the first court order pertains to a case where the accused was seeking to quash an order passed by the learned Magistrate in a criminal case and was also seeking to initiate appropriate proceedings against the complainant for the offence of perjury. The court directed the concerned court to ensure that a previous order is complied with before proceeding further with the matter and also directed that the criminal case be disposed of within a period of three months from the date of the order.
