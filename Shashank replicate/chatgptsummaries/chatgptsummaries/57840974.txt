The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes involving bakery businesses and their right to operate and make necessary repairs. In the first case, Sh. Gulsher and others filed a suit against Mohd. Yusuf and others seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants from interfering with the repair and installation of a furnace and chimney in a shop property. The plaintiffs were tenants of the property and ran a bakery business, while the defendants were legal heirs of the previous owner and had been demanding an increase in rent. The defendants had obstructed the installation of the furnace and chimney, but the plaintiffs were ultimately able to install them with police aid. The defendants argued that the suit was not maintainable and that the baking business was prohibited in the area, but the plaintiffs provided evidence, including licenses and court orders, to support their case. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and granted the relief of permanent injunction.

In the second case, the court in Delhi convicted defendants for deliberately flouting judicial orders and imposed a fine on some defendants for violating the order. The case was about the installation of a chimney and the repair of a furnace in a bakery business. The defendants obstructed the repairs, but the plaintiffs were able to install the chimney with police aid. The defendants argued that the suit was not maintainable and that the baking business was prohibited in the area. The plaintiff provided evidence, including licenses and court orders, to support their case. The plaintiff witness denied the defendants' suggestions and stuck to their version of events. The court found the defendants guilty of deliberately flouting judicial orders and imposed a fine on some defendants for violating the order.

The third court order discusses a case involving a bakery business and a dispute over the use of wood and charcoal to operate the bhatti. The plaintiff and defendant both gave testimony, with the plaintiff claiming to have the necessary permissions to operate the business and the defendant claiming that the plaintiffs were not authorized to manufacture bakery items. The court found that the defendants failed to prove their defense of ouster of civil court's jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs had a prima facie case for a permanent injunction to protect their right to carry on their business. The court ultimately granted the plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction.

The fourth court order pertains to a dispute between the plaintiffs and defendants over the right to manufacture and sell baked goods in a property. The defendants argued that the license only permitted the sale of baked goods and not their manufacture. However, the court found that the license allowed for the manufacture of baked goods and that the plaintiffs were entitled to renovate and repair the necessary equipment. The court also issued a permanent injunction against the defendants from interfering with the repair and installation of the equipment. The defendants' claim that the baking industry was hazardous and required relocation was not substantiated. The court awarded costs to the plaintiffs and decreed in their favor.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of having proper licenses and permissions to operate a business, as well as the right to make necessary repairs and renovations. The courts have consistently ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in these cases, granting them permanent injunctions to protect their right to carry on their bakery businesses. The defendants' arguments that the baking industry was prohibited or hazardous were not substantiated, and the courts found that the plaintiffs had a prima facie case for relief. These court orders serve as a reminder to all business owners to ensure that they have the necessary licenses and permissions to operate their businesses and to seek legal recourse if their rights are being infringed upon.
