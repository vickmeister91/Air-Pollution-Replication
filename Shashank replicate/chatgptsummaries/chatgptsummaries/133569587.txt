The Bombay High Court recently issued an order in response to a writ petition filed by Hindalco Industries Ltd. against the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and others. The court granted ad-interim relief to the petitioner, staying the effect and operation of an order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to close the petitioner's bauxite mine unit at Dhangarwadi and disconnect water and electricity supply. The court also issued notice to the respondents.

The petitioner, Hindalco Industries Ltd., had challenged the order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board to close its bauxite mine unit at Dhangarwadi and disconnect water and electricity supply. The petitioner had argued that the order was passed without following the principles of natural justice and without giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard.

The court noted that the petitioner had a remedy of appeal under Section 33(B) to the National Green Tribunal against an order passed under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, but no such appeal was prescribed in respect of an order passed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

The court observed that the petitioner had made out a prima facie case for grant of ad-interim relief. The court also noted that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner, as the closure of the bauxite mine unit would cause irreparable loss to the petitioner and its employees.

The court directed the respondents to file their reply to the writ petition and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.

This order is significant as it provides relief to the petitioner, Hindalco Industries Ltd., and stays the effect and operation of the order passed by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The court has also noted that the petitioner has a remedy of appeal under Section 33(B) to the National Green Tribunal against an order passed under Section 33(A) of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The court's observation that no such appeal is prescribed in respect of an order passed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is also significant. This observation highlights the need for a comprehensive legal framework to deal with environmental issues and provides an opportunity for the legislature to consider amending the existing laws to provide for a remedy of appeal in respect of orders passed under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.

Overall, the court's order provides relief to the petitioner and highlights the need for a comprehensive legal framework to deal with environmental issues. It remains to be seen how the matter progresses and whether the legislature takes note of the court's observations and considers amending the existing laws.
