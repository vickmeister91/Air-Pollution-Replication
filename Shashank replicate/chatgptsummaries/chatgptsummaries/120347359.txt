The first condition imposed by the court is that the applicants must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 each. This is a common condition imposed by courts while granting bail.

The accused are required to report to the police station on the specified days and sign a register to mark their presence.

The court has warned the accused that if any of the conditions are breached, appropriate action will be taken. This means that if the accused fail to comply with any of the conditions imposed by the court, their bail may be cancelled and they may be arrested again.
