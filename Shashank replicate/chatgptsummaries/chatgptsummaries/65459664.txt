In a recent criminal appeal case, Sh. Mangat Ram @ Mangtu filed an appeal against his conviction for possession of uncured skins of various animals in contravention of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The appellant argued that the skins were not in his conscious possession and that there were irregularities in the search and seizure process. However, the court rejected these arguments and upheld the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive legislation that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal or bird, and also prohibits the trade in any part or product derived from such animal or bird. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

In this case, the appellant was found to be in possession of uncured skins of various animals, which is a violation of the Act. The appellant argued that the skins were not in his conscious possession, but the court rejected this argument. The court held that the appellant was in possession of the skins and that he had failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he was not aware of their presence.

The appellant also argued that there were irregularities in the search and seizure process. However, the court found that the search and seizure were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Act and that there were no irregularities. The court held that the appellant had failed to prove that the search and seizure were illegal or that any evidence had been planted.

The court upheld the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court, which had sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for a period of three years and a fine of Rs. 10,000. The court held that the sentence was appropriate given the seriousness of the offence and the need to deter others from committing similar offences.

In conclusion, the court order in this case highlights the importance of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 in protecting wildlife and the need to enforce its provisions. The court's decision to uphold the conviction and sentence passed by the trial court sends a strong message that violations of the Act will not be tolerated and that offenders will be punished. The case also underscores the importance of providing evidence to support any claims made in court and the need to conduct searches and seizures in accordance with the law.
