The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case involving violations of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that while it has the power to review and reconsider evidence, it should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the decision is perverse. The court found that the appellant had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and upheld the lower court's decision.

The court order states that the appellant's advocate was unable to provide any evidence to contradict the trial court's decision to acquit the respondents of the charges against them. The court finds the trial court's decision to be just and proper, and therefore dismisses the appeal and cancels any bail bonds. The record and proceedings are to be sent back to the trial court.
