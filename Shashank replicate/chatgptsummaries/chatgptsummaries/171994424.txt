The Allahabad High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S C.L. Y. Brick Field Village and Another against the State of U.P. and five others. The petitioners had requested the court to quash an order passed by respondent no. 5 and to direct the respondents not to interfere in running their brick kiln. However, the court found that the impugned direction was issued because the petitioner was found running a brick kiln without obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The court did not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order, but stated that if the petitioner approaches the Board for a No Objection Certificate, their prayer shall be considered in accordance with the law.

The case involved a dispute between the petitioner and the U.P. Pollution Control Board over the operation of a brick kiln. The petitioner had been running the kiln without obtaining a No Objection Certificate from the Board, which is required under the law. The Board had issued a direction to the petitioner to stop the operation of the kiln until they obtained the necessary certificate. The petitioner had challenged this direction in court, arguing that they had been running the kiln for many years without any objection from the Board.

The court, however, found that the petitioner had been operating the kiln without obtaining the necessary certificate, and that the Board had the power to issue directions to stop such operations. The court also noted that the petitioner had not approached the Board for a No Objection Certificate, despite being aware of the requirement. The court, therefore, did not find any reason to interfere with the impugned order.

However, the court also stated that if the petitioner approaches the Board for a No Objection Certificate, their prayer shall be considered in accordance with the law. This means that if the petitioner complies with the requirements of the law and obtains the necessary certificate, they will be allowed to operate the kiln. The court's decision, therefore, provides a way for the petitioner to continue their business, but only if they comply with the law.

The case highlights the importance of obtaining the necessary permits and certificates before starting any business. The law requires businesses to obtain various permits and certificates to ensure that they operate in a manner that is safe for the environment and for the public. Failure to obtain these permits and certificates can result in legal action, as seen in this case.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision in the case of M/S C.L. Y. Brick Field Village and Another v. State of U.P. and five others highlights the importance of complying with the law when starting and operating a business. The court's decision provides a way for the petitioner to continue their business, but only if they obtain the necessary No Objection Certificate from the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The case serves as a reminder to all businesses to ensure that they comply with the law and obtain the necessary permits and certificates before starting their operations.
