The court order pertains to a case where a woman named Sonia died an unnatural death within seven years of her marriage. An FIR was registered against several accused, but only two were charged. The petitioner, who is Sonia's mother, filed an application for the constitution of a Medical Board to determine the cause of death.

The petitioner filed an application for further investigation of the matter, which was dismissed by the trial court.
