In 2012, a court order was issued to the Rupahi Union Co-Op Fishery and 21 others, directing them to demolish their structures on land covered by the Wild Life Protection Act. The order was not interfered with by the learned Single Judge, but alternative land was directed to be considered for the petitioners. The appellants claimed that no alternative land had been provided and that the status quo should be maintained. However, the court considered an earlier order from the Hon'ble Supreme Court that required the State to consider alternative land and maintain status quo until a decision was made.

The court found that the appellants cannot continue in the Wild Life Protection Area but that the State must consider alternative land. The order from 2012 was not quashed. The court order stands until the consideration is made, and further action is permitted after the lapse of the period.

In a subsequent court order, it was stated that the previous order from 2012 should have been quashed, but the appellants were also to blame for not providing enough details to justify their claim for alternate land. The court would only consider the actual number of members enrolled in the society before November 15, 1988, who were in physical possession of the land at that time and still are today.

The appellants were granted the benefit of filing a representation with the necessary details within one month, and the respondent Nos.2 and 4 would arrange for spot verification to identify the persons residing in the area. A list of eligible persons would be made, and a consideration for alternate land would be made within three months.

If the appellants did not provide the necessary details within the given time frame, they could not make any further grievance or claim any right. The court order stands until the consideration is made, and further action is permitted after the lapse of the period.

The court's decision was based on the Wild Life Protection Act, which aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act prohibits any construction or development within the protected areas without prior permission from the authorities. The court's decision was in line with the act's provisions and aimed to protect the wildlife and their habitats.

The court's decision also highlighted the importance of providing alternative land to those affected by the act's provisions. The court directed the State to consider alternative land for the appellants, which would allow them to continue their livelihoods without harming the wildlife and their habitats.

The court's decision was a balanced one, taking into account the interests of both the appellants and the wildlife. The court's decision was also in line with the principles of sustainable development, which aim to balance economic development with environmental protection.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case was based on the Wild Life Protection Act and aimed to protect the wildlife and their habitats. The court directed the State to consider alternative land for the appellants, which would allow them to continue their livelihoods without harming the wildlife and their habitats. The court's decision was a balanced one, taking into account the interests of both the appellants and the wildlife, and was in line with the principles of sustainable development.
