False implication can have severe consequences for the accused, including loss of reputation, financial loss, and even imprisonment.

The court's decision to grant bail to Singh is also a reminder that bail is not a right but a privilege. Bail is granted to an accused person to enable them to prepare their defense and to avoid the hardship of imprisonment before conviction. However, bail can be denied if the accused is likely to abscond, tamper with evidence, or commit a similar offense.
