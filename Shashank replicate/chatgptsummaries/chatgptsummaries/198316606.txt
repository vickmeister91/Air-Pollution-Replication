The court order in question pertains to a revision petition filed by Sabar Ali, who is accused of repeatedly raping a minor girl who was found to be carrying his child. Ali had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking direction to the prosecution to tender the complete DNA report, including the electro-foreto-gram generated on DNA sequencing machine, for proper and complete adjudication of the case. However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the report of the chemical examiner is per se admissible in evidence and that the opinion expressed therein by the scientific expert after chemical analysis is per se admissible.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the report of the chemical examiner is considered to be a primary piece of evidence in a case, and is therefore admissible in court without the need for any further corroboration. The court also noted that the opinion expressed by the scientific expert after chemical analysis is also considered to be admissible in court, as it is based on the expert's professional knowledge and experience.

In dismissing Ali's revision petition, the court held that there was no ground warranting intervention in the order. The court's decision was based on the fact that the DNA report had already been submitted as evidence in the case, and that the prosecution had relied on it to establish the paternity of the child. The court also noted that the DNA report had been prepared by a qualified scientific expert, and that it had been duly certified by the chemical examiner.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of DNA evidence in criminal cases, particularly in cases involving sexual assault and rape. DNA evidence is often considered to be a crucial piece of evidence in such cases, as it can help to establish the identity of the perpetrator and provide important information about the nature of the crime.

However, the admissibility of DNA evidence in court can be a complex issue, and it is important for both prosecutors and defense attorneys to understand the legal requirements for the admissibility of such evidence. In this case, the court's decision was based on the fact that the DNA report had been prepared by a qualified scientific expert and had been duly certified by the chemical examiner, which made it admissible in court without the need for any further corroboration.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the importance of DNA evidence in criminal cases, and highlights the need for prosecutors and defense attorneys to understand the legal requirements for the admissibility of such evidence. While DNA evidence can be a powerful tool in the fight against crime, it is important to ensure that it is properly collected, analyzed, and presented in court in order to ensure that justice is served.
