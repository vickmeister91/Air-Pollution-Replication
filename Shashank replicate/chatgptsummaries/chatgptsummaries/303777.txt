The Chattisgarh High Court has partially allowed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.PC, which challenged the issuance of summons against the petitioners by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur in Complaint Case No. 3850/04. The complaint was filed by the CG Environment Conservation Board for taking cognizance under Sections 37 and 40 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 read with Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioners.

The court found that necessary averments required under Section 40 of the Act, 1981 against petitioner Nos. 1 to 4 were missing in the complaint, and therefore, the process issued against them deserved to be quashed. However, it shall be open to the Board to file a fresh complaint, disclosing all necessary particulars, which may fasten the criminal liability against them, if they so desire.

The case pertains to the violation of environmental laws by the petitioners. The CG Environment Conservation Board had filed a complaint against them for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The petitioners were accused of causing air pollution by operating a sponge iron plant without obtaining the necessary consent from the State Pollution Control Board.

The court observed that the complaint filed by the Board did not contain the necessary averments required under Section 40 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 against petitioner Nos. 1 to 4. Section 40 of the Act deals with the power of the State Pollution Control Board to take samples of air or emission from any chimney or any outlet for the purpose of analysis. The court held that the complaint did not disclose any details regarding the sampling of air or emission from the chimney or outlet of the sponge iron plant operated by the petitioners.

The court further observed that the complaint did not disclose any details regarding the nature and extent of the pollution caused by the petitioners. The court held that the complaint did not contain any particulars regarding the quantity of pollutants emitted by the sponge iron plant operated by the petitioners, the duration of the emission, and the impact of the emission on the environment and public health.

The court held that the absence of necessary averments under Section 40 of the Act in the complaint filed by the Board was fatal to the case against petitioner Nos. 1 to 4. The court quashed the process issued against them and directed the Board to file a fresh complaint, disclosing all necessary particulars, which may fasten the criminal liability against them, if they so desire.

The court, however, did not quash the process issued against petitioner No. 5, who was the Managing Director of the company operating the sponge iron plant. The court observed that the complaint contained necessary averments against petitioner No. 5 under Section 40 of the Act. The court held that the complaint disclosed that petitioner No. 5 was responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the company and was in charge of the conduct of its business. The court held that petitioner No. 5 was vicariously liable for the acts of the company and therefore, the process issued against him deserved to be maintained.

In conclusion, the Chattisgarh High Court partially allowed the petition under Section 482 of Cr.PC, which challenged the issuance of summons against the petitioners by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Raipur in Complaint Case No. 3850/04. The court quashed the process issued against petitioner Nos. 1 to 4, as the complaint filed by the Board did not contain the necessary averments required under Section 40 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 against them. However, the court maintained the process issued against petitioner No. 5, as the complaint contained necessary averments against him under Section 40 of the Act. The court directed the Board to file a fresh complaint, disclosing all necessary particulars, which may fasten the criminal liability against the petitioners, if they so desire.
