The first court order pertains to a dispute over agricultural land in Sirasdevi, Beed district, Maharashtra. The deceased tenant, Zela Yada Wakte, was declared a protected tenant and had deposited the purchase price of the land. However, he later filed an application for ownership and possession, claiming that he was dispossessed by the landlord. The legal representatives of the landlord argued that the tenant had surrendered his tenancy rights and lost all rights due to non-compliance with directions to deposit the amount. The case went through various levels of appeal, with the learned Single Judge ultimately setting aside the orders of the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal and Additional Tahsildar, and restoring the order of the Deputy Collector (Land Reforms). The appellant challenged this decision in a Letters Patent Appeal. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The second court order discusses the jurisdictional error committed by a tribunal and how it can be corrected by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The court also explains that interlocutory orders passed by subordinate courts are open to challenge under certiorari and supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. The court concludes that the learned Single Judge exercised only supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India and therefore, a Letters Patent Appeal is not tenable. The court dismisses the appeal on the ground of maintainability.

The third court order dismisses a Letters Patent Appeal (LPA) under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, stating that it is not tenable due to Clause 15 of the Letters Patent. The court also upholds the decision of the learned Single Judge that surrender of tenancy rights by a tenant without proper enquiry and satisfaction of the Competent Authority is meaningless. The court further states that there cannot be outer limits to pay the price of the tenanted land. The court distinguishes two cases and dismisses the LPA, with parties to bear their respective costs of the appeal.
