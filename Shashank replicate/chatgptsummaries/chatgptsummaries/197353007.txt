In 1999, M/s Andritz Hydro Pvt. Ltd. filed a complaint against M/s Silical Metallurgic Limited and four individuals for dishonoring three cheques issued as part of a contract. The accused were charged with the commission of an offense punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The court order was issued in 2012, detailing the background of the case and the legal proceedings that took place.

The complainant presented evidence and witnesses in support of their case, while the accused denied the allegations and presented their own evidence. The accused claimed that there was an oral agreement not to present the cheques for encashment and that the complainant breached this agreement. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined the material on record before making a decision.

The court found that the complainant had successfully proven that three cheques were presented for encashment but were returned unpaid due to insufficient funds and stop payment. The court also found that a demand notice was sent to all five accused persons, and they were called upon to make payment against the three cheques within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice. The accused denied receiving the notice, but the court found their denial unconvincing.

The accused claimed that the cheques were not meant to be presented for encashment and were issued to satisfy foreign collaborators of the complainant. However, the court found that the cheques were issued to discharge a legally enforceable debt or liability and the accused failed to rebut the presumptions under sections 118(a) and 139 of Act 26 of 1881. The court also considered the admission of liability made by the accused and subsequent payments made to the complainant as evidence of the cheques being drawn to discharge the accused's liability.

The court found the accused no. 1 guilty of committing an offense punishable under section 138 of Act 26 of 1881 in respect of three cheques. The court also discussed the liability of other persons under section 141 of Act 26 of 1881 and cited the Hon'ble Supreme Court's ruling on the matter. The court determined that a person who can be made vicariously liable under sub-section (1) of Section 141 is a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company and in addition is also in charge of the business of the company.

The court summarized the position as follows: if a person is not responsible to the company for the conduct of its business, they cannot be held liable under subsection (1) of Section 141. The court then applied this law to the case at hand and found the accused no. 2 and 3 guilty of committing the offense charged against them. However, the court found that accused no. 4 cannot be held liable as he was not the General Manager of the accused no. 1, but only the Project Manager for the Hydro Electric Project.

The court acquitted accused no. 4 and accused no. 5. The accused no. 1, 2, and 3 were to be heard on the question of sentence on 02.04.2012. The court order also discussed the provisions of Section 138 and Section 141 of Act 26 of 1881, which pertain to the dishonour of cheques and offences committed by companies. The court found that the accused had failed to make payment on three cheques issued to the complainant. The defense argued that the accused were falsely implicated and that the court had no jurisdiction to proceed with the complaint. The defense also argued that the cheques were not drawn to discharge a legally enforceable debt or liability and that the accused no. 4 and 5 had no role in the day-to-day affairs of the accused no. 1.

The court discussed two preliminary points raised by the accused's counsel regarding the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the case and the correctness of the notice under section 251 of Cr.P.C. The court concluded that it had jurisdiction to proceed with the matter and that the notice of accusation had been framed correctly against each of the accused. The accusation against the accused was that the accused no. 1 had committed an offense punishable under section 138 of Act 26 of 1881, and the accused no. 2 to 5 were also liable for the commission of the said offense. The court also discussed the relevant sections of the law and previous court cases related to the matter.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a case where the accused dishonored three cheques issued as part of a contract. The complainant successfully proved that the cheques were presented for encashment but were returned unpaid due to insufficient funds and stop payment. The court found the accused no. 1 guilty of committing an offense punishable under section 138 of Act 26 of 1881 in respect of three cheques. The court also discussed the liability of other persons under section 141 of Act 26 of 1881 and acquitted accused no. 4 and accused no. 5. The accused no. 1, 2, and 3 were to be heard on the question of sentence on 02.04.2012.
