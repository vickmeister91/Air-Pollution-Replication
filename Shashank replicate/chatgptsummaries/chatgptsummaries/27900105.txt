The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the conservation and protection of the Asiatic lion, an endangered species found primarily in the Gir National Park in Gujarat, India. The court orders address the need for a second natural habitat for the Asiatic lion, the translocation of lions from Gir to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, and the legal framework surrounding the protection of wild animals and birds in India.

One court order discusses the need for a second natural habitat for the Asiatic lion for its long-term survival and to protect it from extinction. The Wildlife Institute of India had identified Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary as the most suitable site for reintroduction of the lions. The State of Madhya Pradesh had undertaken a rehabilitation package for the villagers settled in and near Kuno to push forward the scheme of relocation of Asiatic lions in Kuno. However, the State of Gujarat had raised objections to the proposal for translocation of lions from Gir National Park to Kuno. The National Board for Wildlife was directed to consider the objections and submit its recommendation to the court.

Another court order discusses the translocation of Asiatic lions from Gujarat to Kuno Palpur sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. The Chief Wildlife Warden of Gujarat argues that Kuno Palpur is not a suitable habitat for lions due to its climate and inadequate prey base. However, the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) unanimously recommends the translocation of lions to Kuno Palpur after conducting habitat feasibility studies. The committee also disputes Gujarat's claims about the unsuitability of Kuno Palpur's climate and prey base. The court orders the NBWL to have a fresh look at the issue and file a report, which ultimately recommends the translocation of lions to Kuno Palpur.

The court also discusses the reintroduction of Asiatic lions to Kuno-Palpur Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. The court finds that the Gujarat government's objections to the reintroduction are unfounded, and that the project has been approved by the National Board for Wildlife and the Wildlife Institute of India. The court also notes that the lion population in Gir is at risk due to limited genetic diversity and the possibility of disease outbreaks, making the reintroduction of lions to Kuno-Palpur Sanctuary necessary for the long-term survival of the species. The court orders the Gujarat government to cooperate with the project and allow the translocation of lions to Kuno-Palpur Sanctuary.

The court order also requires the initiation of a time-bound plan to identify and conduct status surveys of all endangered species, provide protection to their habitats, and identify suitable alternative homes for isolated populations. The court emphasizes the importance of an eco-centric approach to conservation and the need to prevent species from going extinct. The order also clarifies that no state, organization, or person can claim ownership or possession over wild animals in the forest, and that every nation has a duty to ensure their protection. The State of Gujarat's conservation program for the Asiatic lion is acknowledged, but the court emphasizes the need for a second habitat for the endangered species.

Another court order discusses the conservation of the Asiatic lion and the possibility of translocating them from Gujarat to Madhya Pradesh. The State Board for Wildlife in Gujarat and the State Government have taken an anthropocentric approach, considering the lions as "family members" and not agreeing to their translocation. However, the National Board for Wildlife has a duty to promote conservation and development of wildlife and has approved the re-introduction of Asiatic lions to Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh. The prey density at Kuno has been a point of contention, but studies show that it has far exceeded the estimated prey density. The court finds that the re-introduction of Asiatic lions to Kuno is justified for the preservation of the endangered species.

The court order also discusses the results of a survey conducted in Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary in June 2012 to estimate the prey base density. The survey was conducted by a team of independent scientists and officers, and the density of various prey species was estimated using the distance sampling on systematic line transect method. The population density of various prey species was calculated, and it was found that the biomass per sq/km in Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary was more than the biomass in Gir National Park. The State of Gujarat raised objections to the survey and sought a fresh survey on prey base. The court also discusses the decision of the Ministry of Environment and Forests to import African cheetahs to India and introduce them to Kuno, which was stayed by the court. The court finds the decision to introduce foreign cheetahs to Kuno arbitrary and illegal and a clear violation of the statutory requirements provided under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Finally, the court order states that the decision to introduce African cheetahs to Kuno and then Asiatic lions is illegal and violates the Wildlife Protection Act. The order quashes the decision to introduce African cheetahs but directs the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to urgently take steps to reintroduce Asiatic lions from Gir forests to Kuno. An expert committee consisting of officials from MoEF, Chief Wildlife Wardens of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, and technical experts, including Dr. Y.S. Jhala and Dr. Ravi Chellam, is to be constituted to assess the number of lions to be reintroduced. The order also highlights the need for an exclusive parliamentary legislation for the
