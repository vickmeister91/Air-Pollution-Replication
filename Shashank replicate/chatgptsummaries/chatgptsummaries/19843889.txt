The case in question involves a criminal petition filed by Sri H S Siddesh under section 482 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner sought to set aside an order passed by the learned Civil Judge & JMFC, Challakere in C.C.No.42/2016 dated 27.10.2016. The petitioner is facing trial before the court below on charges under sections 406, 408 and 420 of Indian Penal Code.

The petitioner had moved an application under section 91 of Cr.P.C. calling for certain documents, which was rejected by the Trial Court. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the accused had not disclosed his defence, and under such circumstances, there was no basis for the petitioner to call for the documents in question. However, the impugned order did not suffer from any error or infirmity, and hence, the criminal petition was dismissed.

Section 482 of Cr.P.C. empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In the present case, the petitioner had sought to set aside an order passed by the Trial Court rejecting his application under section 91 of Cr.P.C.

Section 91 of Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to a person in possession of any document or thing to produce it before the court or to give evidence relating to it. The purpose of this section is to enable the court to obtain evidence that is necessary for the just decision of a case.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought to call for certain documents under section 91 of Cr.P.C. However, the Trial Court had rejected his application on the ground that the accused had not disclosed his defence. The learned counsel for the petitioner had argued that the accused had not disclosed his defence, and hence, there was no basis for the petitioner to call for the documents in question.

The High Court, however, held that the impugned order did not suffer from any error or infirmity. The court observed that the Trial Court had considered the petitioner's application under section 91 of Cr.P.C. and had rejected it on the ground that the accused had not disclosed his defence. The court further observed that the Trial Court had considered the relevant provisions of law and had come to a correct conclusion.

The High Court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under section 482 of Cr.P.C. The court held that the petitioner had not shown that the impugned order was passed without jurisdiction or in violation of any principles of natural justice. The court further held that the petitioner had not shown that the impugned order would result in a failure of justice.

In conclusion, the High Court dismissed the criminal petition filed by Sri H S Siddesh under section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking to set aside the order passed by the learned Civil Judge & JMFC, Challakere in C.C.No.42/2016 dated 27.10.2016. The court held that the impugned order did not suffer from any error or infirmity, and that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under section 482 of Cr.P.C.
