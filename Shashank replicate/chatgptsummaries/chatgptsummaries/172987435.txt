The court order in question relates to a case where the prosecution had filed an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) seeking permission to produce certain documents during the stage of defence evidence. However, on the adjourned date, the documents were not produced, but were allowed to be produced on the next date. The prosecution's application was subsequently dismissed by the court.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that it considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also allows the court to require any person to produce such a document or thing, even if that person is not a party to the proceedings.

In this case, the prosecution had sought permission to produce certain documents during the stage of defence evidence. It is not clear from the available information what these documents were or why the prosecution had not produced them earlier in the proceedings. However, on the adjourned date, the documents were not produced, and the prosecution was allowed to produce them on the next date.

The defence, however, objected to the production of these documents, arguing that they had not been produced on the adjourned date as directed by the court. The defence also argued that the prosecution had not given any reasons for the delay in producing the documents.

The court, however, found nothing illegal in the prosecution's request to produce the documents on the next date. The court noted that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. allows for the production of documents at any stage of the proceedings, and that the prosecution had been allowed to produce the documents on the next date. The court also noted that the defence had not been prejudiced by the delay in the production of the documents.

Based on these findings, the court dismissed the prosecution's application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court's decision suggests that while the prosecution has the right to seek the production of documents under Section 91, it must do so in a timely and appropriate manner. The court also emphasized that the defence has the right to object to the production of such documents if they are not produced in accordance with the court's directions.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of following proper procedures and timelines in criminal proceedings. It also underscores the need for both the prosecution and the defence to be vigilant in protecting their respective rights and interests.
