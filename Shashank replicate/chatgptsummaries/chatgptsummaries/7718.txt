The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed an application challenging an order passed by a Judicial Magistrate allowing the recall of witnesses by respondents 2 and 3 in a criminal case. The High Court of Gujarat found that no sufficient ground or satisfaction was recorded by the Magistrate to recall the witnesses and that the order was devoid of merit and justification. The application was allowed, and the order was quashed and set aside.

The case in question pertained to a criminal complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the respondents under the Gujarat Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The respondents had allegedly discharged untreated effluent into a water body, causing pollution. The Board had filed the complaint in 2009, and the case had been pending for several years.

In 2016, the Judicial Magistrate had allowed the respondents to recall two witnesses who had already been examined by the Board. The Board had challenged this order before the High Court, contending that the Magistrate had not recorded any sufficient ground or satisfaction for allowing the recall of witnesses. The Board had also argued that the order was devoid of merit and justification.

The High Court agreed with the Board's contentions and quashed the Magistrate's order. The Court held that the Magistrate had not recorded any reasons for allowing the recall of witnesses and that the order was passed in a mechanical manner. The Court also observed that the respondents had not made any effort to explain why they needed to recall the witnesses.

The Court further noted that the Board had been negligent in pursuing the criminal case filed under the Gujarat Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Court observed that the case had been pending for several years, and no progress had been made. The Court also noted that no action had been taken against the officers of the Board for their negligence.

The Court held that the Board and its officers had a duty to pursue the criminal case diligently and that their failure to do so was a serious lapse. The Court directed the Board to take appropriate action against its officers for their negligence.

In conclusion, the High Court of Gujarat quashed the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate allowing the recall of witnesses by respondents 2 and 3 in a criminal case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board under the Gujarat Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Court found that no sufficient ground or satisfaction was recorded by the Magistrate to recall the witnesses and that the order was devoid of merit and justification. The Court also directed the Board to take appropriate action against its officers for their negligence in pursuing the criminal case.
