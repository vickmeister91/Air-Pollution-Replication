The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over unauthorized construction and the use of common areas in properties located in Greater Kailash, New Delhi. In the first case, Tina Arora, the owner of the entire terrace of a property, is entitled to construct a third floor. However, the defendants, who occupy different portions of the property, have raised unauthorized construction and covered common areas, depriving Arora of her rights. Arora applied for sanction of plans for the third floor, but the authorities were not taking steps and were raising objections. The defendants filed a contempt petition against Arora and her father, falsely alleging unauthorized construction. The court has ordered the defendants to remove the unauthorized construction and restore the common areas to Arora's possession. The court has also directed the authorities to consider Arora's application for sanction of plans for the third floor.

In the second case, the plaintiff, Tina Arora, complied with the directions of the defendants and deposited the required fee for reconsideration of her request for sanction of plans. However, there is extensive unauthorized construction in the property, and the defendants have no right to raise unauthorized construction or cover common areas beyond what has been permitted. The plaintiff has claimed relief of mandatory injunction for directing the defendants to remove the unauthorized constructions or to direct the defendants responsible for ensuring compliance with the sanction plan to do the same. The defendants have filed a written statement claiming that they have jointly regularized their constructions with the MCD upon payment of the regularization fee. The plaintiff's building plans have not been rejected on account of any act of the defendants. The plaintiff and her father caused damage to the roof of the second floor and refused to stop digging and construction without the defendants' no objection for the construction of the third floor. The defendants have sought relief of mandatory injunction and permanent injunction.

The third case involves a dispute between the plaintiff and defendants over unauthorized construction and the installation of a lift in a property in Greater Kailash-II, New Delhi. The defendants are accused of raising unauthorized constructions and covering common areas, including the area meant for installing the lift well. The plaintiff seeks a decree of mandatory injunction to remove the unauthorized constructions and a permanent prohibitory injunction to prevent interference with the installation of the lift. The defendants argue that they have regularized the deviations by paying the appropriate fee under self regularization scheme. The court has heard arguments from both parties and examined the evidence presented.

In the fourth case, the plaintiff wishes to raise construction on the terrace floor of a building, but the existing building may not be able to handle the additional structure. The defendants argue that they have regularized any deviations from the building plan and that the plaintiff has no right to install a lift. The court determines that the plaintiff's suit is not barred by the lack of a statutory notice and that the plaintiff's father can testify on her behalf. The court also discusses various provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act related to building construction and sanctions. Ultimately, the court must determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to a mandatory injunction to remove unauthorized construction and a permanent injunction to prevent interference with the installation of a lift.

In the fifth case, the court order states that the Civil Court cannot entertain any suit in respect of an order or notice appealable under section 347B. The plaintiff attempted to seek something indirectly that could not have been sought directly, and the relief sought is without any cause of action. The court dismissed the suit of the plaintiff and no order was given as to cost. The file was consigned to the Record Room.

In all of these cases, the court has had to determine whether the defendants have raised unauthorized construction and covered common areas beyond what has been permitted, and whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief in the form of mandatory injunctions and permanent prohibitory injunctions. The court has also had to consider various provisions of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act related to building construction and sanctions. Ultimately, the court has had to balance the rights of the plaintiff and defendants and determine the appropriate course of action to ensure that the property is used in accordance with the law and the rights of all parties are protected.
