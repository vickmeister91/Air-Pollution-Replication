The court order in question pertains to two applications filed by the directors of a company seeking to quash process under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The complaint was filed against them for being in charge and responsible for the business of the company. The directors had argued that they were not responsible for the issuance of the cheque in question and that they had no knowledge of the same. They had also contended that the complaint was filed with a mala fide intention to harass them.

The court, however, held that the burden of proving the defense lies on the accused and can only be done at the time of the trial. The court observed that the directors had not produced any evidence to support their defense and that their contentions were mere assertions. The court also noted that the complaint had been filed after due notice and that the directors had failed to appear before the trial court despite being summoned.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the applications and ordered the parties to appear before the trial court on a specified date. The court also directed the trial court to proceed with the matter in accordance with the law and to dispose of the same expeditiously.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the burden of proving the defense lies on the accused and that mere assertions are not sufficient to discharge this burden. The order also highlights the importance of appearing before the trial court and cooperating with the legal process. Failure to do so can result in adverse consequences, as seen in this case.

It is important to note that Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the dishonor of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The section provides for criminal liability for the drawer of the cheque, as well as for any person who is in charge and responsible for the business of the drawer. This includes directors of a company who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with legal processes and cooperating with the authorities. It also underscores the need for accused persons to produce evidence to support their defense and to discharge the burden of proof that lies on them. The order is a significant development in the jurisprudence surrounding Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and is likely to have implications for future cases involving similar issues.
