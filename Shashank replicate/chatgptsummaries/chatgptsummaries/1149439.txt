The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently issued a court order dismissing two revision petitions that challenged an order to remove the seal from a stone crushing unit belonging to the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 and restore it to its position as of August 18, 1999. The defendant-petitioner, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, had directed the closure of the unit under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, on August 18, 1999, without waiting for the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 to comply with the directions recorded in the show cause notice dated August 12, 1999. 

The court found the defendant-petitioner's action to be arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. The right of the defendant-petitioner to examine the application of the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 afresh by giving sufficient time to comply with the directions was kept intact. The court order dismisses revision petitions and states that the defendant-petitioner has the right to issue fresh orders and proceed in accordance with the law. The order does not express an opinion on the merits of the civil suits.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process and natural justice principles while taking action against violators of environmental laws. The defendant-petitioner's action of closing down the stone crushing unit without giving sufficient time to the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 to comply with the directions recorded in the show cause notice was found to be arbitrary and against the principles of natural justice. The court order emphasizes the need for authorities to follow due process and give sufficient time to violators to comply with the directions before taking any punitive action.

The court order also highlights the importance of environmental laws and the role of pollution control boards in enforcing them. The defendant-petitioner, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, had directed the closure of the stone crushing unit under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. This section empowers pollution control boards to take punitive action against violators of environmental laws. However, the court order emphasizes that such action must be taken in accordance with due process and natural justice principles.

The court order also has implications for other cases where environmental laws have been violated. It emphasizes the need for authorities to follow due process and natural justice principles while taking action against violators. This is particularly important in cases where the violator is a small business or individual who may not have the resources to fight legal battles. The court order ensures that such individuals are not unfairly targeted and that their rights are protected.

In conclusion, the court order dismissing two revision petitions challenging an order to remove the seal from a stone crushing unit belonging to the plaintiff-respondent No. 1 and restore it to its position as of August 18, 1999, highlights the importance of following due process and natural justice principles while taking action against violators of environmental laws. The order emphasizes the need for authorities to give sufficient time to violators to comply with the directions before taking any punitive action. It also has implications for other cases where environmental laws have been violated and ensures that the rights of small businesses and individuals are protected.
