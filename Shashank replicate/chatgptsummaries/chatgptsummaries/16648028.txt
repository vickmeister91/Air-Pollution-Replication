The Madras High Court recently passed a significant order in a Habeas Corpus petition filed by Mangaleswari, the wife of a man who had been detained under Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982 for being a "Forest Offender". The order of detention was passed by the second respondent in Cr.M.P.No.20/F.O./2013, dated 31.07.2013. The petitioner had challenged the order of detention on several grounds, including the non-furnishing of a document relied on by the Detaining Authority.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, quashed the detention order and ordered the release of the detenu, unless his custody was required in connection with any other case. The court observed that the Detaining Authority had failed to furnish a document relied on by him while passing the detention order. The court held that the non-furnishing of the document had resulted in a violation of the principles of natural justice and had rendered the detention order illegal.

The court also observed that the Detaining Authority had not considered the relevant materials while passing the detention order. The court held that the Detaining Authority had relied on irrelevant materials while passing the detention order and had not considered the relevant materials. The court held that the detention order was passed without any application of mind and was therefore illegal.

The court further observed that the Detaining Authority had not given any reasons for the detention order. The court held that the Detaining Authority had not given any reasons for the detention order and had not communicated the grounds of detention to the detenu. The court held that the detention order was therefore illegal and violative of the principles of natural justice.

The court also observed that the Detaining Authority had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act while passing the detention order. The court held that the Detaining Authority had not followed the procedure prescribed under the Act and had not given the detenu an opportunity to make a representation against the detention order. The court held that the detention order was therefore illegal and violative of the principles of natural justice.

The court, therefore, quashed the detention order and ordered the release of the detenu, unless his custody was required in connection with any other case. The court held that the detenu was entitled to compensation for the illegal detention and directed the State to pay a sum of Rs. 50,000 as compensation to the detenu.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the principles of natural justice and the need for Detaining Authorities to follow the procedure prescribed under the Act while passing detention orders. The court's order also highlights the need for Detaining Authorities to consider the relevant materials while passing detention orders and to communicate the grounds of detention to the detenu. The court's order is a reminder that the power to detain a person is a serious power and must be exercised with utmost care and caution.
