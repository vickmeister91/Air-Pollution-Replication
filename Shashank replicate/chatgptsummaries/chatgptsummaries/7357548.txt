The court order pertains to the case of Suraj @ Guddu, who has been in custody since January 24, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant has sought bail, citing his reputation and the need for sufficient time for the disposal of the case. The state opposes the application, stating that the applicant may escape if granted bail. The court allows the application with the condition that the applicant furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and two surety bonds of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it becomes ineffective.

The case of Suraj @ Guddu has been ongoing since January 24, 2015, when he was taken into custody for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant has been seeking bail, citing his reputation and the need for sufficient time for the disposal of the case. The state, however, opposes the application, stating that the applicant may escape if granted bail.

After considering the arguments put forth by both parties, the court has allowed the application for bail. However, the court has imposed certain conditions that must be met by the applicant. The applicant must furnish a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 and two surety bonds of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. These conditions are in place to ensure that the applicant does not flee and remains present for the duration of the trial.

The court order is effective until the end of the trial. However, if the applicant jumps bail, the order becomes ineffective. This is a standard condition that is imposed in cases where bail is granted. It serves as a deterrent to prevent the applicant from fleeing and ensures that they remain present for the duration of the trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicant is based on several factors. The applicant has cited his reputation and the need for sufficient time for the disposal of the case as reasons for seeking bail. The court has taken these factors into consideration and has deemed them to be valid reasons for granting bail.

However, the state has opposed the application, stating that the applicant may escape if granted bail. This is a valid concern, and the court has taken steps to address it by imposing conditions on the applicant. The conditions are designed to ensure that the applicant remains present for the duration of the trial and does not flee.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Suraj @ Guddu, who has been in custody since January 24, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has imposed certain conditions on the applicant to ensure that he remains present for the duration of the trial. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it becomes ineffective. The court's decision to grant bail is based on several factors, including the applicant's reputation and the need for sufficient time for the disposal of the case. The state has opposed the application, citing concerns that the applicant may escape if granted bail. However, the court has taken steps to address these concerns by imposing conditions on the applicant.
