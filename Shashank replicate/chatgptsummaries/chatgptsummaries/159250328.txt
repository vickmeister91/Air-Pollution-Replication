The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has heard several cases related to the Ministry of Environment and Forest's decision-making process for granting Environmental Clearance to certain projects. The petitioners argued that the decision-making process was complex and required consideration of several factors, including social impacts, and relied on the contribution of various experts in the field of environment. The Central Government had framed Environment Clearance Regulations in 2006, which stipulated four stages in the process of obtaining Environmental Clearance, including screening, scoping, public consultation, and appraisal of the project. The composition of the sector/project-specific Expert Appraisal Committees and State Expert Appraisal Committees was detailed in Appendix VI to the Notification of 2006.

One of the court orders discussed the composition and eligibility criteria for the sector/project-specific Environmental Appraisal Committees (EAC) and State Environmental Appraisal Committees (SEAC) for granting Environmental Clearance to projects. The court notes that the recommendations made by these committees are critical in the clearance process and emphasizes the importance of having well-qualified and experienced members on these committees. The court also highlights the variation in eligibility criteria across different notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and the potential impact on environmental protection. The court order suggests that the MoEF has failed to appreciate the significance of the appraisal process.

Another court order discussed a petition filed against the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) regarding the eligibility criteria for members of the Environmental Appraisal Committee (EAC). The petitioner argues that the MoEF has been appointing individuals without the necessary expertise, leading to conflicts of interest and prejudicing the purpose of environmental clearance. The court considers whether it has the power to review the validity of the Notification of 2006, which prescribes the eligibility criteria for EAC members. The court also considers whether the petitioner can invoke the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act and whether the present application is maintainable. The court ultimately decides to defer the decision on these issues and focus on the eligibility criteria for EAC members.

The court order also discusses the power of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to exercise limited judicial review as a supplement to higher courts. The order also addresses the eligibility criteria for the Chairperson and members of the EAC/SEAC Committee and the validity of the Notification issued under Environment Clearance Regulations, 2006. The court notes that the challenge to paragraph 4 of Appendix VI is no longer valid as it was omitted in 2007, but the expression 'public administration or management' in paragraph 2 is still considered an offending requirement by the applicants.

The court order states that individuals with experience only in administrative and management fields cannot be appointed as members of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) for Environmental Clearance. The EAC is expected to examine the environmental impact assessment of a project and its surroundings, and therefore, specialized individuals with experience in the field of environment should be appointed. The court also mentions that the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) cannot violate statutory provisions or act against the spirit of legislation. The court further discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under Section 14 of the NGT Act, which outlines the Tribunal's jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) under Sections 14 and 15 of the NGT Act. The NGT has the power to try civil cases related to the environment and the enforcement of legal rights related to the environment. The definition of "substantial question relating to environment" under Section 2(m) of the NGT Act is inclusive and should be interpreted liberally. The court also emphasizes that the right to a clean and decent environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The case in question involves the establishment of a sewage treatment plant that could potentially harm the environment and public health, and falls within the jurisdiction of the NGT.

The court order states that the protection of the environment and ecology is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The National Green Tribunal has wide jurisdiction over cases related to the environment and laws related to it, including cases with indirect adverse impacts. The Tribunal has been established to settle disputes involving multi-disciplinary issues relating to the environment and to provide relief and compensation for damages to persons and property. The court emphasizes the need for a purposive interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act to achieve its objectives. The Act has an overriding effect and does not oust the jurisdiction of superior courts under the Constitution of India. However, the court recommends transferring proceedings under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to the National Green Tribunal for the settlement of disputes relating to the environment.

The court order states that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has jurisdiction over civil cases that raise substantial questions relating to the environment and arise from the implementation of Acts specified in Schedule I of the NGT Act. The term "implementation" should be understood in its wider perspective and connotation, and there should be a direct or indirect nexus with the environment. The interpretation should further the cause of effective implementation of the provisions of the Scheduled Acts. The court also mentions the need to constitute appropriate expert committees.

The court order states that the constitution of appropriate expert committees is necessary for effective prevention and control of pollution. The expressions 'environment' and 'substantial question relating to environment' have
