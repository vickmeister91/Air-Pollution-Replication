In a recent court order, the petitioner, Balvinder Jeet Singh, approached the court to quash an FIR registered against him for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner's counsel argued that the case was false and fabricated, and the petitioner was not present at the time of recovery. However, the court found that the trophy recovered from the petitioner's house was of a schedule-I animal, Chinkara, as per FSL and DNA examination. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the accused could raise their objections/defence before the trial court at the appropriate stage.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants, and it also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas.

In this case, the petitioner was accused of violating the Act by possessing a trophy of a schedule-I animal, Chinkara, which is a protected species under the Act. The petitioner's counsel argued that the case was false and fabricated, and the petitioner was not present at the time of recovery. However, the court found that the trophy recovered from the petitioner's house was of a schedule-I animal, Chinkara, as per FSL and DNA examination.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition and allow the accused to raise their objections/defence before the trial court at the appropriate stage is in line with the principles of natural justice. The accused has the right to defend themselves and present their case before the court, and the court's decision to allow them to do so is a fair and just one.
