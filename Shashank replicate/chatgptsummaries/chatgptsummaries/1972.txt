The first court order pertains to a case where a decree-holder filed a suit for recovery of arrears of rent against a tenure-holder. The estate of the proprietor and the tenure of the tenure-holder vested in the State of Bihar under the Bihar Land Reforms Act. The judgment-debtor objected to the execution of the decree, stating that it was invalid. The Division Bench referred the case to a Full Bench to decide whether Section 14 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act applies to rent or rent decree charged upon a tenure under the provisions of Section 60 of the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act.

The Full Bench of the court held that the charge created under Section 65 of the Bihar Tenancy Act or Section 60 of the Tenancy Act is not such a charge that could be destroyed because of Section 4(a) of the Reforms Act. The court also held that the proprietor was not required in law to go to the Claims Officer under Section 14 of the Reforms Act for recovery of the arrears of rent. This means that the landlord can recover arrears of rent from the tenant without having to go through the Claims Officer under Section 14 of the Reforms Act.

The second court order discusses the interpretation of Section 65 of the Bengal Tenancy Act and the Bihar Tenancy Act, which gives landlords the right to bring a tenure or holding to sale in order to recover arrears of rent. The court clarifies that this right only exists as long as the relationship of landlord and tenant exists, and that an ex-landlord who has sold their interest in the property has no such right.

The court also discusses the meaning of the term "charge" in relation to Section 4(d) and Section 14 of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, and concludes that these provisions do not apply to rent or rent decrees charged upon a tenure under the provisions of Section 60 of the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act. This means that the landlord can recover arrears of rent from the tenant without having to go through the Claims Officer under Section 14 of the Reforms Act.

The case is sent back to the Division Bench for further consideration. This means that the Division Bench will have to consider the implications of the court's decision on the case and make a final ruling based on the court's interpretation of the law.

Overall, these court orders provide important clarifications on the interpretation of various provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act and the Chota Nagpur Tenancy Act. Landlords can now recover arrears of rent from tenants without having to go through the Claims Officer under Section 14 of the Reforms Act. However, the right to bring a tenure or holding to sale in order to recover arrears of rent only exists as long as the relationship of landlord and tenant exists. Ex-landlords who have sold their interest in the property have no such right.
