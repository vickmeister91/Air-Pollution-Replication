The writ petition filed by M/s. Tata Mines & Minerals sought a direction to the State of Karnataka to issue notifications under Sections 5 and 8 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, granting the mining lease in favor of the petitioner. The petitioner argued that they had applied for a mining lease in 2013 and had completed all the necessary formalities. However, the State of Karnataka had not issued the necessary notifications, causing a delay in the grant of the mining lease.

The court, in response to the writ petition, directed the Secretary (Mines), Department of Commerce and Industries, Government of Karnataka, to consider the request of the writ petitioner for issuing the notification within six weeks. This direction was given in light of the fact that the petitioner had completed all the necessary formalities and had been waiting for the grant of the mining lease for a considerable period of time.

Additionally, the court directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the application of the writ petitioner for approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This direction was given as the petitioner had also applied for approval under this Act, which is necessary for the grant of a mining lease in forest areas. The court's direction to consider the application was given in light of the fact that the petitioner had completed all the necessary formalities and had been waiting for the grant of the mining lease for a considerable period of time.

It is important to note that no order was made as to costs in this case. This means that the petitioner will not be required to pay any costs to the State of Karnataka or any other party involved in the case. This is a significant relief for the petitioner as the costs of litigation can be substantial.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Karnataka High Court in response to the writ petition filed by M/s. Tata Mines & Minerals is a significant development in the case. The court's direction to the Secretary (Mines), Department of Commerce and Industries, Government of Karnataka, to consider the request of the writ petitioner for issuing the notification within six weeks and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the application of the writ petitioner for approval under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is likely to expedite the grant of the mining lease. The fact that no order was made as to costs is also a significant relief for the petitioner. Overall, this court order is a positive development for the petitioner and is likely to have a significant impact on the case.
