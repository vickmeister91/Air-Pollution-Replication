The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Tulsiram Nandaji Rat in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under the Prohibition Act. The applicant's lawyer argued that he should be granted bail with suitable conditions, while the state's lawyer opposed it. After considering the facts of the case, the court granted bail to the applicant on a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 with certain conditions, including surrendering his passport and marking his presence at the police station every month. The court also warned that if the applicant breaches any of the conditions, appropriate action will be taken.

The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain areas. It is a strict law that is enforced rigorously, and violations can result in severe penalties. In this case, Tulsiram Nandaji Rat was accused of violating the Prohibition Act, and an FIR was registered against him. He then filed a bail application, seeking release from custody until his trial.

During the hearing of the bail application, the applicant's lawyer argued that his client should be granted bail with suitable conditions. He argued that the applicant was not a flight risk and that he had cooperated with the investigation. He also argued that the offence in question was not a serious one and that his client had no criminal record. The state's lawyer, on the other hand, opposed the bail application, arguing that the offence was a serious one and that the applicant was likely to abscond if released on bail.

After considering the arguments of both sides, the court granted bail to the applicant on a personal bond of Rs. 10,000. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicant, including surrendering his passport and marking his presence at the police station every month. These conditions were imposed to ensure that the applicant did not abscond and that he cooperated with the investigation. The court also warned the applicant that if he breached any of the conditions, appropriate action would be taken against him.

The granting of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and it is based on the facts and circumstances of each case. In this case, the court considered the nature of the offence, the applicant's criminal record, and the likelihood of him absconding if released on bail. Based on these factors, the court granted bail to the applicant with suitable conditions.

In conclusion, the court order in question relates to a bail application filed by Tulsiram Nandaji Rat in connection with an FIR registered against him for offences under the Prohibition Act. The court granted bail to the applicant on a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 with certain conditions, including surrendering his passport and marking his presence at the police station every month.
