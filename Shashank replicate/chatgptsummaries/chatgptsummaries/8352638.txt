Dr. (Mrs.) Neena V. Patel had filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Court of IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Jabalpur in Complaint Case No.281/2012 dated 9.10.2015. The order had rejected four applications moved by the Special Public Prosecutor under Section 91 read with Section 311 of Cr.P.C. for calling certain documents from the Banks and the Income Tax Department. The learned counsel for the petitioners stated that the order was bad in law and on facts on account of mis-appreciation of the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in State of Orissa Vs. Devendra Nath Padhi, 2005(1) SCC 568.

The Supreme Court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, set aside the impugned order dated 9.10.2015 and remanded the case to the trial Court requesting it to pass an order on merits one way or the other relating to those documents mentioned in the prayer clause of the four applications.

Devendra Nath Padhi, 2005(1) SCC 568. The Court observed that the trial Court had not considered the relevance and importance of the documents sought to be summoned and had rejected the applications in a mechanical manner.
