The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petition sought to quash an award passed in pursuance of land acquisition proceedings for the construction of a Common Effluent Treatment Plant. The petitioners were industrialists and factory owners who were obstructing the implementation of the directions given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India for public welfare in Delhi. The court found that the petitioners' actions were detrimental to the public interest and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the construction of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant was necessary for the protection of the environment and the health of the people living in the area. The court noted that the petitioners had been given ample opportunity to comply with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, but they had failed to do so. The court found that the petitioners' actions were obstructing the implementation of the directions given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and were therefore against the public interest.

In light of these findings, the court ordered the sealing and closure of all polluting factories and industries in the area until the Common Effluent Treatment Plant becomes operational. The court directed the petitioners to deposit the entire amount due with the Registrar General, High Court of Delhi, within four weeks, failing which it would be recovered as land revenue. The court also ordered the petitioners to pay Rs. 2 lacs as costs in favor of Respondent No. 4 (L&B) and Respondent No. 5 (LAC).
