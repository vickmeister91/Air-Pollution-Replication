The court order in question relates to an application made by Than Singh, who challenged the rejection of his request to include his call details in the charge-sheet to establish his location at the time of the incident. The court ruled that the prosecution is only obliged to file documents on which it places reliance and the accused cannot insist on the inclusion of documents made available by him. The court also stated that mobile location alone cannot prove the accused's absence from the place of the incident and dismissed the application.

The case in question involves Than Singh, who was accused of committing a crime at a particular location. Singh had requested that his call details be included in the charge-sheet to establish his location at the time of the incident. However, the prosecution rejected this request, stating that it was not obliged to include documents made available by the accused.

Singh then filed an application challenging the rejection of his request. He argued that his call details were crucial to establishing his location at the time of the incident and that their exclusion from the charge-sheet would be prejudicial to his case.

The court, however, dismissed Singh's application, stating that the prosecution is only obliged to file documents on which it places reliance. The court held that the accused cannot insist on the inclusion of documents made available by him. In other words, the prosecution has the discretion to decide which documents to include in the charge-sheet and which to exclude.

The court also noted that mobile location alone cannot prove the accused's absence from the place of the incident. This is an important point to consider, as mobile location data is often used as evidence in criminal cases. The court's ruling suggests that mobile location data should not be relied upon as the sole piece of evidence to establish an accused's location at the time of the incident.

Overall, the court's order highlights the importance of the prosecution's discretion in deciding which documents to include in the charge-sheet. It also emphasizes the need for multiple pieces of evidence to establish an accused's location at the time of the incident, rather than relying solely on mobile location data.
