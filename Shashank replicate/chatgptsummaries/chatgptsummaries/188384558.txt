The Kerala High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to two writ petitions filed by Paragon Steels Private Limited and S.M.M. Steel Re-Rolling Mills Private Limited, and two permanent residents of Kanjikode in Palakkad District. The petitions challenged the integrated consents issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to the petitioners, which restricted the operation of their furnaces from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. due to alleged pollution caused by the companies. The court heard and disposed of both petitions together.

The first case involved M/s. Paragon Steels Private Limited and M/s. S.M.M Steel Re-Rolling Mills Private Limited, who are running steel re-rolling mills in the Industrial Development Area, Kanjikode in Palakkad District. They filed a petition to set aside the condition in the integrated consent that restrains the operation of the furnace of the units from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The second case involved additional respondents 3 and 4 who filed a petition stating that the two industrial units of the petitioners had been established in violation of the distance criteria and the industries were causing heavy air and sound pollution. The court considered the arguments of both parties and gave a detailed order.

The court order stated that the units in question were situated in an Industrial Development Area and that the night-time restriction imposed by the Pollution Control Board was legal. The Pollution Control Board had the authority to direct that an industry not satisfying the air quality standards prescribed for the night-time shall not function during night-time. The court also stated that no industrial unit could claim that it needed to comply only with the parameters prescribed for industrial areas, though the noise or emissions from the industry resulted in pollution of the nearby residential area violating the parameters prescribed for the residential area. The court also mentioned that the petitioners faced a genuine issue as the night-time power tariff was almost fifty percent less than the day-time tariff and the night-time restriction imposed by the Pollution Control Board would not only adversely affect productivity but also financial viability, if not profitability.

The court order directed the respondent to consider applications in accordance with the law and investigate complaints made by additional respondents regarding persistent violation of conditions in the integrated consent issued by the Board. The order also disposed of the writ petitions with the given directions. The appendix included exhibits submitted by both the petitioner and respondent.

The court order listed various exhibits, including photocopies of registration and consent to operate documents issued by the 1st and 2nd respondents to the 3rd and 4th respondents under hazardous waste management rules. It also included communication, show cause notices, and judgments related to the case.

In summary, the court order pertained to two writ petitions challenging the integrated consents issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to Paragon Steels Private Limited and S.M.M. Steel Re-Rolling Mills Private Limited. The court upheld the night-time restriction imposed by the Pollution Control Board and directed the respondent to investigate complaints made by additional respondents regarding persistent violation of conditions in the integrated consent issued by the Board. The court also disposed of the writ petitions with the given directions and listed various exhibits related to the case.
