The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) was recently challenged in court by Prof. I. Elangovan, who filed two petitions questioning the validity of two notifications/advertisements issued by the TNPSC. The petitioner argued that the TNPSC did not follow the rule of 3% reservation as provided under Section 33 of The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (PWD Act) for the recruitment to the posts advertised. The petitioner argued that the impugned notifications/advertisements denying legitimate reservation to persons with disabilities are contrary to the statutory guarantee under Section 33 of the Act.

The respondents argued that the rule of reservation of appointments shall apply only department/unit wise, and where the vacancies furnished by the departments/units happen to be below 100 marks, no reservation in favour of physically handicapped persons is permissible. However, the court held that the appropriate Government is statutorily enjoined to appoint in every establishment such percentage of vacancies not less than 3% for persons with disabilities, of which 1% each shall be reserved for three categories mentioned in Section 33 of the Act.

The court order states that the appropriate government is required to reserve not less than 3% of vacancies for persons with disabilities in every establishment, including each department of the government. The Tamil Nadu State and Subordinate Service Rules provide for reservation in the state and subordinate services in favor of persons with disabilities, but the provisions of the Act shall prevail over these rules. The Act has been enacted to implement the proclamation adopted at Beijing in 1992 for providing full participation and equality of people with disabilities in the Asian and Pacific regions.

The court directed the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission to fill up the vacancies exclusively by appointing eligible disabled candidates. This decision is a significant step towards ensuring that persons with disabilities are not discriminated against in the recruitment process. It is essential to provide equal opportunities to all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities, to ensure that they can contribute to society and lead fulfilling lives.

The court's decision is in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which recognizes the right of persons with disabilities to work on an equal basis with others. The Convention also calls for the elimination of discrimination against persons with disabilities in all matters relating to employment, including recruitment, hiring, and promotion.

The court's decision is a positive step towards creating a more inclusive society that values diversity and recognizes the contributions of all individuals. It is essential to continue to work towards creating a society that is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their physical abilities, to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.
