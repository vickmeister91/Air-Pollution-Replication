The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Orissa, India heard two appeals from the Executive Engineer of the Central Supply Electrical Division and the State Pollution Control Board.

The Commission found that an order in the form of an injunction could not be passed in the face of the statutory bar contained in the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and set aside the impugned order, dismissing the complaint and allowing both appeals.
