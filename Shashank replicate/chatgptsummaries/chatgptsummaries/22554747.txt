The court heard two writ petitions filed by companies seeking environmental clearance for quarrying leases. The companies had submitted applications for environmental clearance, which were accepted by the first respondent. The District Environmental Expert Appraisal Committee and the District Environmental Impact Assessment Authority recommended environmental clearance, but the first respondent had not communicated clearance to the petitioners. The court ordered the first respondent to issue environmental clearance to the petitioners based on the recommendations of the statutory authorities.

In another court order, the entitlement of the petitioner to receive environmental clearance under Notification 2006 was discussed. The court noted that the petitioner had not received clearance and was entitled to a deemed license as per the notification. The court also considered the counter affidavit filed by the respondents and the report of the Tahsildar, which stated that the land proposed for the project was assigned for agricultural and residential purposes. The District Environmental Impact Assessment Authority rejected the application for clearance on this basis. The court also noted that the petitioner had produced Pattas to justify their entitlement to conduct quarrying operations. The court ultimately concluded that the petitioner was entitled to a deemed license as per the notification.

The third court order stated that unless the regulatory authority communicates any adverse order within 105 days of receiving a complete application with requisite documents, the applicant is entitled to a deemed license in accordance with the Notification, 2006. The petitioners were entitled to a deemed license and the 1st respondent was directed to issue necessary orders in accordance with the deemed environmental clearance within a month from the date of receipt of a copy of the judgment. However, the findings and directions would not stand in the way of other authorities scrutinizing the applications in accordance with the respective provisions of the various statutes. The writ petitions were allowed to this extent.

In the fourth court order, the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority in Kerala granted permission to M/S Three Star Granites in Thrissur, valid until November 28, 2022. The court order included several true copies of pattas granted to the predecessors of M/S Three Star Granites, as well as exhibits from the respondent, including a copy of the judgment of the Hon'ble High Court in Haridas R vs. State of Kerala.
