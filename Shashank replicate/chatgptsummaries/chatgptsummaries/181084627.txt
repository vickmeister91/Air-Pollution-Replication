The case in question involves an application filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) to challenge the order of the learned Special Judge, NDPS Act, Jaora, District Ratlam. The petitioner had previously filed an application under Section 91, 92 of Cr.P.C. and under Section 65 of the Information Technology (IT) Act, requesting the call details of certain mobile numbers to prove the location of the raiding police officials at the time of the incident. However, the trial judge dismissed the application.

The petitioner then approached the High Court, seeking relief. The High Court partially allowed the application, directing the trial judge to send an intimation to the concerning company to preserve the record of the calls made by and on the mentioned mobile numbers and their locations at the relevant point of time.

The case raises important questions about the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials and the role of technology in the justice system. The petitioner's request for call details is a common tactic used by defense lawyers to establish the whereabouts of police officials during a raid or arrest. However, the admissibility of such evidence is often contested, as it can be difficult to establish the authenticity and accuracy of call records.

In this case, the trial judge dismissed the application on the grounds that the call details were not relevant to the case. However, the High Court partially allowed the application, recognizing the potential importance of the call records in establishing the location of the police officials at the time of the incident.

The High Court's decision to direct the trial judge to send an intimation to the concerning company to preserve the call records is significant, as it highlights the importance of preserving digital evidence in criminal cases. With the increasing use of technology in everyday life, digital evidence is becoming more and more important in criminal trials. However, the admissibility of such evidence is often contested, and there is a need for clear guidelines and procedures for the collection, preservation, and presentation of digital evidence in court.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of technology in the justice system and the need for clear guidelines and procedures for the collection and presentation of digital evidence in criminal trials. The High Court's decision to partially allow the petitioner's application and direct the trial judge to preserve the call records is a step in the right direction towards ensuring that justice is served in an increasingly digital world.
