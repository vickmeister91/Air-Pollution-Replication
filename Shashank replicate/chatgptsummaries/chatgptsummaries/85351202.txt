The Orissa High Court recently heard six Criminal Revision petitions challenging an order passed by the Special Judge (Vigilance), Keonjhar in VGR Case No. 19 of 2011. The petitioners sought discharge from offences under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act, Indian Penal Code, Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957, Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988. The case pertains to the grant of a mining lease for Manganese and Iron Ore to Late Banshidhar Patnaik, the father of one of the accused-petitioners, Jitendranath Patnaik. The lease was surrendered in respect of Manganese in 1967, but continued for Iron Ore. The accused allegedly applied for working permission pending renewal of the mining lease, which was granted for six months and extended from time to time until 26.12.1994 without any approval by the Ministry of Environment.

The court order pertains to a case of illegal mining activities carried out by accused Jitendranath Patnaik and others, causing a loss of Rs. 130.39 crores to the government. The accused have challenged the order of cognizance taken by the Vigilance Judge, stating that the complaint was not lodged by a competent authority as per the mandate in Section 22 of the MMDR Act and Schedule-I of the OMTPS Rules. The court examines the relevant provisions and notifications and concludes that the Vigilance Officials have been duly empowered and authorized to conduct enquiry and investigation in respect of all such offences.

The court order discusses a notification issued by the government in 2010, which authorizes the Vigilance Police to investigate and take legal action against illegal mining activities in the state, including offenses under various Acts and Rules. The court concludes that the complaint filed by the Vigilance Police against the petitioners is maintainable, as they have been specifically authorized to conduct the investigation and take legal action. The court also notes that the argument that lifting minerals even by violating provisions does not amount to theft under the Indian Penal Code is not convincing, as the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that such actions can be punished under Sections 378 and 379 of the IPC.

The court order states that anyone who extracts sand, gravel, or other minerals from government land without consent and with the intent to remove them dishonestly is committing theft and can be punished under Sections 378 and 379 of the Penal Code. The court also clarifies that contravening the terms and conditions of a mining lease or violating Section 4 of the MMDR Act is an offense punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act, while theft of minerals is a distinct offense under the IPC. The court overrules the view taken by different high courts and directs magistrates to proceed accordingly. The court also rejects the argument that retirement from service can bar criminal prosecution and that the absence of all legal heirs of a lessee makes prosecution against one legal heir alone not maintainable. The court finds the criminal revisions devoid of merit and dismisses them.

In summary, the Orissa High Court heard six Criminal Revision petitions challenging an order passed by the Special Judge (Vigilance), Keonjhar in VGR Case No. 19 of 2011.
