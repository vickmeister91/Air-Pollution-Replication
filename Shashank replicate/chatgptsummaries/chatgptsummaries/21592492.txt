The National Green Tribunal heard three appeals against the Ministry of Environment and Forests regarding the power to issue directions for environmental protection. The Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986, provides for the Central Government to issue directions and prohibitions on industries and processes in different areas. The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, specify the nature of action to be taken and the time within which it shall be complied with by the person, officer, or authority to whom such direction is given. The person, officer, or authority to whom any direction is sought to be issued shall be served with a copy of the proposed direction and shall be given an opportunity of not less than fifteen days from the date of service of a notice to file with an officer designated in this behalf the objections, if any, to the issue of the proposed direction.

The court order outlines the rules and procedures for the Central Government to issue directions and prohibitions on industries and processes in different areas. Rule 4 deals with general directions and the procedure for compliance, while Rule 5 specifically addresses the location of industries and processes. The rules provide for an opportunity for affected parties to file objections and for the Central Government to consider them before issuing a direction. However, there are exceptions to the requirement for a hearing in certain situations, such as when the person has already been heard earlier. Rule 5(4) allows the Central Government to issue an order without complying with the procedure if it is in the public interest to do so.

The court order discusses the power of the Central Government to issue directions regarding the prohibition or restriction of industries, processes, and operations in certain areas. The order also mentions an environmental clearance order that was kept in abeyance for 139 mining cases in Goa, pending further scrutiny. Three private stakeholders appealed the order, claiming it violated natural justice and was arbitrary. The order also includes the factual background of one of the appeals, which involves a mining lease for an iron ore mine in Goa. The appellant claims to have all necessary licenses and permits for mining and employs around 300 people.

The court order discusses a mining company's appeal against the suspension of its operations in the State of Goa. The company claims to have all necessary licenses and permits and has carried out social responsibility projects for the local community. The appeal challenges the report of the Justice M.B. Shah Commission, which investigated illegal mining activities in several states, including Goa. The company argues that it was not granted a hearing during the investigation and that the report has not been debated or accepted by Parliament. The order also discusses the principles of natural justice and the importance of adhering to them in administrative and quasi-judicial actions.

The court order discusses the importance of natural justice in quasi-judicial and administrative actions involving civil consequences. The audi alteram partem rule, which requires that no one should be condemned unheard, is a vital rule in administrative law. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and the court must make every effort to salvage it to the maximum extent permissible in a given case. If a statutory provision excludes the application of natural justice, the court cannot ignore the mandate of the legislature. The court must analyze the language and basic scheme of the provision conferring the power to determine whether the principles of natural justice have been excluded.

The court order discusses exceptions to the rule of audi alteram partem, which requires a person to be heard before a decision is made that affects them. The order cites specific cases where natural justice can be subject to exceptions, depending on the circumstances and language of the provision. The order also explains that the expression "public interest" in Rule 5(4) of the Rules is an exception to the rule of audi alteram partem and can only be used by the Central Government when it is in the public interest to do so. The order provides various interpretations of the term "public interest" and emphasizes that it should be understood in the context of the entire legislation and its objectives.

The court order discusses the concept of public interest and its importance in decision-making processes. It emphasizes the need to balance public interest with individual interests and the duty of the government to protect the environment. The court also criticizes the High Court for overstepping its bounds and making value judgments instead of focusing on the decision-making process of the relevant authority. The order also discusses the factual matrix of the case and the violations committed by the appellant.

The court order discusses the suspension of mining operations in Goa due to violations of environmental norms and statutory requirements. The order was passed in public interest and based on the Shah Commission's report, which found unacceptable activities being carried out in mining operations. The order suspends the environmental clearance granted to the appellant and states reasons for doing so. The order is not considered to be in violation of the principles of natural justice and is based on material and recorded reasons. The breach of environmental clearance conditions is separately pending before the competent authority. The Shah Commission's report highlights the need to fulfill the right to development while equitably meeting the developmental needs of present and future generations.

The court order states that there is an imminent threat to the environment and exhaustion of mining reserves of iron ore in the State of Goa, which could cause irreparable damage to the ecology. The order suspends the environmental clearance during the main proceedings to prevent such damage. The Supreme Court had already suspended all mining operations in the leases identified in the Shah Commission's report and transportation of iron ore and manganese
