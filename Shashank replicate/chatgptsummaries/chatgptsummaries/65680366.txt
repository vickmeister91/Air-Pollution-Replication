The Madras High Court recently had to decide whether a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution was maintainable against a private banker, ICICI Bank Limited. The court referred to a judgment by the Apex Court in Federal Bank Ltd. v. Sagar Thomas and Ors. which clarified that a writ cannot be issued where there is no non-compliance or violation of statutory provisions by the bank. The court also discussed the issue of pension and noted that Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India does not deal with the question of pension. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition.

The court order discusses the issue of pension payment to employees and the legal framework surrounding it. The court notes that while earlier views considered pension as property and a fundamental right, the latest view is that it is a matter of right and earned compensation for past service. The court also highlights the importance of following regulations and good faith in introducing new schemes or regulations related to pension. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition, stating that the petitioners have no case on both the merits and jurisdiction.

The issue of pension payment to employees has been a contentious one in India, with many employees feeling that they are not being adequately compensated for their past service. The court order notes that while earlier views considered pension as property and a fundamental right, the latest view is that it is a matter of right and earned compensation for past service. This means that employees are entitled to receive pension payments as a matter of right, rather than as a privilege or a gift.

The court also highlighted the importance of following regulations and good faith in introducing new schemes or regulations related to pension. This is important because it ensures that employees are not unfairly disadvantaged by changes to the pension system. It also ensures that employers are held accountable for any changes they make to the pension system.

The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition, stating that the petitioners had no case on both the merits and jurisdiction. This means that the court did not find any merit in the arguments put forward by the petitioners, and that the court did not have jurisdiction to hear the case.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of following regulations and good faith in introducing new schemes or regulations related to pension. They also clarify the legal framework surrounding pension payments to employees, and emphasize that pension is a matter of right and earned compensation for past service. While the court ultimately dismissed the writ petition, the orders provide important guidance for employers and employees alike on the issue of pension payments.
