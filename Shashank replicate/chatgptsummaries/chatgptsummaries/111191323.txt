The court order in question relates to a criminal complaint filed against K. Thangavel and others regarding their possession and enjoyment of certain agricultural lands. The police had issued an order of injunction against the petitioner, which the court deemed illegal as the police do not have the power to pass such orders.

The petitioner had filed a Criminal Original Petition challenging the legality of the police's order of injunction. The court, after hearing arguments from both sides, found that the police had exceeded their authority in issuing the order and that it was therefore invalid. The court set aside the impugned summons issued by the police and allowed the Criminal Original Petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the police do not have the power to pass orders of injunction. This power is reserved for the courts, and the police can only request such orders from the court. The court noted that the police had not followed the proper procedure in this case and had acted beyond their authority.

The court's decision is significant as it reaffirms the principle that the police must act within the limits of their authority. It also highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when seeking orders of injunction. The court's decision ensures that the rights of individuals are protected and that the police do not overstep their bounds.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case sets an important precedent for future cases involving the police's authority to issue orders of injunction. It emphasizes the need for the police to act within the limits of their authority and to follow proper legal procedures when seeking such orders. The court's decision ensures that the rights of individuals are protected and that the rule of law is upheld.
