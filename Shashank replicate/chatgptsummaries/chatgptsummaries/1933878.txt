The Kolkata High Court recently passed a court order in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Subhas Dutta against the extension of the Metro Rail project through the river bed of Adi Ganga. The petitioner alleged that the construction of pillars in the river bed would be detrimental to the free flow of water in the river and would harm the environment. However, the court cited Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989, which allows the railways to construct and maintain railways over any land, including rivers, and supersedes all other enactments, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court, therefore, declined to interfere in the matter but hoped that the railway administration would abide by the advice given by the expert body appointed by them to assess the environmental impact of the project.

The PIL was filed by Subhas Dutta, an environmental activist, who argued that the construction of pillars in the river bed would obstruct the free flow of water in the river and would harm the environment. He also alleged that the construction of the Metro Rail project through the river bed would violate the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioner sought a stay on the construction of the Metro Rail project through the river bed and requested the court to direct the authorities to explore alternative routes.

The court, however, cited Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989, which allows the railways to construct and maintain railways over any land, including rivers, and supersedes all other enactments, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court observed that the Metro Rail project was of national importance and would benefit the public at large. The court also noted that the railway administration had appointed an expert body to assess the environmental impact of the project and hoped that the railway administration would abide by the advice given by the expert body.

The court order has sparked a debate among environmentalists and activists who argue that the court has prioritized development over the environment. They argue that the court should have taken a more balanced approach and considered the environmental impact of the project before allowing it to proceed. They also argue that the court should have directed the authorities to explore alternative routes that would not harm the environment.

On the other hand, supporters of the Metro Rail project argue that the project is essential for the development of the city and will benefit the public at large. They argue that the court has rightly cited Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989, which allows the railways to construct and maintain railways over any land, including rivers, and supersedes all other enactments, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. They also argue that the railway administration has appointed an expert body to assess the environmental impact of the project and will take necessary measures to mitigate any harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the court order passed in the PIL filed by Subhas Dutta against the extension of the Metro Rail project through the river bed of Adi Ganga has sparked a debate among environmentalists and activists. While some argue that the court has prioritized development over the environment, others argue that the project is essential for the development of the city and will benefit the public at large. The court has cited Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989, which allows the railways to construct and maintain railways over any land, including rivers, and supersedes all other enactments, including the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court has declined to interfere in the matter but has hoped that the railway administration would abide by the advice given by the expert body appointed by them to assess the environmental impact of the project.
