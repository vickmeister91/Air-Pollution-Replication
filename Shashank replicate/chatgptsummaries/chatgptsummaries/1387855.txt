The Orissa High Court recently received a letter from the inhabitants of Balangir, alleging pollution of several tanks used for drinking water due to the callous attitude of authorities. The Balangir Municipality filed a counter-affidavit stating that they were taking steps to keep the water free from further pollution, but lack of funds prevented them from undertaking intensive renovation work of the tanks. The court emphasized the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment and directed the constitution of a committee to study the problems and recommend measures to remedy the pollution of water in the tanks.

The issue of pollution of water bodies is a serious concern in India, and the Orissa High Court's decision to take up the matter is a welcome step. The court's emphasis on the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment is a reminder that the government has a duty to ensure that citizens have access to clean and safe drinking water.

The Balangir Municipality's counter-affidavit stating that they were taking steps to keep the water free from further pollution is a positive development. However, the lack of funds preventing them from undertaking intensive renovation work of the tanks is a cause for concern. The court's decision to constitute a committee to study the problems and recommend measures to remedy the pollution of water in the tanks is a step in the right direction.

The committee should be tasked with identifying the sources of pollution and recommending measures to prevent further pollution. It should also recommend measures to clean up the tanks and ensure that they are safe for drinking water. The committee should be given a deadline to submit its report, and the government should ensure that its recommendations are implemented in a timely manner.

The issue of pollution of water bodies is not limited to Balangir, and it is a problem that affects many parts of India. The government should take proactive measures to prevent pollution of water bodies and ensure that citizens have access to clean and safe drinking water. This includes enforcing environmental regulations, providing adequate funding for the maintenance of water bodies, and promoting awareness among citizens about the importance of protecting the environment.

In conclusion, the Orissa High Court's decision to take up the matter of pollution of water in Balangir is a positive development. The court's emphasis on the constitutional mandate to protect and improve the environment is a reminder that the government has a duty to ensure that citizens have access to clean and safe drinking water. The constitution of a committee to study the problems and recommend measures to remedy the pollution of water in the tanks is a step in the right direction. The government should ensure that the committee's recommendations are implemented in a timely manner and take proactive measures to prevent pollution of water bodies across the country.
