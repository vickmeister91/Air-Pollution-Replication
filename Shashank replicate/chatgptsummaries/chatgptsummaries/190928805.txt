The Madras High Court has issued three court orders related to the construction of a coal jetty near a proposed power plant in Udangudi Village, Tiruchendur Taluk, Thoothukudi District. The first court order was issued in response to a writ petition filed by B. Ramkumar Adityan, an advocate, requesting a writ of mandamus to direct respondents 2, 4, 8, 12, and 13 to abandon the construction of the Coal Jetty at the 2 x 669 MW Udangudi Super Critical Thermal Power Project. The petitioner claimed that the construction of the Coal Jetty would cause environmental damage. The court ordered a public interest litigation and directed the respondents to abandon the construction of the Coal Jetty.

The second court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner against the construction of a coal jetty near a proposed power plant. The petitioner, a practicing advocate, raised concerns about the potential impact on the marine ecology and livelihood of fishermen in the area. However, the court found no evidence of adverse impacts and dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner lacked expert knowledge and had not established any statutory violations or regulations. The court also noted that the power plant was important for the state and that the alternative suggested by the petitioner was not feasible. The court further mentioned that the petitioner had previously withdrawn a similar writ petition and lacked sufficient materials to show the bona fides of the petition.

The third court order dismissed a writ petition filed by the petitioner for a similar relief in relation to the construction of a coal jetty, stating that it was either a publicity interest litigation or a litigation motivated for extraneous reasons. The court had previously dismissed a similar petition with liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal, and the petitioner did not explain why they filed a new petition for the same relief. The court ordered the petition to be dismissed and closed the connected miscellaneous petition. The order was sent to various government officials and organizations.

The construction of the coal jetty near the proposed power plant has been a contentious issue, with advocates and environmentalists raising concerns about the potential impact on the marine ecology and livelihood of fishermen in the area. The first court order, issued in response to a writ petition filed by B. Ramkumar Adityan, directed the respondents to abandon the construction of the Coal Jetty. The court found that the construction of the Coal Jetty would cause environmental damage and ordered a public interest litigation.

However, the second court order dismissed a writ petition filed by a petitioner against the construction of a coal jetty near a proposed power plant. The court found no evidence of adverse impacts and dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner lacked expert knowledge and had not established any statutory violations or regulations. The court also noted that the power plant was important for the state and that the alternative suggested by the petitioner was not feasible. The court further mentioned that the petitioner had previously withdrawn a similar writ petition and lacked sufficient materials to show the bona fides of the petition.

The third court order dismissed a writ petition filed by the petitioner for a similar relief in relation to the construction of a coal jetty, stating that it was either a publicity interest litigation or a litigation motivated for extraneous reasons. The court had previously dismissed a similar petition with liberty to approach the National Green Tribunal, and the petitioner did not explain why they filed a new petition for the same relief. The court ordered the petition to be dismissed and closed the connected miscellaneous petition.

Overall, the court orders reflect the complexity of balancing environmental concerns with the need for energy infrastructure development. While the first court order directed the respondents to abandon the construction of the Coal Jetty, the second and third court orders dismissed writ petitions filed against the construction of the coal jetty, citing lack of evidence and insufficient materials to show the bona fides of the petitions. The issue remains contentious, and it is likely that further legal action will be taken in the future.
