The court order pertains to a case where the accused, Mohd. Ishaq Baig, was found in possession of 159 shawls suspected to be made from 'Shatoosh' derived from Tibetan Antelopes, which is a banned 'animal article' under The Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The shawls were seized and sent for scientific analysis, which confirmed that 10 shawls contained the Guard Hairs/fibres of the Sahtoosh variety of Tibetan Antelopes. The accused pleaded guilty and was convicted under section 51 of the Act read with section 49 and section 49B (1) of the said Act. The court found the evidence presented by the prosecution to be credible and trustworthy.

The court order discusses the examination of 159 shawls for the presence of Tibetan Antelope guard hairs/fibers, which are banned under The Wildlife Protection Act. The expert witness, PW 2, examined the shawls and found 10 of them to contain the banned material. The accused was found in possession of these shawls, and the onus was shifted upon him to prove his innocence. The accused denied the evidence of the expert witness and argued that mere possession of the shawls is not an offense under the Act. However, the court held that the accused was involved in the trade or business of the banned animal article product and convicted him under the Act.

The court order states that the accused was found in possession of 159 shawls, which were believed to be made from the banned 'animal article' product Sahtoosh shawls. The Wildlife Protection Act makes it a presumption of unlawful possession if someone is found in possession of such items, unless proven otherwise. The accused did not deny being in possession of the shawls, and no evidence was presented to suggest that the accused was falsely implicated. The court also noted that minor discrepancies in witness statements do not necessarily make the prosecution's case unbelievable. The non-compliance of section 100(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires the joining of respectable local inhabitants in recovery proceedings, was not enough to acquit the accused. The court emphasized that justice cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let a hundred guilty escape than punish an innocent.

The court order states that reasonable doubt must be based on evidence and common sense, and vague hunches cannot replace judicial evaluation. The accused's possession of 159 shawls, 10 of which contained banned animal articles, was established beyond reasonable doubt. The accused failed to rebut the presumption against him, and his claim that the search and seizure was illegal was dismissed. The report of the scientific expert was deemed believable despite the accused's objections.

The court order discusses a case involving the possession of shawls made from Sahtoosh, which is derived from Tibetan antelopes and is a banned animal article under The Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The defense argues that the report on the shawls is unreliable due to the procedure and samples chosen for testing. However, the court finds that the expert witness is qualified and experienced, and the accused did not provide any evidence to rebut the report. The court also rejects the defense's argument that the percentage of Sahtoosh in the shawls was not established, as the expert only examined Guard Hairs and not the entire shawls. The court cites previous cases and legislative intent to support its decision that hair is a part of the animal article and trading in wild animals and derivatives is prohibited.

The court order discusses the prohibition of trade and commerce in trophies and animal articles derived from certain animals, including the Chiru. The court concludes that the inclusion of the word "hair" in the definition of trophy does not exclude it from the definition of animal articles, and any intention to exclude animal hair from the definition of animal article would defeat the purpose and intent of the legislature. The court also states that any person found carrying on trade or dealing in Shahtoosh, made from the hair of the Chiru, is liable to be proceeded under the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused in this case is found guilty of the offence under section 49/49B (1) of The Wildlife Protection Act for being involved in the trade or business of the banned animal article product, Sahtoosh shawls, as a dealer.

In summary, the court order pertains to the possession and trade of shawls made from Sahtoosh, which is derived from Tibetan antelopes and is a banned animal article under The Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The accused was found in possession of 159 shawls, 10 of which contained banned animal articles, and was convicted under section 51 of the Act read with section 49 and section 49B (1) of the said Act. The court found the evidence presented by the prosecution to be credible and trustworthy, and the accused failed to rebut the presumption against him. The court also emphasized that justice cannot be made sterile on the plea that it is better to let a hundred guilty escape than punish an innocent. The court cited previous cases and legislative intent to support its decision that hair is a part of the animal article and trading in wild animals and derivatives is prohibited.
