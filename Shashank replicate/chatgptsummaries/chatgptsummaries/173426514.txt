The court order in question pertains to a bail application made by Ashwani Purohit, who was arrested in connection with a crime registered by Police Station City Kotwali, District Bhind for offences under Sections 302, 307, 341, 294, 34 of IPC. Purohit's first bail application was dismissed for want of prosecution. 

During the hearing of the second bail application, Purohit's counsel argued that the presence of two more abrasions on the dead body of the deceased have not been explained, which shows that the prosecution story is doubtful. The counsel further argued that Purohit was admitted in Primary Health Center, Itawah and therefore, he was not present on the spot at the time of the incident. 

Purohit's counsel also contended that the applicant was all the time asking for an independent enquiry but his prayer was not accepted. The court, however, dismissed the application considering the allegations made against the applicant.

The court's decision to dismiss Purohit's bail application was based on the gravity of the charges against him. The charges against Purohit include murder, attempted murder, wrongful restraint, and obscene acts. These are serious charges that carry severe penalties, and the court was not convinced that Purohit should be released on bail.

Purohit's counsel argued that the prosecution's case was doubtful because the presence of two more abrasions on the dead body of the deceased had not been explained. However, the court found that this argument was not sufficient to cast doubt on the prosecution's case. The court noted that the prosecution had presented a prima facie case against Purohit, and that the presence of two more abrasions on the dead body of the deceased did not necessarily mean that the prosecution's case was doubtful.

Purohit's counsel also argued that Purohit was not present on the spot at the time of the incident because he was admitted in Primary Health Center, Itawah. However, the court found that this argument was not supported by any evidence. The court noted that Purohit had not produced any medical records to show that he was admitted in Primary Health Center, Itawah at the time of the incident.

Purohit's counsel also contended that the applicant was all the time asking for an independent enquiry but his prayer was not accepted. However, the court found that this argument was not relevant to the bail application. The court noted that the question of an independent enquiry was a matter for the trial court to decide, and that it was not relevant to the question of whether Purohit should be released on bail.

In conclusion, the court dismissed Purohit's bail application based on the gravity of the charges against him and the prosecution's prima facie case against him. The court was not convinced by Purohit's arguments that the prosecution's case was doubtful or that he was not present on the spot at the time of the incident. The court also found that Purohit's argument regarding an independent enquiry was not relevant to the bail application.
