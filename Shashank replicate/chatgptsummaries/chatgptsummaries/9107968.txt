The court order discussed in this summary pertains to two writ petitions filed by Smt. Divya against the Public Health and Family Welfare department. The petitioners were appointed as Auxiliary Nurse cum Midwife, but their services were terminated without any show cause notice or enquiry. The respondents took different stands in three returns filed before the court. The court found the termination order to be stigmatic and punitive in nature and quashed it. The court also emphasized the importance of following the principles of natural justice in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The court cited the case of Uma Nath Pandey v. State of U.P. to explain the concept of natural justice.

The court order discusses the importance of natural justice in decision-making processes, particularly in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. The principles of natural justice, including the rules of nemo judex in causa sua (no one shall be a judge in their own cause) and audi alteram partem (hear the other side), are firmly grounded in Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantee equality before the law and equal protection of the law. The court notes that following audi alteram partem will not be a useless formality, particularly in cases where orders for dismissal are identical in all cases except for the name of the village. The court emphasizes that natural justice is the essence of fair adjudication and is deeply rooted in tradition and conscience.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the audi alteram partem rule, which enforces the equality clause in Article 14 of the Constitution, applies to administrative orders that adversely affect a party unless excluded by law. Failure to provide a hearing results in arbitrary decisions, which are contrary to equality. The case in question involved the termination of 84 Aanganwadi workers without following natural justice and fair play principles. The court allowed the writ petitions and awarded the petitioners 50% backwages. The order was to be placed in the record of the connected writ petition.
