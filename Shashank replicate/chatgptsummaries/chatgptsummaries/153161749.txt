The court order OJC/13124/2000, dated November 26, 2018, is a significant ruling that pertains to a writ petition filed with the court requesting that the settlement of land in the encroached area within the forest area be stopped, that the District Collector be directed to evict encroachers of all forest areas in Nowrangpur district, and that the Chief Conservator of Forests of the Ministry of Environment be directed to identify and prosecute officials of the state government who have settled forest lands in violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980.

The court directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Odisha, to treat the writ petition as a representation and issue notice to encroachers who have encroached within the entire forest area in Nawarangpur district. The encroachers will be given an opportunity to be heard, and if the encroachments are found to be illegal, suitable action will be taken against them in accordance with the law. The entire exercise will be completed within six months from the date of filing of the representation/writ petition following the principles of natural justice.

This court order is significant because it addresses the issue of illegal encroachment of forest lands, which has been a major problem in India for many years. The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, was enacted to protect forests and wildlife in the country, but it has been violated by many officials of the state government who have settled forest lands illegally. This has resulted in the destruction of forests and wildlife habitats, which has had a negative impact on the environment and the people who depend on these resources for their livelihoods.

The court order is a step in the right direction towards protecting forests and wildlife in India. By directing the District Collector to evict encroachers of all forest areas in Nowrangpur district, the court is sending a strong message that illegal encroachment of forest lands will not be tolerated. The Chief Conservator of Forests of the Ministry of Environment has also been directed to identify and prosecute officials of the state government who have settled forest lands in violation of the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. This will help to ensure that those who violate the law are held accountable for their actions.

The court has also directed the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Odisha, to treat the writ petition as a representation and issue notice to encroachers who have encroached within the entire forest area in Nawarangpur district.

If the encroachments are found to be illegal, suitable action will be taken against them in accordance with the law. This will help to ensure that justice is served and that the rule of law is upheld.
