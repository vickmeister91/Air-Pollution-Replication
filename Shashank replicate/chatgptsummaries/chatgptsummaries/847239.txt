The court order in question pertains to a civil review petition filed by the proprietor of M/s. Durga Stone Crusher, seeking a review of the judgment passed in a writ petition filed against the establishment of the crusher unit. The writ petition was filed on the grounds that the siting criteria formulated for establishment of stone crushers were violated and that the 'No Objection Certificates' were issued without keeping in view the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court, after hearing the arguments, concluded that the siting criteria should be adhered to and that the crusher unit in question was established within 100 meters from the village boundary and 500 meters from a school, making it unsuitable for operation. The review petitioner argued that the siting criteria were not mandatory and that the crusher unit would not cause pollution. However, the court dismissed the review petition, stating that all the questions raised had been dealt with in detail in the judgment and that the review petition had no merit.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to siting criteria while establishing stone crushers. The siting criteria are formulated to ensure that the establishment of stone crushers does not cause harm to the environment and the health of the people living in the vicinity. The court's decision to dismiss the review petition reinforces the need to follow the siting criteria strictly.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The act provides for the protection and improvement of the environment and the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants, and property. The act lays down the guidelines for the establishment of industries and other activities that may have an impact on the environment. The act also provides for the punishment of those who violate its provisions.

The court's decision in this case is a reminder to all industries and establishments to follow the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and to adhere to the siting criteria while establishing their units. The act is a crucial tool in protecting the environment and the health of the people living in the vicinity of industries and other activities that may have an impact on the environment.

The court's decision also highlights the need for the government to ensure that the provisions of the act are implemented effectively. The act provides for the establishment of various bodies, such as the Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution Control Boards, to monitor and regulate the activities that may have an impact on the environment. The government must ensure that these bodies are adequately staffed and equipped to carry out their functions effectively.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case reinforces the need to adhere to the siting criteria while establishing stone crushers and other industries. The decision also underscores the importance of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and the need for its effective implementation. The act is a crucial tool in protecting the environment and the health of the people living in the vicinity of industries and other activities that may have an impact on the environment.
