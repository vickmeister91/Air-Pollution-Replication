In the first case, G. Raja filed a Criminal Revision Case challenging the order of the learned Judicial Magistrate in Gudiyatham, which dismissed his application for the return of his seized vehicle. The petitioner's vehicle was seized by the Forest Range Officer in connection with a case registered under The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The offence was compounded, and the petitioner paid the compounding fee. However, the vehicle was not returned to him, and the court below dismissed his application for its return on the ground that the vehicle had already been confiscated.

The Honourable High Court of Madras allowed the Criminal Revision Case and directed the respondents to produce the vehicle before the Magistrate concerned, who shall deal with it and pass orders in accordance with the law for its return to the petitioner's custody. This decision was made after considering the fact that the petitioner had already paid the compounding fee and the offence had been compounded. Therefore, there was no reason for the vehicle to be confiscated.

The second case involves two judges, the I Additional Sessions Judge in Erode and the District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate in Perundurai, Erode District. The court order requires the return of custody to the petitioner. It is not clear what the case is about or why the custody of the petitioner is being returned. However, it can be assumed that the decision was made after considering the facts and evidence presented in the case.

In both cases, the court orders were made after considering the facts and evidence presented. The decision in the first case was based on the fact that the offence had been compounded and the petitioner had already paid the compounding fee. Therefore, there was no reason for the vehicle to be confiscated. In the second case, the decision was made after considering the facts and evidence presented in the case, although it is not clear what the case is about.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of presenting all relevant facts and evidence in a case. It is also important for judges to consider all the facts and evidence presented before making a decision. In the first case, the court order was made after considering the fact that the offence had been compounded and the petitioner had already paid the compounding fee. In the second case, the decision was made after considering the facts and evidence presented in the case.
