In a recent court case, a petitioner filed a writ petition seeking direction to the first respondent to take action against the third respondent for running a piggery without obtaining statutory license/clearance. The court granted an interim order preventing the third respondent from operating the piggery without a valid license. The third respondent had previously filed a writ petition seeking a license for conducting the pig farm, which was dismissed by the court. The court noted that the third respondent did not have the requisite license to run the piggery and ordered that the third respondent shall not conduct any piggery without obtaining proper license.

The court order states that the third respondent cannot conduct any piggery without obtaining a proper license. The Pollution Control Board found that the petitioner's claim of pollution caused by the third respondent was correct, and therefore, the piggery was ordered to be closed down. The court has made the interim order absolute and directed the concerned respondents to take necessary steps to close down the piggery as ordered by the Pollution Control Board. The third respondent can pursue the matter before the Tribunal where the Revision Petition is pending. The third respondent is granted three weeks to make arrangements to close down the piggery, failing which the concerned respondent will implement the closure.
