The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for quashing an order passed by the Additional Session Judge Court No. 2, Etah in Session Trial No. 320 of 2004, State v. Mahesh and Ors., under Section 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The accused in the case had moved bail applications and were granted bail. However, the accused applicant, Mahesh, had filed a record to show that he was on duty in the military at the date and time of the incident.

At the stage of framing of charges, the applicant moved an application in the court of the II Additional Session Judge, Etah, stating that senior authorities of the military had sent a letter to the Superintendent of Police, Etah, on 24.4.2003, asserting that Mahesh Kumar Singh was on duty in the military on the date of the incident. The prayer was rejected by the Additional Session Judge, and against that order, the accused filed the application under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

The court, in its order, held that the accused has no right to summon any document at the stage of framing of charges and dismissed the application. The court's decision was based on the fact that the accused had already been granted bail, and the question of summoning documents at the stage of framing of charges did not arise. The court also noted that the accused had not challenged the order granting bail, and therefore, the question of summoning documents to prove his innocence did not arise.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and the rights of the accused at the stage of framing of charges. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following due process and the rules of evidence in criminal trials.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing an order passed by the Additional Session Judge Court No. 2, Etah in Session Trial No. 320 of 2004, State v. Mahesh and Ors., under Section 302/34 of the IPC. The court held that the accused has no right to summon any document at the stage of framing of charges and dismissed the application. The court's decision clarifies the scope of Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and the rights of the accused at the stage of framing of charges.
