The court order pertains to a group of writ petitions challenging the validity of the Telangana Teachers (Regulation of Teachers) Rules, 2018, which were notified in G.O.Ms. No.16, School Education (Service II) Department dated 06.06.2018. The petitioners, who are teachers working in government schools or schools under the control of local bodies, are aggrieved by the action of the State Government in effecting transfers and prescribing the Rules for effecting transfers of Headmasters, teachers, etc.

The court examines the scope of judicial review in matters relating to transfers and concludes that unless the order of transfer is vitiated by malafides or is made in violation of any operative guidelines or Rules, Courts should not interfere with the administrative authority's decision. The court discusses the issue of transfer orders for government employees and emphasizes that unless the transfer order is made in violation of guidelines or rules, or is a result of malafide intentions, the court should not interfere with it. The order also states that government employees do not have a legal right to insist on being posted at a particular place and that transfer orders are a normal part of service.

The court also examines the 2018 Rules related to transfers of teachers in Telangana and dismisses the argument that they violate a previous order of status quo. The court concludes that the State Government is entitled to effect transfers management-wise without integrating them and without disturbing seniority and promotions. The court upholds G.O.Ms.No.16, dated 6.6.2018. The order of status-quo, which prevents the integration of teachers in local body schools and government schools, is still in force. Rule 5(5) of the 2018 Rules stipulates that all transfers shall be effected within the present management. The court clarifies that the order of status-quo does not render the 2017 amendment to the Presidential Order illegal.

The court states that a suspension of an order does not wipe it out from existence, but only holds it in abeyance. The order of status quo passed by the court only disables the government from implementing the amended Presidential Order, but does not wipe it out from existence. The court also discusses the ambiguity surrounding the Presidential Order and its application to teachers in local body schools. The court concludes that the Presidential Order only requires a local cadre to be organized for civil posts in departments of the State Government, and not for posts under a local authority. Therefore, teachers in local body schools were not organized into a local cadre, unlike teachers in government schools.

The court finds that teachers in government schools are organized into local cadres in each district, while teachers in Panchayat Raj institutions are not. The 1975 Presidential Order recognizes only the erstwhile 10 districts in the State of Telangana as the district within which a local cadre is required to be organized. The creation of 31 districts in 2016 has no bearing on local area reservation to be provided in terms of the Presidential Order. The court also notes that the 2018 Rules fall foul of the law declared in previous court cases and that transfers of teachers in local body schools can only be made within the erstwhile 10 districts, which are still regarded as a local area. The court also observes that the State Government should take necessary remedial measures in regard to promotions and seniority of teachers in local body schools.

The court finds that the prescription of the erstwhile ten districts as a unit of transfer is not irrational and does not violate Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India. The court also notes that the 1975 Presidential Order still governs direct recruitment of teachers in local body schools and prescribes the erstwhile ten districts as the local area within which direct recruitment is to be made. The court further explains that the incongruity in recruitment and transfers being made within the erstwhile ten districts and seniority and promotions being required to be made within the newly formed 31 districts is because the 1975 Presidential Order continues to recognise only the erstwhile ten districts of the State of Telangana.

The court discusses the burden of proof in challenging categorization or prescription, stating that the party attacking it must show that it is unreasonable and violates the Constitution. The court also discusses the requirement of laying rules before both houses of the legislature, stating that non-compliance with this requirement does not affect the validity of the rules. The court concludes that the 2018 Rules are valid and not in violation of the Constitution.

The court states that the omission to comply with the requirement of laying the Rules before the State Legislature would not affect the validity of the Rules and their coming into force. The laying of the Rules before the legislature is merely directory and not mandatory. The court also dismisses the contention that Rule 2 of the 2018 Rules is a colourable legislation. The intent behind the prescription of the ten districts as a unit of transfer is to integrate teachers working in government schools and local body schools into one common cadre. The court concludes that the 2018 Rules are not liable to be struck down for procedural violation of Section 99(3) of the A.P. Education Act, 1982.

The court discusses the concept of "colourable legislation" and how the legislature cannot exceed its power, directly or indirectly. The court also rules that the 2018 Rules supersede all earlier rules and
