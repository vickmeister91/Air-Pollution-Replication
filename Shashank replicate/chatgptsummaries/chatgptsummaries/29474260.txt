The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Sh. Rajinder Kumar Bidaney against an order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate dismissing his application under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C. The petitioner had filed a criminal complaint under Section 200 of the Cr. P. C. against the respondents for various offences under the IPC.

The petitioner had approached the Trial Court with an application under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C. seeking directions to the SHO to register an FIR and investigate the matter. However, the Trial Court had dismissed the application on the grounds that the petitioner had failed to make out a prima facie case for the offences alleged.

Aggrieved by the order of the Trial Court, the petitioner had filed a criminal revision before the Metropolitan Magistrate. However, the Metropolitan Magistrate had also dismissed the revision petition on the grounds that the Trial Court was not bound to direct the SHO to register an FIR and investigate the matter on the basis of the application moved by the petitioner under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C.

The petitioner had then approached the High Court with a criminal revision petition challenging the orders of the Trial Court and the Metropolitan Magistrate. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the Trial Court was not bound to direct the SHO to register an FIR and investigate the matter on the basis of the application moved by the petitioner under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C.

The High Court observed that the power under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C. is an extraordinary power and should be used sparingly and only in cases where the facts and circumstances of the case warrant such an intervention. The High Court further held that the Trial Court had rightly dismissed the application of the petitioner as he had failed to make out a prima facie case for the offences alleged.

The High Court also observed that the revision petition filed by the petitioner was misconceived as the order of the Trial Court was not a final order and the petitioner had an alternative remedy of filing a complaint under Section 200 of the Cr. P. C. The High Court dismissed the revision petition and returned the Trial Court Record.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Sh. Rajinder Kumar Bidaney against an order passed by a Metropolitan Magistrate dismissing his application under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C. The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the Trial Court was not bound to direct the SHO to register an FIR and investigate the matter on the basis of the application moved by the petitioner under Section 156(3) of the Cr. P. C. The High Court further held that the Trial Court had rightly dismissed the application of the petitioner as he had failed to make out a prima facie case for the offences alleged. The High Court dismissed the revision petition and returned the Trial Court Record.
