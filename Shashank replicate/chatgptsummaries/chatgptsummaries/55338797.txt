The Madhya Pradesh High Court has issued an order that the slaughterhouse located at Sadar Bazar cannot be used until it complies with the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Indore Municipal Corporation had already closed the slaughterhouse due to non-compliance. The petitioners, who are licensees of the shops in the meat market, cannot continue to use the slaughterhouse until the necessary consent is obtained. The court has directed the Municipal Corporation not to use the slaughterhouse or any building or shops without obtaining consent under the aforementioned acts.

The order was issued in response to a petition filed by the licensees of the shops in the meat market. The petitioners had challenged the closure of the slaughterhouse by the Indore Municipal Corporation. They argued that the closure had caused them financial losses and that the Municipal Corporation had not followed the due process of law in closing the slaughterhouse.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that the slaughterhouse had indeed been closed due to non-compliance with the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that the slaughterhouse had not obtained the necessary consent under these acts and had therefore violated the law.

The court also found that the closure of the slaughterhouse had been done in accordance with the law. The Indore Municipal Corporation had issued a notice to the slaughterhouse, asking it to comply with the relevant acts. When the slaughterhouse failed to comply, the Municipal Corporation had closed it down. The court found that the Municipal Corporation had followed the due process of law in closing the slaughterhouse.

The court, therefore, dismissed the petition filed by the licensees of the shops in the meat market. The court held that the closure of the slaughterhouse was justified and that the licensees could not continue to use the slaughterhouse until the necessary consent was obtained.

The court's order has important implications for the meat industry in Madhya Pradesh. It highlights the need for slaughterhouses to comply with the relevant environmental laws. The order also emphasizes the importance of due process of law in closing down businesses that violate environmental laws.

The order is also significant because it protects the rights of the licensees of the shops in the meat market. The licensees had argued that the closure of the slaughterhouse had caused them financial losses. The court's order ensures that the licensees are not allowed to use the slaughterhouse until the necessary consent is obtained. This protects the environment while also safeguarding the rights of the licensees.

In conclusion, the Madhya Pradesh High Court's order regarding the closure of the slaughterhouse at Sadar Bazar highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws. The order emphasizes the need for due process of law in closing down businesses that violate environmental laws. The order also protects the rights of the licensees of the shops in the meat market. The court's decision is a step towards ensuring a cleaner and healthier environment in Madhya Pradesh.
