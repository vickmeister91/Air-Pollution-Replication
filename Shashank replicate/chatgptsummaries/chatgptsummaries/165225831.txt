The Patna High Court recently heard a case brought by M/s Naturals Dairy (P) Ltd against the State of Bihar and others. The petitioner sought to quash an order to close its operation due to non-compliance with statutory prescriptions. The court found that the order failed to abide by statutory prescriptions and that the establishment concerned was entitled to advance notice before any direction for closure was issued. 

The court directed the Board and its authorities to dispose of the petitioner's application for issuance of a 'Consent to Operate' order under the Water Act and the Air Act within four weeks and stayed the operation of the closure order. The interim order was not to be treated as permission to engage in business purposes. This means that the petitioner can continue its operations until the Board decides on its application for a 'Consent to Operate' order. 

The court order allows the writ petition with a specific direction, and states that if the Board decides in favor of the petitioner, the order will no longer be in effect. The date of uploading and transmission is provided. This means that the petitioner's fate is now in the hands of the Board and its authorities. If they grant the 'Consent to Operate' order, the petitioner can continue its operations without any hindrance. However, if the Board decides against the petitioner, the closure order will come into effect once again. 

The court's decision is a significant victory for the petitioner as it allows them to continue their operations while they await the Board's decision. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following statutory prescriptions and providing advance notice before issuing any direction for closure. 

It is important to note that the court's decision does not absolve the petitioner of their responsibility to comply with statutory prescriptions. The petitioner must still ensure that they comply with all relevant laws and regulations. 

In conclusion, the Patna High Court's decision in the case brought by M/s Naturals Dairy (P) Ltd against the State of Bihar and others is a significant victory for the petitioner. The court's decision allows the petitioner to continue their operations while they await the Board's decision on their application for a 'Consent to Operate' order. The court's decision also highlights the importance of following statutory prescriptions and providing advance notice before issuing any direction for closure.
