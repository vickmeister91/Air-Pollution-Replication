The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to eviction cases where the plaintiff, a landlord, seeks to evict the defendants, who are tenants, on the grounds of personal necessity. In the first case, the plaintiff had filed a suit for eviction of the defendants from a house on the grounds of personal necessity. The trial court had ruled in favor of the plaintiff, and the defendants had challenged the decision on various grounds, including that the plaintiff was not the owner of the house and that the trial court did not consider the option of partial eviction. The court heard arguments from both sides and considered the scope of revisional power under the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act.

The court examined the findings of the trial court on issues such as ownership of the suit premises, relationship of landlord and tenant, personal necessity of the plaintiff, partial eviction, and the plea of the defendants that they are in possession of the suit premises as purchasers under three agreements of sale. The court upheld the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit premises and that there is a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. The court also found that the defendants' plea that they are in possession of the suit premises as purchasers under three agreements of sale is not tenable in law.

In the second case, the court discussed the scope of revisional power of the court under section 14(8) of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act. The court can consider questions permissible under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court can also re-appraise evidence and reverse findings of the trial court if it has arrived at a finding of fact upon erroneous consideration of legal provision or acted contrary to law. The court examined the findings of the trial court on issues such as ownership of the suit premises, relationship of landlord and tenant, personal necessity of the plaintiff, partial eviction, and the plea of the defendants that they are in possession of the suit premises as purchasers under three agreements of sale. The court upheld the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff is the owner of the suit premises and that there is a relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. The court also found that the defendants' plea that they are in possession of the suit premises as purchasers under three agreements of sale is not tenable in law.

In the third case, the defendants claimed to be owners of a property, but the court found that they were only tenants or lessees. The court also found that the plaintiff had a genuine and reasonable need for the property for personal use, and therefore granted a decree in their favor. The order cites several legal precedents to support the decision.

In the fourth case, the court discussed a case where the plaintiff-landlady wants to evict a tenant for personal necessity. The court below misdirected itself in law by holding that the landlord has the choice to evict any tenant, even if other premises were let out at a higher rent. The court must determine the truth of the landlord's assertion of personal necessity and apply an objective test to determine if the requirement is bona fide. The landlord must prove that they genuinely require the premises for personal necessity. The court also discusses the issue of partial eviction and cites previous court decisions that state the court must consider the extent of the premises that the landlord reasonably requires and whether such a requirement will be substantially satisfied by ordering partial eviction. The court upholds the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff's requirement of the suit premises was a bonafide one.

In the fifth case, the court order pertains to an eviction case where the plaintiff, a landlord, seeks to evict the defendants, who are tenants, on the grounds of personal necessity. The court finds that the plaintiff's need for personal accommodation is genuine, but the number of rooms required has not been considered. The court sets aside the previous judgment and sends the case back to the lower court for reconsideration. The court also upholds the finding that partial eviction is not feasible as the plaintiff's need for accommodation cannot be fulfilled by it. The court dismisses the revision application and orders the defendants to vacate the premises within one month.

In all of these cases, the court considered the scope of revisional power under the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act and examined the findings of the trial court on issues such as ownership of the suit premises, relationship of landlord and tenant, personal necessity of the plaintiff, partial eviction, and the plea of the defendants. The court also discussed the issue of partial eviction and cited previous court decisions that state the court must consider the extent of the premises that the landlord reasonably requires and whether such a requirement will be substantially satisfied by ordering partial eviction. The court upheld the finding of the trial court that the plaintiff's requirement of the suit premises was a bonafide one and ordered the defendants to vacate the premises within one month.
