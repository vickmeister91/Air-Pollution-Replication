Three court orders have been summarized, all of which pertain to cases involving the possession of skins of protected wild animals without proper documentation or authority. The first case involves two accused individuals, Om Prakash and Rajesh Kumar, who were found in possession of a large number of such skins during a raid conducted by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police and Wildlife Department of Delhi Administration. The owner of the house where the skins were found, Sansar Chand, had already been discharged. The accused failed to produce any documents to possess or deal in the skins, and were convicted under Section 55 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, for contravention of provisions of Section 9, 49 & 49B(1) of the Act and sentenced accordingly.

The second case involves two accused individuals who were arrested for carrying goods in a vehicle that was found to contain skins of wild animals. The defense argued that the accused were innocent and that there were material contradictions in the statements of prosecution witnesses. However, the court found the prosecution's case to be proved beyond reasonable doubt based on the testimony of witnesses and the recovery of the skins from the accused's possession. The court also rejected the defense's argument that the case property was not sent for expert opinion, stating that a wildlife inspector can identify animal articles even without a diploma or degree in the same. The court also found the testimony of defense witnesses to be unhelpful.

The third case involves accused individuals who were found in possession of wild animal skins without a license or authority, which is a violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the accused have failed to provide any explanation for their false implication. Therefore, both accused are held guilty and convicted for the offense. The main file will be consigned to the record room, and a miscellaneous file will be prepared for the purpose of arguments on sentence. The judgment will be sent to the server www.delhidistrictcourt.nic.in.

In all three cases, the accused were found to be in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which aims to protect and conserve wildlife in India. The possession of skins of protected wild animals without proper documentation or authority is a serious offense under this act. The courts have found the accused guilty based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, which includes the recovery of the skins from the accused's possession and the testimony of witnesses. The defense's arguments have been rejected by the courts, and the accused have been sentenced accordingly.

It is important to note that the possession of skins of protected wild animals is not only illegal but also contributes to the illegal wildlife trade, which is a major threat to the survival of many species. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is a crucial tool in the fight against this trade and the conservation of India's wildlife. The courts' strict enforcement of this act sends a strong message that such offenses will not be tolerated and that those who engage in them will be held accountable.
