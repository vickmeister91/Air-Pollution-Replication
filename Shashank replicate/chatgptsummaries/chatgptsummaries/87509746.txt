The Patna High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to four criminal writ jurisdiction cases filed by Mithilesh Kumar Singh against various government officials and departments in Bihar. Singh, who is the director of Broad Son Commodities Pvt. Ltd., sought relief from alleged harassment and false charges filed against him. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued an oral judgment on August 26, 2019.

The court order pertains to four writ petitions involving identical facts and questions of law. Singh is a director of a company accused of illegally excavating excess sand in violation of various rules and acts. He seeks to quash the FIR against him, arguing that excess mining is not illegal mining and that the jurisdictional magistrate cannot take cognizance of any offense under the MMDR Act or the 1972 Rules or 1986 Act in the absence of a complaint filed by a person authorized on behalf of the government. Singh also argues that the ingredients of the offenses under Sections 379, 406, and 420 of the IPC are not attracted. The State argues that the allegations made in the FIR are clear.

The court order states that Singh, who is a director of a company that excavated excess sand from sand ghats in violation of the terms and conditions of the agreement, is liable to be prosecuted for theft of state revenue. The court also notes that excess mining is a civil wrong and not illegal mining, and that the company had a valid license for mining sand in the district of Patna. The court concludes that the offense punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be attracted in this case.

The court order further states that the company is a valid licensee for mining sand in the district of Patna and therefore, the offense punishable under Section 21 of the MMDR Act would not be attracted. The court explains that for the offense alleging violation of any provisions of the MMDR Act or any rules made thereunder, an FIR cannot be instituted rather a complaint in writing has to be made by a person authorized in this behalf. The court also discusses the definition of 'complaint' and explains that an FIR cannot be treated as a complaint. The court further explains that the jurisdictional court can take cognizance of any offense under the MMDR Act or the rules made thereunder only upon a written complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C filed by a person authorized in this behalf. The court also discusses the offense punishable under Section 379 of the IPC and explains that in absence of any allegation that the Company excavated sand in a clandestine manner with an intent to remove mineral dishonestly, the offense punishable under Section 379 of the IPC would not be attracted against it.

The court order also states that in cases of theft of sand and gravel from government land, the police can investigate and submit a report to a magistrate for taking cognizance against the accused. However, if a person has a valid license or lease for excavation, excess mining cannot be considered theft. The court also states that vicarious liability is not recognized in criminal law, and a person cannot be charged for an offense committed by a company unless the company is also accused. The court notes that the informant in the case, a mining inspector, is not authorized to file a complaint under Section 19 of the Environment (Protection) Act, and therefore, the FIR filed against the accused under Section 15 of the Act is invalid.

In summary, the Patna High Court quashed FIRs against a mining company, stating that the prosecution could only be launched by filing a complaint in accordance with the law. The court ruled that the MMDR Act and the rules made under it, as well as the 1986 Rules, are special statutes that prevail over the provisions of the Cr.P.C. The court also clarified that it had not adjudicated on the issue of civil liability arising out of excess mining of sand by the petitioner.
