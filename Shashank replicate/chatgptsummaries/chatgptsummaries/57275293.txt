The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by M/S Rachana Granites against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner is engaged in running a stone crushing unit under a valid license issued by the competent authority. The petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to quash the closure notice issued by the 2nd respondent under Section 31(A) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution Act, 1981).

The court found that the present writ action is similar to the writ action of similarly placed owners of crushing units in which questions raised in this writ petition were considered in detail in W.P.41069/12 disposed of by the Division Bench of this court on 21.11.2012. In that writ petition, the court quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and issued a writ of mandamus to permit the petitioner therein to continue stone crushing activity till its application for re-locating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority.

Based on the previous writ action, the court quashed the closure notice and allowed the petitioner to operate the stone crushing unit at the present site till such time its application is considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from now, as ordered in that writ petition.

The second court order lacks context and information, making it impossible to summarize.
