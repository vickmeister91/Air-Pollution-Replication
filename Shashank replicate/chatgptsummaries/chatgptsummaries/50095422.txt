The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act aims to protect the country's wildlife and their habitats, and to prevent their exploitation and trade. The Act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife.

Indal Singh's case is related to the violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The Act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants.

The applicant's counsel has requested bail for Indal Singh, citing his young age and lack of criminal history. Bail is a legal process that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. The grant of bail is subject to certain conditions, such as the furnishing of a bond and surety, to ensure that the accused person appears in court for trial.

The court has allowed the bail application and directed Indal Singh to furnish a bond of Rs. 25,000 and one surety bond of the same amount. A bond is a legal document that binds the accused person to appear in court for trial. A surety bond is a legal document that binds a third party to pay the bond amount if the accused person fails to appear in court for trial.

The court's decision to grant bail to Indal Singh is based on the principle of presumption of innocence. The principle of presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law that states that an accused person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The grant of bail is not a reflection of the accused person's guilt or innocence but is based on the likelihood of the accused person appearing in court for trial.

The court has also directed that the bail order will be effective until the end of the trial. This means that Indal Singh will be released from custody but will have to appear in court for trial. The trial will determine whether Indal Singh is guilty or not guilty of the charges against him.

The court has also warned Indal Singh that in case of bail jump, the bail order will become ineffective. Bail jump is a legal term that refers to the failure of an accused person to appear in court for trial after being released on bail. If Indal Singh fails to appear in court for trial, the bail order will become ineffective, and he will be liable to be arrested and taken into custody.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to the case of Indal Singh, who has been in custody since January 20, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.
