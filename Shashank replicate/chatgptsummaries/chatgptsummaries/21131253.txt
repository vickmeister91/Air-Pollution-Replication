In the first court order, Chowgule and Company Private Limited filed a case against the Joint Secretary and the State of Karnataka regarding the grant of a mining lease over an area of 359.73 hectares in Bellary District. The petitioner had previously been granted a mining lease over a reduced area of 100 hectares and had applied for relaxation under Rule 59(1) of the Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 for the remaining area. The court order details the history of the petitioner's application for renewal of the mining lease and the subsequent grant of a mining lease to a government-owned company over a portion of the same area. The petitioner had challenged the government's decision and sought quashing of the notification and recommendations issued by the government.

The court has ordered further consideration of the petitioner's application for the remaining area in accordance with the law. The court found that the government had not followed the proper procedure in granting the mining lease to the government-owned company. The court also noted that the petitioner had a legitimate expectation of being granted the mining lease for the remaining area. The court ordered that the petitioner's application for the remaining area be considered in accordance with the law.

In the second court order, a petitioner challenged a notification issued by the Central Government in favor of respondent No.3, reserving an area for prospecting or mining operations through a government company or corporation owned or controlled by the Central Government. The petitioner contended that the notification was issued in violation of sub-section (1A) of Section 17A of the MMDR Act, as there was no consultation between the Central Government and the State Government before issuing the notification in favor of respondent No.3.

However, the court found that there was no illegality pointed out by the petitioner, and the notification was issued after consultation between the two governments. Therefore, the court dismissed the writ petitions. The court found that the notification was issued in accordance with the law and that the petitioner's challenge was without merit.

In summary, the first court order pertains to a case filed by Chowgule and Company Private Limited against the Joint Secretary and the State of Karnataka regarding the grant of a mining lease over an area of 359.73 hectares in Bellary District. The court ordered further consideration of the petitioner's application for the remaining area in accordance with the law. The second court order pertains to a challenge made by a petitioner against a notification issued by the Central Government in favor of respondent No.3, reserving an area for prospecting or mining operations through a government company or corporation owned or controlled by the Central Government. The court dismissed the writ petitions, finding that the notification was issued in accordance with the law.
