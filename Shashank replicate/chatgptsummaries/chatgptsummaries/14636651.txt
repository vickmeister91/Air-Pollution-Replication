The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by N.P. Padmanabhan against the State of Kerala regarding the establishment of a quarry in Kayakodi Village. The petitioner had submitted an application for environmental clearance, which was recommended by the District Level Expert Appraisal Committee (DEAC) but not issued. The petitioner sought relief in the form of a deemed environmental clearance and a writ of mandamus to issue the physical form of the clearance. The court considered the issue of whether the petitioner was entitled to a deemed clearance and ordered further consideration of the matter.

The court has granted the petitioner the relief sought in the writ petition. The issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to a deemed EC despite orders passed by the NGT and relevant notifications issued by the Government of India will be considered. The Ministry of Environment and Forests had issued a notification making it mandatory to obtain prior EC for the construction of new projects or activities listed in the Schedule to the notification. The NGT had challenged subsequent notifications on the ground that they were inconsistent with the directions contained in Deepak Kumar's case. The NGT directed the procedure laid down in the impugned Notification to be brought in consonance and in accord with the directions contained in Deepak Kumar's case.

The court order directs the MoEF & CC to revise the procedure laid down in the impugned notification to be in conformity with the directions in Deepak Kumar's case. The SEIAA's opinion that Ext.P3 notification could still be acted upon is found to be illegal. The petitioner is not entitled to a deemed environment clearance as the recommendatory authority lacks expertise and directions have been issued to effect procedural changes. The writ petition is dismissed, and the petitioner is at liberty to work out their remedies in accordance with the procedure prescribed in the notification issued in terms of the order of the NGT dated 13.9.2018 passed in Satendra Pandey.

The court order includes exhibits P6, P7, P8, and P9, which are true copies of a proposal for technical assistance, a representation submitted by the petitioner, a proceeding from the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, and another representation submitted by the petitioner. The order is related to a writ petition filed in 2018.
