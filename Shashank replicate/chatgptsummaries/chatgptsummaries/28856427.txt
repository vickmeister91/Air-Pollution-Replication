The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Awdhesh Singh Bhadauria against the Union of India and others regarding pollution. The court entertained the petition as a Public Interest Litigation and passed some orders. However, a preliminary objection was raised by respondents No. 2 and 7 regarding the maintainability of the petition in view of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010.

The court referred to Section 14 of the Act, which states that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The court also referred to a Supreme Court decision that all matters covered under the provisions of the NGT Act and/or in Schedule I to the NGT Act shall stand transferred and can be instituted only before NGT.

The petitioner was therefore asked to avail the remedy before the National Green Tribunal, and the petition was disposed of finally with no costs.

The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 was enacted by the Indian Parliament for the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the establishment of a National Green Tribunal for the purpose of adjudicating environmental disputes and enforcing environmental laws.

The Act also provides for the establishment of State-level Green Tribunals to deal with environmental disputes at the state level. The National Green Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved.

The Act provides for the appointment of a Chairperson and other members of the Tribunal by the Central Government. The Chairperson of the Tribunal must be a retired Judge of the Supreme Court or a retired Chief Justice of a High Court.

The Tribunal has the power to hear and dispose of cases relating to environmental disputes, including disputes arising from the implementation of laws relating to water, air, and soil pollution, and the conservation of forests and other natural resources.

The Tribunal also has the power to issue orders and directions to any person, authority, or government for the protection and conservation of the environment. The Tribunal can also impose penalties and fines on any person or entity found to be violating environmental laws.

In the case at hand, the court referred to Section 14 of the National Green Tribunal Act, which provides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to the environment is involved. The court also referred to a Supreme Court decision that all matters covered under the provisions of the NGT Act and/or in Schedule I to the NGT Act shall stand transferred and can be instituted only before NGT.

The court therefore held that the petitioner should avail the remedy before the National Green Tribunal, and the petition was disposed of finally with no costs.

This decision highlights the importance of the National Green Tribunal Act in the effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The Act provides for the establishment of a specialized tribunal to deal with environmental disputes, which can help to ensure that such disputes are resolved in a timely and effective manner.

Overall, the court's decision in this case underscores the need for individuals and entities to be aware of the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act and to avail the remedy provided by the Act in cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of natural resources.
