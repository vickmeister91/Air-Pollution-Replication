Sanjeev Aggarwal had filed a revision petition to set aside an order passed by the Ld. MM in a criminal complaint against M/s Prince Eggmart & Ors. The Ld. MM had refused to direct the police to register an FIR against the respondents. Sanjeev Aggarwal claimed that seven vouchers had been forged and fabricated, and the signatures on them had been forged by the respondents in connivance with each other. The revisionist pleaded that the police investigation was required to recover the original forged vouchers and to know who else was involved in the conspiracy.

The court dismissed the revision petition, stating that the evidence required by the revisionist to prove the case was documentary in nature and already part of the judicial record. The revisionist could easily produce the same by summoning them. The court held that the revisionist had failed to make out a case for interference in the order passed by the Ld. MM.
