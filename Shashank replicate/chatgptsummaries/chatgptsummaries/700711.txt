The first court order pertains to a case where Gujarat Hotel Limited challenged an order passed by a learned Single Judge in the writ petition - Special Civil Application No. 13969 of 1993. The learned Single Judge had held that petitioner Nos.1 and 3 were liable to pay interest at the applicable rate on the outstanding amount of electricity duty, commencing from 11.11.1993 till the actual date of payment. The case of the appellant - original petitioners was that Gujarat Hotels Ltd. was promoted in the year 1982 as a joint sector Company by M/s Gujarat Industrial Investment Corporation Ltd. The joint sector Company - the 1st petitioner Company became sick for the reasons recorded in the meeting dated 4.10.1990. The aforesaid resolutions withdrawing the deferment of taxes were challenged by the petitioners by filing two writ petitions - Special Civil Application Nos. 6896 and 13969 of 1993. As noticed above, partial relief was granted by the learned Single Judge in favour of the petitioners, but no relief having granted so far as it relates to deferment of duty, the present appeal has been preferred.

The second court order discusses a case where the government of Gujarat had granted concessions to Gujarat Hotels Ltd. for deferment of taxes and electricity duty. However, the government later withdrew the concession regarding deferment of electricity duty. The court had to determine whether this withdrawal was illegal and bad in law. During the case, the government issued a new package scheme of incentives for tourism projects, which included exemptions from various taxes, including electricity duty. The court ultimately found that the government's withdrawal of the concession was legal and valid.

The third court order discusses the provisions of the Bombay Electricity Duty Act, 1958 and the Gujarat Act 8 of 1999. It states that the State Government was not authorized to defer payment of electricity duty before the amendment of the Act in 1999. The court rejected the argument that the State Government was empowered to grant deferment of electricity duty under sub-section (3) of Section 3. The court held that the appellant-petitioners were not entitled to the benefit of deferment of electricity duty and directed them to pay the duty with interest as claimed by the State.

In summary, the Gujarat Hotel Limited had challenged an order passed by a learned Single Judge in the writ petition - Special Civil Application No. 13969 of 1993. The learned Single Judge had held that petitioner Nos.1 and 3 were liable to pay interest at the applicable rate on the outstanding amount of electricity duty, commencing from 11.11.1993 till the actual date of payment. The court had to determine whether the government's withdrawal of the concession regarding deferment of electricity duty was illegal and bad in law. The court ultimately found that the government's withdrawal of the concession was legal and valid. The court also held that the appellant-petitioners were not entitled to the benefit of deferment of electricity duty and directed them to pay the duty with interest as claimed by the State.
