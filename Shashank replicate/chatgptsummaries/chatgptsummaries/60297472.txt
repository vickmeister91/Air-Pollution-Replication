The Karnataka High Court recently heard a case involving several stone crushing companies who were seeking to quash closure notices issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The court found that the case was similar to a previous case in which the closure notice was quashed and a writ of mandamus was issued to permit the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity until their application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. The court therefore followed the decision of the previous case and quashed the closure notices.

The court order directs the licensing authority to allow the petitioner to operate at their current site until their application is considered and disposed of, or until December 23, 2012. The order also states that the Pollution Control Board cannot grant permission for the petitioner to operate at their current site, as they must relocate to a safer zone. The court quashes Annexure-H dated September 5, 2012, and allows the stone crushing units of the petitioners to operate at their present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The case involved several stone crushing companies who had received closure notices from the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The companies sought to quash the notices and continue their operations at their current site until their application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. The court found that the case was similar to a previous case in which the closure notice was quashed and a writ of mandamus was issued to permit the petitioner to continue stone crushing activity until their application for relocating the unit to a safer zone was disposed of by the competent authority. The court therefore followed the decision of the previous case and quashed the closure notices.

The court order directed the licensing authority to allow the petitioner to operate at their current site until their application is considered and disposed of, or until December 23, 2012. The order also stated that the Pollution Control Board cannot grant permission for the petitioner to operate at their current site, as they must relocate to a safer zone. The court quashed Annexure-H dated September 5, 2012, and allowed the stone crushing units of the petitioners to operate at their present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority, or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the stone crushing companies had already invested a significant amount of money in their current site and that relocating to a safer zone would cause them financial hardship. The court also noted that the companies had taken steps to mitigate the environmental impact of their operations and that the Pollution Control Board had not provided any evidence to suggest that the companies were causing significant harm to the environment.

The court's decision has been welcomed by the stone crushing companies, who have argued that the closure notices were arbitrary and unjustified. The companies have also argued that they have taken steps to mitigate the environmental impact of their operations and that they are willing to comply with any reasonable conditions imposed by the Pollution Control Board.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the economic interests of businesses. While it is important to protect the environment, it is also important to ensure that businesses are not unfairly penalized for their operations. The court's decision in this case strikes a reasonable balance between these competing interests and provides a framework for future cases involving similar issues.
