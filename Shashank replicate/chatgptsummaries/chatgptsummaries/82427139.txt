The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has received several applications against various government bodies and private companies, including Ambience Developers, Bird Automotive, Home Centre, Reliance Trends, Lifestyle, Big Bazar, Parcos, Kiehl's, and Shoppers Stop, alleging violations of environmental laws and regulations while setting up a shopping mall in New Delhi. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, along with other government bodies, were responsible for overseeing the implementation of environmental policies and regulations. The companies had submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report to obtain Environmental Clearance (EC).

In another case, an individual sought clearance under environmental laws for a construction project. The project was granted an EC based on certain conditions, including the installation of a Sewage Treatment Plant and periodic monitoring of pollution levels. However, the applicant alleges that the project has violated the conditions of the EC by using areas meant for parking for commercial purposes. The court is examining the matter and the alleged violations of the EC.

In yet another case, Respondent No.9 has violated the EC and Master Plan of Delhi (MPD) Regulations by making drastic changes in construction and using more space for commercial activities than allowed. This has led to environmental hazards for the local population, including illegal extraction of underground water and misuse of the premises. Respondent No.9 argues that they have not committed any breach of the EC or EIA Report and that they are entitled to additional FAR under MPD 2021. The court has ordered an inspection of the premises and found evidence of misuse. The DDA has stated that any additional FAR cannot be allowed on already built-up and approved plots unless a policy is formulated and approved.

The court has also ordered an investigation into the misuse of space at Ambience Mall, including the use of parking areas for commercial purposes and unauthorized constructions. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee and other authorities have found deficiencies and violations of building permission rules and environmental regulations.

In another case, an inspection of a property occupied by Big Bazar Family Center found commercial activities being carried out in violation of building bye-laws. The court must determine if the application is maintainable and if Respondent No.9 has committed any violations of laws related to the environment. The NGT Act gives the Tribunal wide jurisdiction to deal with civil cases involving substantial questions relating to the environment. The court must determine if the present application falls within the scope of the NGT Act.

The court has also discussed the jurisdiction and purpose of the NGT Act, which was enacted to provide for the establishment of a tribunal for effective and expeditious disposal of cases relating to environmental protection and conservation of forests and other natural resources. The court emphasizes the importance of the preamble of the NGT Act in interpreting its provisions and outlines the jurisdiction of the tribunal, which includes hearing disputes relating to environmental protection and conservation, enforcement of legal rights relating to the environment, and awarding relief and compensation for damages to persons and property.

The court has also discussed the process of obtaining EC for building and construction projects. The EC is granted based on the project's impact on the environment, and any changes to the project's scope or use of space require a fresh appraisal by the competent authority. The court also notes that the FAR, construction, and user of space are essential considerations for EC, and any substantial alterations require a fresh EC/appraisal. The court rejects the argument that a change in FAR entitles the project proponent to use increased space for commercial purposes without permission from the competent authority.

The court has approved the extraction of underground water due to increased capacity and utilization. However, the use of basement and multi-level block for commercial operations is in violation of building guidelines and the EC granted to the project proponent. The court has jurisdiction to entertain and decide the issues raised in this application. The court rejects the plea of limitation taken up by the respondents. The present application has been filed under Section 14 of the NGT Act and is not barred by time. The court orders the revocation of the EC granted to Respondent No. 9 and the corresponding permissions granted under the Water Act and the Air Act. Penal action is directed to be taken against Respondent No. 9.

The court has also discussed an application filed under Section 14 of the NGT Act, which raises a substantial question relating to the environment and arises out of the implementation of the enactments specified in Schedule I to the NGT Act. The court considers whether the application is barred by the period of limitation prescribed under that section and examines the meaning of the expression 'cause of action.' The court concludes that the application is not barred by time and that the cause of action must have a nexus to the dispute relating to the issue of environment/substantial question relating to the environment arising out of the specified legislations to trigger the prescribed period of limitation.

The court has discussed the concept of cause of action in relation to the NGT Act. It states that the facts and situations that give a person the right to obtain an order from the Tribunal must have relevance to the essentials or pre-requisites provided under the Act to claim relief. The cause of action must relate to the environment or enforcement of any legal right relating to the environment and fall within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The order also discusses the issue of limitation and concludes that the present application is not barred by time. Finally, the court discusses the breach of conditions of an EC and whether it is likely to cause environmental
