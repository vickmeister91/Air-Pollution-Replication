The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by C.R. Neelakandan as a public interest litigation against the Union of India and various state authorities. The petitioner seeks to quash the order that constituted the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) in Kerala. The court heard arguments from both sides and issued a judgment on April 5, 2016. The judgment includes a summary of the facts of the case and the relevant clauses of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

The court order discusses the composition and eligibility criteria for members of the Sector/Project Specific Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and the State level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) for environmental impact assessments. The order specifies the eligibility criteria for professionals and experts, the composition of the committees, and the process for their appointment. The petitioner has filed a public interest litigation seeking compliance with the eligibility criteria and challenging the appointments made by the Central Government as arbitrary and illegal.

The court order directs the quashing of an order issued by the 1st respondent as arbitrary, illegal, ultra vires, irrational, unconstitutional, and in violation of the EIA Notification, 2006. It also issues a writ of quo warranto against the 5th respondent, holding that they have no authority to continue in the post of Chairman of SEIAA, and against the 6th and 7th respondents, holding that they have no authority to continue in the post of SEIAA member and Chairman of SEAC, respectively. The court also directs the appointment of appropriate mining experts to the 4th respondent body. The challenge in the writ petition is with regard to the lack of necessary qualifications of respondents 5 to 8, who hold the respective offices in SEIAA and SEAC. The court examines the scope and ambit of judicial review in a writ of quo warranto and concludes that the appointment of respondents 5 to 8 can be challenged in court if it is contrary to statutory provisions.

The court order explains that a quo warranto proceeding is a judicial remedy that allows a person to challenge the right of someone holding a public office or franchise. If the court finds that the holder of the office has no legal right to it, they can be ousted from the position. The purpose of this procedure is to prevent the Executive from making appointments to public office against the law and to protect citizens from being deprived of their rightful positions. The court must determine whether the appointment of the alleged usurper has been made in accordance with the law. The order then examines the case of Dr. K.P. Joy, who has been appointed as Chairman of SEIAA, and concludes that he fulfills the eligibility criteria for the position as defined in Appendix VI.

The court order discusses the qualifications and eligibility of various individuals appointed to the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) in Kerala. The court finds that the fifth respondent, appointed as Chairman of SEIAA, fulfills all the eligibility criteria as defined in Appendix VI, including having sufficient experience in environmental policy related issues. The sixth respondent, appointed as a member of SEIAA, also fulfills the eligibility criteria as an expert in life science and floral and faunal management. The court notes that the qualifications and experience of the seventh respondent, appointed as Chairman of SEAC, have not been challenged and that he is qualified for the position based on his experience in forestry and wildlife conservation, as well as his other professional experience. Overall, the court finds that the appointments of these individuals are valid and meet the necessary qualifications.

The court order discusses the appointment of the Chairman and members of the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) in Kerala. The petitioner challenges the eligibility of the 7th and 8th respondents to be appointed as Chairman and Expert, respectively. The court examines the qualifications and experience of the respondents and concludes that they fulfill the necessary criteria as prescribed in Appendix VI. The court also notes that there is no requirement for public advertisement for the constitution of SEIAA and SEAC. The court dismisses the petitioner's challenge and upholds the appointments.

The court order discusses a case where the appointment of a Central Vigilance Commissioner was examined under the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003. The court found that the recommendation of the High Power Committee was vitiated due to their failure to consider a pending criminal case against the incumbent. However, the present case is different, and the court found that the respondents had fulfilled all the necessary qualifications and dismissed the writ petition.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by C.R. Neelakandan challenging the constitution of the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) in Kerala. The court examined the eligibility criteria for members of the committees and the process for their appointment. The court also discussed the scope and ambit of judicial review in a writ of quo warranto and examined the qualifications and eligibility of various individuals appointed to the SEIAA and SEAC. The court found that the appointments of the individuals met the necessary qualifications and dismissed the writ petition challenging their appointments.
