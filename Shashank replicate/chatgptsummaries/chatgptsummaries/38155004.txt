The case of Sri Chandrappa vs. the State of Karnataka was brought before the court to challenge the inclusion of the petitioner's name in the rowdy sheet opened against him in the 4th respondent-police station in connection with Crime No.186/2009 of the police station. The respondents contended that the petitioner and his associates were notorious rowdies involved in real estate business and criminal activities. The petitioner was accused of murder and creating public nuisance. However, the court found that none of the grounds enumerated in Order No.1059 of the Karnataka Police Manual existed to justify the inclusion of the petitioner's name in the rowdy list.

The court observed that the inclusion of a person's name in the rowdy sheet is a serious matter as it can have serious consequences for the person's reputation and livelihood. The court noted that the purpose of the rowdy sheet is to maintain law and order and to prevent the commission of crimes by habitual offenders. The court also noted that the inclusion of a person's name in the rowdy sheet is not a punishment but a preventive measure.

The court examined the provisions of Order No.1059 of the Karnataka Police Manual which lays down the guidelines for the inclusion of a person's name in the rowdy sheet. The court noted that the guidelines require the police to have credible information about the person's involvement in criminal activities and to have taken preventive action against the person. The court also noted that the guidelines require the police to have given the person an opportunity to explain his conduct before including his name in the rowdy sheet.

The court found that none of these guidelines were followed in the case of the petitioner. The court observed that the respondents had not produced any credible evidence to show that the petitioner was involved in criminal activities. The court also observed that the respondents had not given the petitioner an opportunity to explain his conduct before including his name in the rowdy sheet. The court, therefore, held that the inclusion of the petitioner's name in the rowdy sheet was illegal and arbitrary.

The court allowed the writ petition and quashed the rowdy sheet opened against the petitioner. The court also directed the respondents to remove the petitioner's name from the rowdy sheet. The court further directed the respondents to pay a sum of Rs. 10,000/- as costs to the petitioner.

The court, however, clarified that the quashing of the rowdy sheet does not mean that the petitioner is absolved of any criminal liability. The court observed that the respondents were at liberty to take action against the petitioner if any of his activities made him fall within the definition of "rowdy" in Order No.1059 of the Karnataka Police Manual.

In conclusion, the case of Sri Chandrappa vs. the State of Karnataka highlights the importance of following the guidelines laid down in the law while taking preventive measures against habitual offenders. The court has rightly held that the inclusion of a person's name in the rowdy sheet is a serious matter and should not be done arbitrarily or without following due process. The court's decision to quash the rowdy sheet opened against the petitioner is a welcome step towards protecting the rights of citizens and upholding the rule of law.
