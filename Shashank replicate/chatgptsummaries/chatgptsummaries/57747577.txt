The court order pertains to the case of Rehana Bee, who has been in custody since July 2015 for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicant's lawyer argued that she is a woman with no criminal past and has a 10-year-old child who needs care. The prosecution alleged that the applicant's husband was the one who purchased and killed the black bucks, and that the applicant was merely a pillion rider on the motorcycle. The court allowed the applicant's bail application with a bond of Rs. 25,000 and two surety bonds of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump.

Rehana Bee's case has been a matter of concern for many, as she has been in custody for over five years. The court order allowing her bail application has brought some relief to her and her family. Her lawyer argued that she is a woman with no criminal past and has a 10-year-old child who needs care. This argument was taken into consideration by the court, which allowed her bail application.

The prosecution, on the other hand, alleged that Rehana Bee's husband was the one who purchased and killed the black bucks, and that she was merely a pillion rider on the motorcycle. However, the court did not find this argument convincing enough to deny her bail. The court's decision to grant her bail is a positive step towards ensuring that justice is served in a fair and just manner.

The court has imposed certain conditions on Rehana Bee's bail. She has to furnish a bond of Rs. 25,000 and two surety bonds of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. This means that if Rehana Bee fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of her bail, the order will become ineffective, and she will be taken back into custody.

The court's decision to grant Rehana Bee bail is a welcome move, as it recognizes the importance of ensuring that justice is served in a fair and just manner. It is important to note that bail is not a sign of guilt or innocence, but rather a means of ensuring that the accused appears in court and cooperates with the legal process. In this case, Rehana Bee has been granted bail, and it is now up to the court to decide whether she is guilty or not.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to Rehana Bee's case is a positive step towards ensuring that justice is served in a fair and just manner. The court has taken into consideration her personal circumstances and has granted her bail. It is now up to the court to decide whether she is guilty or not. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but will become ineffective in case of bail jump. It is important to note that bail is not a sign of guilt or innocence, but rather a means of ensuring that the accused appears in court and cooperates with the legal process.
