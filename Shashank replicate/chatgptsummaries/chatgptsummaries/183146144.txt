The court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner, Shri Bhupender Kumar, filed an application under Section 73/45 of the Indian Evidence Act read with Section 91 of Cr.PC. The petitioner claimed that a cheque of Rs. 2,000 he had given to the respondent, Shri Pawan Kumar, was forged as Rs. 22,000. The court dismissed the application, stating that the petitioner had not come with a clear contention as to who filled up the amount in the cheque and that there were contradictions in the petitioner's statements. The court also noted that the petitioner had delayed filing the application and had not provided sufficient justification for the delay. The revision petition was dismissed.

The case at hand involves a dispute over a cheque of Rs. 2,000 that the petitioner, Shri Bhupender Kumar, had given to the respondent, Shri Pawan Kumar. The petitioner claimed that the cheque had been forged to show a value of Rs. 22,000. In support of his claim, the petitioner filed an application under Section 73/45 of the Indian Evidence Act read with Section 91 of Cr.PC.

However, the court dismissed the application, citing several reasons. Firstly, the court noted that the petitioner had not come with a clear contention as to who filled up the amount in the cheque. This lack of clarity in the petitioner's claim weakened his case considerably. Additionally, the court found contradictions in the petitioner's statements, which further undermined his credibility.

Furthermore, the court observed that the petitioner had delayed filing the application. The court noted that the petitioner had not provided sufficient justification for the delay, which suggested that the petitioner may not have been acting in good faith. The court's decision to dismiss the application was therefore based on a combination of factors, including the lack of clarity in the petitioner's claim, the contradictions in his statements, and the delay in filing the application.

The petitioner subsequently filed a revision petition challenging the court's decision. However, the revision petition was also dismissed. The court found no reason to overturn its earlier decision, and therefore upheld the dismissal of the application.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where the petitioner claimed that a cheque he had given to the respondent had been forged. However, the court dismissed the application, citing several reasons, including the lack of clarity in the petitioner's claim, the contradictions in his statements, and the delay in filing the application. The court's decision was subsequently upheld in a revision petition.
