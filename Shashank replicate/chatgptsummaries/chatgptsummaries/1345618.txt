The case in question involved a challenge to an order passed by the Deputy Director of Consolidation, which remanded proceedings back to the Consolidation Officer. The issue at hand was the provision of 'chak nali' for irrigation of plot Nos. 257 & 259. The petitioners argued that no 'nali' can be provided for the benefit of an individual tenure-holder from their land, and that their pucca constructions standing on the land in dispute through which 'nali' is proposed is liable to be demolished.

The court, however, held that the consolidation authorities have inherent and incidental power to allot road, pathway, nali etc. to a tenure-holder, even to an individual tenure-holder, under the general power vested in them of providing chak road, pathway etc. with the view to carry out for the purpose of the Act. The court dismissed the writ petition.

The case highlights the power of consolidation authorities to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources such as roads, pathways, and nalis. The court's decision affirms the authority of these bodies to make decisions in the interest of carrying out the purposes of the Act.

It is important to note that the court's decision does not necessarily mean that the petitioners' pucca constructions will be demolished. Rather, it affirms the authority of the consolidation authorities to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources, and suggests that the petitioners may need to work with these authorities to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties involved.

Overall, the case serves as a reminder of the importance of understanding the powers and authorities of various bodies involved in land allocation and management. It also highlights the need for effective communication and collaboration between these bodies and the individuals and communities affected by their decisions.
