Ram Singh and Patiram were arrested on suspicion of committing offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and the Forest Act. They filed a second bail application, which was granted by the court on the condition that they furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each and two solvent sureties of the same amount. They were directed to remain present on each date of the trial and abide by all the terms and conditions under Section 437 of the CrPC. Failure to appear would result in automatic cancellation of their bail.

The Wild Life Protection Act and the Forest Act are two important pieces of legislation in India that aim to protect the country's wildlife and forests. These laws are designed to prevent the destruction of natural habitats, the poaching of endangered species, and other activities that can harm the environment.

Ram Singh and Patiram were arrested on suspicion of violating these laws, and they filed a second bail application in order to be released from custody. The court granted their application, but imposed several conditions on their release.

First, they were required to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000 each. This bond is a financial guarantee that they will appear in court on each date of the trial and abide by all the terms and conditions of their bail. If they fail to do so, they will forfeit the bond and may be subject to additional penalties.

In addition to the personal bond, Ram Singh and Patiram were also required to provide two solvent sureties of the same amount. These sureties are individuals who agree to pay the bond amount if Ram Singh and Patiram fail to appear in court or violate the terms of their bail.

Finally, the court directed Ram Singh and Patiram to remain present on each date of the trial and abide by all the terms and conditions under Section 437 of the CrPC. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code sets out the rules for granting bail in criminal cases, and includes provisions for ensuring that the accused appear in court and do not interfere with the investigation or prosecution of the case.

The court's decision to grant bail to Ram Singh and Patiram was based on several factors, including the nature of the charges against them, their criminal history, and the likelihood that they would flee or interfere with the investigation if released. By imposing these conditions on their release, the court sought to ensure that they would appear in court and cooperate with the legal process.

Overall, the case of Ram Singh and Patiram highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act and the Forest Act in protecting India's natural resources. These laws play a critical role in preserving the country's biodiversity and ensuring that future generations can enjoy the benefits of a healthy and sustainable environment. By enforcing these laws and holding violators accountable, the Indian legal system can help to safeguard the country's natural heritage for years to come.
