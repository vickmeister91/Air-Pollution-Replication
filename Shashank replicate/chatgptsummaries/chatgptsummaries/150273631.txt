The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. by a petitioner who sought to set aside a notice issued by the Competent Authority and SDO Forest, Tendukheda. The notice had asked the petitioner to show cause why the seized "Tendupatta" and "Bidi" should not be forfeited. The prosecution case alleged that the petitioner had procured Tendupatta in violation of provisions under Sections 5, 14, 14-A, 14-B, 14-C and 15 of the M.P. Tendupatta (Vyapar Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 1964.

The court, in its order, held that the property seized can only be confiscated under Sections 14(2) and 14(4) of the Act, 1964, when the contraventions of the provisions under Sections 5 and 9 are proved. Therefore, the show cause notice was set aside. The court clarified that it had not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case and the respondents were at liberty to proceed under Section 14(2) and 14(4) of the Act, 1964, once the violation/contravention of the Act, 1964 is proved.

The M.P. Tendupatta (Vyapar Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 1964, is a law that regulates the trade of Tendupatta in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Tendupatta is a leaf used in the manufacture of bidis, which are a type of cigarette. The law lays down various provisions for the regulation of the trade, including the licensing of traders, the regulation of prices, and the prevention of hoarding and black marketing.

The court's order is significant because it clarifies the circumstances under which property can be confiscated under the Act, 1964. The court held that the property can only be confiscated when the contraventions of the provisions under Sections 5 and 9 are proved. This means that the authorities cannot confiscate property merely on the basis of a suspicion or allegation of contravention. They must first prove that the contravention has actually taken place.

The court's order also highlights the importance of due process in the enforcement of laws. The court held that the show cause notice issued by the Competent Authority and SDO Forest, Tendukheda, was not valid because it did not follow the due process of law. The notice had asked the petitioner to show cause why the seized property should not be forfeited, without first proving that the petitioner had contravened the provisions of the Act, 1964. The court's order ensures that the authorities cannot bypass due process and confiscate property without first proving that a contravention has taken place.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case clarifies the circumstances under which property can be confiscated under the M.P. Tendupatta (Vyapar Viniyaman) Adhiniyam, 1964. The court held that property can only be confiscated when the contraventions of the provisions under Sections 5 and 9 are proved. The court's order also highlights the importance of due process in the enforcement of laws and ensures that the authorities cannot bypass due process and confiscate property without first proving that a contravention has taken place.
