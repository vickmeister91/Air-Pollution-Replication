The court order in question relates to a bail application filed by two individuals in connection with an FIR registered under the Prohibition Act. The court allowed the bail application for one of the applicants, Lokesh, on the grounds that he had no prior criminal record and there were no special circumstances against him. However, the court imposed certain conditions on Lokesh's bail, including a personal bond and surety, surrendering his passport, and reporting to the police station every alternate Monday. The court also warned that if any of the conditions were breached, appropriate action would be taken.

The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain areas. It is a strict law that is enforced rigorously, and violations can result in severe penalties. In this case, Lokesh and another individual were accused of violating the Prohibition Act, and an FIR was registered against them.

Lokesh filed a bail application in court, seeking release from custody while the case was ongoing. The court considered his application and granted him bail, taking into account his lack of prior criminal record and the absence of any special circumstances against him. However, the court also imposed certain conditions on his bail to ensure that he did not abscond or interfere with the investigation.

The conditions imposed on Lokesh's bail were as follows:

1. Personal bond and surety: Lokesh was required to furnish a personal bond and surety to the court, guaranteeing that he would comply with the conditions of his bail.

2. Surrendering passport: Lokesh was required to surrender his passport to the court, to prevent him from leaving the country while the case was ongoing.

3. Reporting to police station: Lokesh was required to report to the police station every alternate Monday, to ensure that he remained in contact with the authorities and did not abscond.

The court warned Lokesh that if he breached any of these conditions, appropriate action would be taken against him. This could include revocation of his bail and re-arrest, as well as other penalties.

The court's decision to grant bail to Lokesh while imposing conditions is not uncommon in criminal cases. Bail is a legal right, and courts are often willing to grant it to accused persons who are not considered a flight risk or a danger to society. However, courts also have a duty to ensure that accused persons do not abscond or interfere with the investigation, and may impose conditions on bail to ensure compliance.

In this case, the court's decision to grant bail to Lokesh while imposing conditions was a balanced one, taking into account his lack of prior criminal record and the absence of any special circumstances against him. The conditions imposed were reasonable and designed to ensure that he did not abscond or interfere with the investigation.

Overall, the court's order in this case is a reminder of the importance of complying with the law, particularly in cases involving strict laws such as the Prohibition Act. While accused persons have legal rights, they also have a responsibility to comply with the conditions of their bail and cooperate with the authorities. Failure to do so can result in severe penalties, including revocation of bail and re-arrest.
