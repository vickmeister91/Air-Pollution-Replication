The Supreme Court of India recently granted leave in the case of Panna Lal and others, who were charged with killing a Neelgaya and distributing its flesh, which is a crime under the Wild Life Protection Act. The trial court had convicted the appellants and sentenced them to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. The district and sessions judge dismissed their appeal, and the High Court dismissed their criminal revision petition as time-barred due to a delay of 205 days. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's order and directed it to decide the criminal revision petition on its merits. The appellants' request for bail was referred to the High Court.

The case of Panna Lal and others is a significant one as it involves the killing of a protected animal, which is a serious offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The trial court had found the appellants guilty of the crime and sentenced them to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000. However, the appellants had appealed against the conviction, and their appeal was dismissed by the district and sessions judge. They had then filed a criminal revision petition in the High Court, which was dismissed as time-barred due to a delay of 205 days.

The Supreme Court's decision to grant leave in the case is significant as it indicates that the court is willing to review the lower courts' decisions in cases involving the Wild Life Protection Act.
