The court order pertains to a case where the State of Karnataka appointed Sri N. Bhoomanand Manay as Chairman of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board in a casual vacancy caused by the relinquishing of office by the previous Chairman. The court found that the first respondent was entitled to hold office until a duly appointed successor entered upon his office, and therefore his premature ouster from the office of Chairman of the Board was illegal. However, the court did not agree with the view that the first respondent was entitled to continue for a period of three years, as his tenure as Chairman of the Board was governed by the statutory provision which prescribed a specified period.

The court order discusses the tenure of the first respondent as Chairman of the Board and the validity of his appointment. The court disagrees with the view taken by the learned single judge and finds force in the contention that the government could terminate the appointment of the first respondent at any time. An interim order was passed staying the operation of the learned single judge's order, and a successor was appointed as Chairman of the State Pollution Control Board. The court sets aside the impugned judgment to the extent that it prevented the respondents from appointing another person as Chairman of the Board in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
