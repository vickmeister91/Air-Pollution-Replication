The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various cases related to the establishment of commercial units in residential areas and the violation of laws and regulations related to pollution control, building bye-laws, and planning standards. In the case of Dr. S.S. Narnoly vs State of Jharkhand & Ors., the petitioner sought a declaration that certain licenses and orders granted to a commercial complex in a residential area were illegal and unconstitutional due to sound and air pollution caused by the complex. The petitioner also argued that the complex violated the Ranchi Master Plan, which was created for planned development of the city area. The court order provided background information on the case and the relevant laws and regulations.

In another case, a resident of Ranchi filed a petition against a car servicing, repairing, denting, and painting workshop set up in a residential area. The petitioner alleged that the workshop was an industrial set up and violated various pollution control laws and building bye-laws. The petitioner also alleged that the workshop caused pollution and health hazards to the residents of the area. The respondent denied the allegations and claimed that the petitioner had a personal rivalry with them. The court was asked to declare the NOCs, consent orders, and license granted to the respondent as illegal and unconstitutional and to direct the authorities to declare the respondent's unit as running in contravention of the relevant laws and bye-laws.

In another case, a petitioner filed a complaint against a respondent for unauthorized construction and running a commercial unit in a residential area. The respondent argued that they had obtained all necessary permissions and inspections had found no violations. The court found that the respondent had followed due process and granted permission in accordance with the law. The court also noted that the petitioner's complaint was motivated by personal grudges and dismissed the petition. Supplementary affidavits were filed by both parties, and subsequent developments were brought to the court's attention.

In yet another case, the petitioners were allowed to seek an alternative remedy through the civil court. The case involved a dispute between the petitioner and respondent no.6 over the establishment of an automobile dealership showroom in a residential area. The respondent had obtained permission from all departments for the establishment of the unit, but the petitioner argued that it may create nuisance, pollution, or other hazards in the locality. The court considered the submissions of both parties and concluded that the issues raised in the petition were substantially of law and not in dispute, except for the interpretation of reports.
