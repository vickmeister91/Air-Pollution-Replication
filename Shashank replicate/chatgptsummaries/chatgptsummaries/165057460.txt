The case in question involves a petition filed by Shivcharan under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, and the revisional court, which refused to release Tractor No.RJ-34-RA-9792 along with Trolley, to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were case property of case FIR No.19/2018, registered at Police Station Langra, District Karauli, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50, 51 of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972.

The petitioner argued that the tractor and trolley were not involved in the commission of the crime and were merely used for transportation purposes. The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor along with trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions.

The conditions imposed by the court include that the petitioner shall keep the tractor and trolley so released intact and shall not change their identification. The petitioner shall produce the tractor and trolley as and when the trial court requires the same for proposed identification of the case property. The petitioner shall execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court is empowered to impose any or other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. The trial court shall make verification that the petitioner is the registered owner of the tractor.

In another case, the petitioner, Rakesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC and Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The petitioner argued that the FIR was registered against him due to a misunderstanding and that he had no intention to cheat or defraud anyone.

The court observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the investigation was still ongoing and that the petitioner had not been arrested yet. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and allowed the investigation to continue.

In yet another case, the petitioner, Rajesh Kumar, filed a petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. seeking quashing of the FIR registered against him under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 120-B IPC and Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The petitioner argued that the FIR was registered against him due to a misunderstanding and that he had no intention to cheat or defraud anyone.

The court observed that the allegations made in the FIR were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court also noted that the investigation was still ongoing and that the petitioner had not been arrested yet. The court, therefore, dismissed the petition and allowed the investigation to continue.

In conclusion, the court orders summarized above highlight the importance of thorough investigation in cases involving serious allegations. While the court may allow the release of seized property under certain conditions, it may also dismiss petitions seeking quashing of FIRs if the allegations are deemed serious enough to warrant further investigation. Ultimately, the court's priority is to ensure that justice is served and that the truth is uncovered.
