The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first case, filed by WLI Aarti Singh against Arif Qureshi, involved the illegal dealing of Shahtoosh shawls made from Tibetan Antelope/Chiru's wool, which is a scheduled animal specified in Schedule-I of the Act. The accused was found guilty and convicted on June 2, 2015, for contravening relevant provisions of the Act. The offence was committed on November 18, 1996, and the complaint was filed on October 30, 2002. The court examined three witnesses, and the accused pleaded not guilty. However, the court found the accused guilty of violating the Act.

The second court order prohibits dealing in musk deer musk or rhinoceros horn without written permission from the Chief Wild Life Warden or authorized officer. It also prohibits dealing in animal articles, taxidermy, trophies, captive animals, and meat without a license. The order further prohibits the purchase of captive or wild animals or animal articles without going through a licensed dealer or authorized person. The case discussed involves an accused individual who was found with case property related to wildlife, and the prosecution argued that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The defense argued that the accused was innocent and had been falsely implicated. The court noted minor contradictions and discrepancies in witness testimony but ultimately found the accused's defense to be unconvincing.

The third court order discusses various arguments made by the defense in a case involving the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused had been arrested for possession of shawls made from the wool of a scheduled animal. The defense argued that the accused's signatures on the seizure memo were obtained on blank paper, that the case property was not linked to the accused, and that the presence of prosecution witnesses was doubtful. The court rejected these arguments, stating that the accused had not taken appropriate legal action if his signatures were obtained on blank paper, that the raid and seizure had been proved, and that the non-joining of public witnesses was not fatal to the prosecution case. The court also noted that the accused's claim of being falsely implicated did not have any substance.

The fourth court order, referenced as "AIR 1988 SC 1998," states that the accused in the case failed to provide any evidence to disprove the prosecution's story and did not explain why they were falsely implicated. The court also cites a presumption of unlawful possession in cases related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act and finds the accused guilty of contravening the act by possessing Shahtoosh shawls without a permit or license. The case property is to be confiscated to the state, and the accused will be heard on sentencing on a later date.

In summary, all of these court orders involve violations of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the accused individuals were found guilty of contravening relevant provisions of the Act. The court orders highlight the importance of protecting scheduled animals and the consequences of violating the Act. The court orders also emphasize the need for proper legal action and evidence to support claims made by the defense. Ultimately, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of wildlife conservation and the need to enforce laws that protect endangered species.
