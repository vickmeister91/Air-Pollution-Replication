The recent court order has reiterated the decision of the Apex Court in the cases of Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal versus Union of India and Anr. and Krishnakant Tamrakar Versus The State of Madhya Pradesh, which states that lawyers do not have the right to go on strike or boycott courts. This decision has been made in the context of a bail application filed by a petitioner under Section 439 Cr.P.C. for an offense under Sections 379, 308, 120B I.P.C. and Section 29/51 of Wild Life Protection Act.

The petitioner had been absconding since 2012, and the court rejected the bail application on this basis. The court also directed the trial court to expedite the disposal of the case, which pertains to transportation of Bajri. This decision is significant as it reaffirms the importance of timely and efficient disposal of cases, and highlights the negative impact that strikes and boycotts by lawyers can have on the functioning of the justice system.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of justice and fairness, as it ensures that cases are heard and decided in a timely manner, and that the rights of all parties involved are protected. The right to a fair trial is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution of India, and any action that undermines this right is a serious violation of the law.

The court's decision also sends a strong message to lawyers and legal professionals, reminding them of their responsibilities and obligations towards the justice system. Lawyers play a crucial role in ensuring that justice is served, and any action that disrupts the functioning of the courts can have serious consequences for the administration of justice.

In conclusion, the recent court order reaffirms the importance of timely and efficient disposal of cases, and highlights the negative impact that strikes and boycotts by lawyers can have on the functioning of the justice system. The decision is in line with the principles of justice and fairness, and sends a strong message to lawyers and legal professionals about their responsibilities and obligations towards the justice system. It is hoped that this decision will serve as a reminder to all stakeholders about the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served.
