The court order in question is related to a writ petition filed by Naseer Joinery Laloo, who runs a wood-based industrial unit in Laloo, Shishgari Bagh, Hyderpora, Budgam. The petitioner's maternal uncle has filed complaints with the Pollution Control Board (PCB) stating that the unit is causing serious noise pollution, and the PCB has issued two notices directing the petitioner to take necessary remedial measures failing which legal action would be taken.

The court has granted the petitioner two weeks' time to approach the Regional Director, J&K State Pollution Control Board with an application and request appropriate instructions from the Authority as to what are the pollution control methods to be adopted and accordingly implemented.
