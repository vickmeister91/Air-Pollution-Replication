In 1996, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgment in response to a public interest petition against tanneries located in the city of Kanpur. The scope of the petition was later expanded to include industries located in various cities on the banks of River Ganga. The judgment specifically addressed the tanneries located at Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia, and Pagla Danga in the eastern fringe of the city of Calcutta. The tanneries were found to be operating in extreme unhygienic conditions and discharging highly toxic effluents into the environment. The State of West Bengal and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board were found to be remiss in their statutory obligations to control pollution and stop environmental degradation. The court ordered the relocation of the Calcutta tanneries and the acquisition of land for a new tanneries' complex.

The court order directed the Minister-in-charge of the Cottage and Small-Scale Industries Department to proceed with a project to relocate tanneries to a new complex within a specific time frame. The project must be entrusted to a technical authority for preparation within two months, and land acquisition proceedings must begin within one month. After the land is acquired, the State Government must develop it within three months. The court will monitor progress, and any violation of the order will result in contempt of court charges. The court has issued multiple orders and notices to ensure compliance with the project. The cost of land and the construction of an effluent treatment plant are also discussed.

The court order also discussed the inclusion of the Tanneries' Project in West Bengal in the Ganga Action Plan and the allocation of funds for the project. The Ministry of Environment and Forests was directed to find a way to fund the project and file a fresh affidavit within three weeks. The court agreed to include the project in the Ganga Action Plan, Phase II, and directed the State of West Bengal to prepare and send a project proposal for the common effluent treatment plant for the tanneries to the Ganga Project Directorate. The tanneries were given a deadline to deposit 25% of the price of land for relocation to the new complex. The court also ordered the Labour Commissioner to survey the area and find out how many tannery-owners were residing within the tannery premises. The court further directed NEERI to examine the project prepared by KROFTA for setting up a common effluent treatment plant at the existing location in Tangra.

The court ordered Dr. P. Khanna to appoint a team of experts to examine the viability and feasibility of a project prepared by KROFTA. The team would determine if the project could be constructed without interfering with the normal life of residents and if it could control pollution and odour. The NEERI team would also consult with the West Bengal Pollution Control Board and the West Bengal Government. The court had been monitoring the pollution caused by Calcutta tanneries and had ordered their relocation to a new complex. The court had rejected the tanneries' claim that the new complex was part of a wetland. The tanneries were operating in violation of the Water Act, and the court had taken steps to facilitate their relocation.

The court order required Calcutta tanneries to obtain consent from the Board before discharging trade effluent into a stream or on land. The tanneries that had not obtained consent were liable to be prosecuted under the Water Act. The court ordered the tanneries to relocate to a new leather complex set up by the West Bengal Government and deposit 25% of the land price before 28-2-1997. The tanneries failing to deposit the amount would be closed on 15-4-1997. The court imposed a pollution fine of Rs. 10,000 each on all the tanneries in the four areas of Tangra, Tiljala, Topsia, and Pagla Danga. The compensation amount recovered from the polluting tanneries and the amount of fine recovered from the tanneries would be deposited under a separate head called "Environment Protection Fund" and would be utilized for restoring the damaged environment and ecology. The workmen employed in the Calcutta tanneries would be entitled to certain rights and benefits.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgment in 1996 against tanneries located in the city of Kanpur, which was later expanded to include industries located in various cities on the banks of River Ganga. The tanneries were found to be operating in extreme unhygienic conditions and discharging highly toxic effluents into the environment. The court ordered the relocation of the Calcutta tanneries and the acquisition of land for a new tanneries' complex. The court issued multiple orders and notices to ensure compliance with the project, and the cost of land and the construction of an effluent treatment plant were also discussed. The court also ordered the tanneries to obtain consent from the Board before discharging trade effluent into a stream or on land and imposed a pollution fine on all the tanneries in the four areas. The compensation amount recovered from the polluting tanneries and the amount of fine recovered from the tanneries would be deposited under a separate head called "Environment Protection Fund" and would be utilized for restoring the damaged environment and ecology.
