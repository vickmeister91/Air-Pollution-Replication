The National Green Tribunal received an application from the Society for Environmental Protection against the establishment of a coal-based Thermal Power Plant Project in Amravati, Maharashtra. The project allegedly would destroy the environment and deprive farmers of irrigation facilities. The applicant requested a writ of certiorari to stop the project and reconsider the permission granted to the power plant. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, the Irrigation Department, the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, and M/s Indiabull Power Ltd were named as respondents.

The Respondent No.5 argued that the issue of water allocation had already been settled by the Hon'ble High Court. The court order states that the allocation of water to the power plant of Indiabulls Power Limited was not against the law or arbitrary. The respondent has obtained various permissions from statutory authorities and has invested a huge amount in the project's development. The court also mentions that the issue of water allocation cannot be challenged now as it has already been settled by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court.

The court also discusses the MPCB's findings on the power plant's pollution control systems and stack emissions. The MPCB has sent necessary communication to the respondent to take effective steps to secure compliance with the standards. The respondent has highlighted discrepancies in the sampling and analysis conducted by the MPCB and has brought them to the notice of the MPCB. The MPCB has decided to constitute a committee to deal with the issue.

The court order includes several directives related to the monitoring and analysis of stack emissions from a thermal power plant. The court orders that certain samples should be discarded due to delays in submission and analysis, and directs the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to conduct joint sampling of the stack of Unit No.1 to ensure compliance with emission standards. The MPCB is also directed to arrange training for field officers and laboratory personnel to ensure scientific monitoring and analysis of stack samples.

The court also considers issues related to public consultation and the interpretation of regulations regarding exemption from public hearings. The court determines that the application is within limitation and should be proceeded with. The court states that the application will be proceeded with, but the issue of water allocation has already been settled by a previous court order. The respondent argues that they have received necessary permissions and have invested a large amount of money in their project. The court expresses concern about compliance with specific conditions related to pollution control and water usage. The court notes flaws in the monitoring and analysis conducted by the regulatory bodies and expects them to take action in the next six months.

The court order instructs the MPCB to consider a report from an expert committee within the next six months to regulate industrial emissions and monitor environmental quality. The court also orders a comprehensive compliance monitoring of a specific industry by the MoEF and MPCB to ensure compliance with consent conditions. The court discusses the interpretation of an exemption clause in the EIA Notification, 2006, regarding public consultation for projects located within industrial areas and parks. The court emphasizes the importance of public consultation and the interpretation of the exemption clause for clarity. The court also discusses the methods of interpreting statutes and concludes that the legislature had considered industrial estates and parks listed in Item 7(c) of the EIA Notification when granting the exemption.

The court order discusses the interpretation of the EIA Notification and the exemption from public consultation for projects located within industrial estates or parks. The court agrees with the MoEF's stand that the exemption is only available for projects that have obtained environmental clearance under the EIA Notification and are located within industrial estates or parks. The court also emphasizes the importance of public consultation in the EIA process and directs the MoEF to issue immediate directions to concerned authorities regarding the applicability of the exemption. The order also directs the MPCB to take necessary action for improvement in sampling and monitoring mechanisms.

The court order requires the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to conduct an inspection of a specific industry within the next three months to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The MoEF must also assess the cumulative impacts of thermal power plants in the surrounding areas. The MoEF and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) are required to regularly inspect the industry and take appropriate action if there is non-compliance. The court has disposed of the application and no costs are to be paid. A status report must be submitted to the Tribunal in three months.

In summary, the court order deals with an application against the establishment of a coal-based Thermal Power Plant Project in Amravati, Maharashtra. The court discusses issues related to water allocation, pollution control, and public consultation. The court orders the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to conduct joint sampling of the stack of Unit No.1 to ensure compliance with emission standards and to arrange training for field officers and laboratory personnel to ensure scientific monitoring and analysis of stack samples. The court also orders a comprehensive compliance monitoring of a specific industry by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and MPCB to ensure compliance with consent conditions. The court emphasizes the importance of public consultation in the EIA process and directs the MoEF to issue immediate directions to concerned authorities regarding the applicability of the exemption. The court requires the MoEF to conduct an inspection of a specific industry within the next three months to ensure compliance with environmental regulations and assess the cumulative impacts of thermal power plants in the surrounding areas.
