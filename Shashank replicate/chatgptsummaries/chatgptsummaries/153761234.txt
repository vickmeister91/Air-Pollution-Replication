The Madras High Court has issued a court order pertaining to Criminal Original Petitions filed by M/S.Ramaraj Trading Company and other companies seeking an interim stay of all further proceedings in C.C.No.36 of 1998 pending disposal of the above petitions. The Trial Court had dismissed their petitions to reopen the defence evidence and call the Chief Manager of Indian Bank to appear before the court for giving evidence as defence witnesses. The court has directed the Trial Court to consider the documents filed by the petitioners for their defence while deciding the case in accordance with the law.

The court order was issued on January 8, 2019, and addressed to the Inspector of Police, CBI/EOW/Chennai, the Chief Manager of Asset Recovery Management Branch, Indian Bank, and the Public Prosecutor of the High Court of Madras. The order was made based on submissions made by the Special Public Prosecutor.

The court has ordered the Trial Court to consider a memo and letter filed by the defense side, along with other documents, for rendering judgment in a specific case in accordance with the law.

The case pertains to allegations of fraud and misappropriation of funds by the companies, which had taken loans from the Indian Bank. The bank had filed a complaint against the companies in 1998, and the case has been pending in the Trial Court since then.

The companies had filed petitions in the High Court seeking an interim stay of all further proceedings in the Trial Court pending disposal of their petitions.
