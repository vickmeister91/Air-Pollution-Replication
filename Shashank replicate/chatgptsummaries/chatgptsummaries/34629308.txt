The Patna High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Vinod Singh and Ram Lakhan Saw, who were apprehending arrest in connection with a case registered under Sections 379, 411 and 420/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 4 and 40 of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules and 15 of the Pollution Control Act. The court found that the petitioners had a valid license for transporting sand and ordered their release on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned CJM, Aurangabad.

The case against the petitioners was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Mining Officer, Aurangabad, alleging that the petitioners were transporting sand without a valid license and in violation of the provisions of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules and the Pollution Control Act. The complaint further alleged that the petitioners had committed theft of sand and had dishonestly disposed of the same.

The petitioners, on the other hand, contended that they had a valid license for transporting sand and that they had not committed any theft or dishonest disposal of sand. They further contended that the case against them was false and frivolous and was filed with a mala fide intention to harass them.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court found that the petitioners had a valid license for transporting sand and that there was no evidence to suggest that they had committed theft or dishonest disposal of sand. The court also noted that the case against the petitioners was filed after a delay of several months and that there was no explanation for the delay.

In light of these findings, the court granted anticipatory bail to the petitioners and ordered their release on bail upon furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000/- each with two sureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the learned CJM, Aurangabad. The court also directed the petitioners to cooperate with the investigation and to appear before the investigating officer as and when required.

This decision of the Patna High Court is significant as it highlights the importance of having a valid license for transporting sand and the need for strict compliance with the provisions of the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession Rules and the Pollution Control Act. It also emphasizes the need for the police to conduct a thorough investigation before filing a case against an accused and to ensure that there is sufficient evidence to support the allegations made in the complaint.
