The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard two petitions filed by M/s. Daawat Foods Limited and Rajendra Kumar Wadhwan, a director of the company, seeking the quashment of proceedings against them for violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the M.P. Pollution Control Board. The court found that there was no specific averment against the accused no.2, who is the petitioner in M.Cr.C. No.5675/2011, in relation to the manner in which he is responsible for the affairs of the company, which is a fatal flaw.

The court order discusses a case involving the violation of the Water Act and the prosecution of the petitioners. The court considers arguments made by both the petitioners and the respondent, including issues related to the requirements for prosecution under the Act, the delegation of power to file cases, and the mens rea of knowledge required for the offences. The court ultimately concludes that the complaint against the petitioners is maintainable and that the inherent power to quash a criminal proceeding should only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.

In another case, the court order discusses a case where a company was accused of violating provisions of the Water Act. The court found that the incident was an accident and beyond the control of the company, and that there was no evidence of knowledge or intent to violate the law. The court also found that the director of the company could not be prosecuted without specific allegations of responsibility, and that the company could be fined but not imprisoned. The court emphasized the need for careful consideration before summoning an accused in a criminal case.

The court order states that the petitioner can approach the High Court to have proceedings quashed against them if the complaint does not make out any case against them. The court found that the filing of the complaint case against the petitioner was completely uncalled for and resulted in an abuse of process. The court also rejected the contention that the rupture of the underground pipeline was due to negligence on the part of the petitioner-company. As a result, the petitions are allowed and the proceedings against the petitioners in Sessions Trial No.223/2011 pending in the Court of the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Raisen is quashed.
