The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a petitioner against the order of the second respondent dismissing their appeal for non-compliance of pre-deposit as per Section 35F of the Central Excise Act, 1944. The petitioner had presented the appeal within time but did not make the pre-deposit along with the appeal. The Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras had already considered a similar case and concluded that an appeal presented within time cannot be rejected solely on the ground that the mandatory pre-deposit was not made before the expiry of the period of limitation. Therefore, the writ petition was allowed, and the order passed by the second respondent was set aside.

The second court order states that the court has allowed a writ petition and set aside an order passed by the second respondent. The matter is remitted back to the second respondent to take up the appeal and pass orders on the same on merits and in accordance with the law. The second respondent is given six weeks to pass such an order. No costs are involved.

In summary, the petitioner had filed an appeal within the stipulated time but had not made the pre-deposit along with the appeal. The second respondent had dismissed the appeal on the grounds of non-compliance of pre-deposit. However, the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Madras had already ruled that an appeal presented within time cannot be rejected solely on the ground that the mandatory pre-deposit was not made before the expiry of the period of limitation. Therefore, the writ petition was allowed, and the order passed by the second respondent was set aside.

The court has remitted the matter back to the second respondent to take up the appeal and pass orders on the same on merits and in accordance with the law. The second respondent has been given six weeks to pass such an order, and no costs are involved. This court order highlights the importance of complying with the pre-deposit requirements while filing an appeal, but also emphasizes that an appeal presented within time cannot be rejected solely on the grounds of non-compliance of pre-deposit.
