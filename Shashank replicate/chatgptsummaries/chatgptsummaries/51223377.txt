The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently received a petition from M/s. Parle Agro Private Ltd. and Ashok Bhave, Director of the company, to quash a complaint registered against them and one Manish Kumar by the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The complaint alleged that the company was violating provisions of the Air and Water Acts by running a factory without proper permissions and not maintaining necessary conditions. The Chief Judicial Magistrate had registered the complaint and issued notices to the accused, prompting the petitioners to file a criminal revision.

The court has ordered the accused persons to appear in court. The petitioners have filed a criminal revision and a petition for quashment of the complaint and subsequent proceedings. The respondent had granted consent to petitioner No.1 to run the factory, but violations of the provisions of the Acts were found during inspections. The court found that the respondent has no authority to cancel the license of petitioner No.1 and can only prosecute the violator(s). The court has examined the record and found no compelling circumstances to quash the proceedings. The complaint prima facie discloses the offences committed by the petitioners.

The court order states that the complaint against the petitioners cannot be quashed as it prima facie discloses the offenses committed by them. The court cites various principles of law for quashing FIRs/complaints/investigations and subsequent criminal proceedings and finds that not a single ground is made out by the petitioners to quash the complaint and the subsequent proceedings in the case. The petition is dismissed, and the interim order passed by the court stands vacated. The status of petitioner No.2 as the occupier of the factory is not decided finally in this order, and he has the liberty to challenge his said status in the course of the trial of the case.
