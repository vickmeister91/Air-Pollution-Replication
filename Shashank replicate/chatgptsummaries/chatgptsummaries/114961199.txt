The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by S. Asirvatham Daniel seeking permission to conduct prayer meetings in his residential house on Sundays and Christian festivals. The petitioner claims that he has been unlawfully prevented from exercising his fundamental right to practice his religion. The Revenue Divisional Officer had previously allowed him to conduct prayers with family members without causing hindrance to the public. However, the court notes that while freedom of religion is a fundamental right, it is subject to public order, morality, and health. 

The court cites a previous case where it was observed that no religion prescribes or preaches that prayers are required to be performed through voice amplifiers or by beating of drums, and that such practices should not adversely affect the rights of others. The court states that no rights in an organized society can be absolute and the enjoyment of one's rights must be consistent with the enjoyment of rights by others. Rules for the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers are required to be enforced to control noise pollution. 

The court also mentions that there is no need to get prior permission from any authority for assembling and conducting prayers in a dwelling place without causing nuisance or disturbance to others and without causing hindrance to the general public. However, the petitioner is bound to ensure that no hindrance or disturbance is caused to the general public while conducting prayers in his residential premises. The writ petition is disposed with these observations.

On June 14, 2019, a court order was issued to the District Collector, Nagapattinam District, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Mayiladudurai, the Tahsildar, Seerkazhi, and the Inspector Police, Thiruvengadu Police Station, Thiruvengadu, Nagapattinam District.

The court order highlights the importance of balancing the fundamental right to practice religion with the rights of others in an organized society. While the petitioner has the right to conduct prayers in his residential premises, he must ensure that it does not cause hindrance or disturbance to the general public. The court also emphasizes the need to enforce rules for the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers to control noise pollution.

It is important to note that no religion prescribes or preaches that prayers must be performed through voice amplifiers or by beating of drums. Therefore, such practices should not adversely affect the rights of others. The court's observations serve as a reminder that no rights in an organized society can be absolute and the enjoyment of one's rights must be consistent with the enjoyment of rights by others.

The court order also highlights the need for authorities to issue clear guidelines on the use of loudspeakers and voice amplifiers to control noise pollution. This is particularly important in residential areas where the use of such equipment can cause disturbance to the general public.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder of the importance of balancing individual rights with the rights of others in an organized society. While individuals have the right to practice their religion, they must ensure that it does not cause hindrance or disturbance to the general public. The authorities also have a responsibility to enforce rules and guidelines to control noise pollution and protect the rights of all individuals in the community.
