In the first court order, the petitioners in Writ Petition No. 333/93 had filed an application for stay regarding the construction of Palm Hotel by respondent No. 7. The petitioners claimed that the hotel project was in violation of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and its Rules. The petitioners filed an application for urgent final hearing of the petition, and an interim report was given by the Ministry of Environment, which established that the hotel project was in total violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification. However, the court rejected the application for stay, as the location of the hotel project was not along the coastline or shoreline of the state, but instead along the bank of the river Mandovi. The Supreme Court also refused to interfere with the court's order, and advised the petitioners to take whatever steps are available in law and approach the High Court for getting adequate remedy if any construction elsewhere was being proceeded contrary to the Notification issued by the Government of India.

In the second court order, the petitioner's counsel cited various legal precedents, but the court concluded that none of them supported the petitioner's case. The court noted that the dismissal of a special leave petition by a non-speaking order does not necessarily imply rejection of the contentions raised in the petition, but this ruling was not applicable to the present case. The court also cited a ruling that the dismissal of one writ petition in limine implies that another writ petition on the same issue cannot be maintained unless new facts have arisen. The court concluded that the petitioner had not presented any new facts that would justify reopening the issues already settled by the Supreme Court. The court also considered a recent Supreme Court judgment but concluded that it did not apply to constructions that have already been cleared by the concerned authorities. The court dismissed the petitioner's application with no order as to costs.

In summary, the first court order dealt with an application for stay regarding the construction of Palm Hotel, which was found to be in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification. However, the court rejected the application for stay as the location of the hotel project was not along the coastline or shoreline of the state. The second court order dealt with a petitioner's application to reopen issues already settled by the Supreme Court, but the court concluded that the petitioner had not presented any new facts that would justify reopening the issues.
