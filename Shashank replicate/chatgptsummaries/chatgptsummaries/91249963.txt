The court order pertains to multiple cases related to mining activities of English India Clays Limited. The cases include challenges to orders passed by the District Collector under the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, seeking police protection for mining and transportation of china clay, and seeking interdiction of mining activities for lack of prior Environmental Clearance. The court also considers a writ petition filed by the Company for expeditious consideration of their application for Environmental Clearance. The court heard all the cases and delivered a judgment on October 4, 2018.

In one of the cases, a mining company was allowed to carry on mining activities provisionally without obtaining an Environmental Clearance (EC) due to a recommendation issued by the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC). The court heard arguments from both sides, with the company arguing that they had commenced mining activities before the requirement for an EC and that they had followed all necessary sanctions and approvals. The petitioners argued that the mining activities had been carried out illegally and without an impact assessment, and that the mining should be stopped and the value of minerals extracted recovered from the company. The court ultimately allowed the company to continue mining provisionally, subject to final decision by the SEIAA.

In another case, 12 connected cases related to mining activities carried out by a company without obtaining prior environmental clearance (EC) were discussed. The court found that the company had purchased 26.6 acres of land out of the total lease area of 35 acres and had commenced mining activities only in the area it owned. The court also notes that the company had not obtained an EC for mining activities beyond 5 hectares, as required by the notification of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The court further observes that the company had suppressed information about pending litigation before the Division Bench on the same subject matter. The court orders the company to obtain an EC and dismisses the writ petitions.

In yet another case, a mining company had commenced operations without obtaining a prior Environmental Clearance (EC) as mandated by the EIA notification. The company had a lease for 35 acres of land, but only owned 26.6 acres. The court found that the mining activity carried out by the company was illegal and attracted the rigour of the judgment in Common Cause. The court also referred to photographs produced by the petitioner, which indicated large-scale mining had been done in the area adjacent to which, at least in one photograph, there was seen lush growth of greenery. The court found that the entire activity carried out by the company was illegal and required a prior EC.

The court also discussed violations by a company in relation to environmental protection laws. The company was found to have commenced mining operations without obtaining prior environmental clearance and without obtaining consent from all landowners. The court also notes the lackadaisical attitude of government officers in enforcing environmental protection laws. The court order cites various exhibits and studies to support its findings.

The court noted the serious environmental problems caused by mining operations in the area, including the conversion of paddy lands, deepening of mine pits, and drainage of groundwater resources. The court notes that despite reports of environmental damage, the mining company was allowed to continue its operations without proper permits. The court also criticizes the government for failing to take action to stop the mining activities. The court references previous litigation on the requirement for environmental clearance and notes that the government has consistently supported the mining industry, even in violation of environmental regulations.

The court emphasized the need for sustainable development and the protection of the environment. The court dismissed the company's request for police protection and orders them to comply with the Paddy Land Act. The court also finds that an environmental impact assessment at this stage would be futile and that the company did not have a prior EC for areas above 5 hectares. The court orders the company to comply with the SEAC and SEIAA's recommendations and to restore the damaged land.

In one of the cases, a mining company has been carrying out illegal mining activities without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The court has ordered an inspection of the site and recovery of the value of the illegally extracted minerals. The company has also been fined Rs. 10 lakhs for abusing the legal process and not impleading the parties who were opposing the mining activities. The fine must be paid to the Chief Minister's Relief Fund within two months, or the District Collector will proceed with recovery under the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act. The court has also directed that the costs imposed will be in addition to the recovery made of the value of the illegal extraction.

In another case, the court imposed additional recovery on top of the value of illegal extraction at a rate of 100%, as directed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Private parties were treated unfairly and not impleaded in a writ petition seeking EC for mining. The company is directed to pay a cost of Rs.10,000/- each to the petitioners and the appellant. If the cost is not paid, the petitioners and the appellant can approach the District Collector for revenue recovery proceedings. The state is directed to initiate prosecution against the officials of the company and the erring officers of the state under the Environment Protection Act.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of obtaining prior environmental clearance for mining activities and the need to protect the environment. The court also emphasizes the need for sustainable development and criticizes the government for failing to take action to stop illegal mining activities. The court has
