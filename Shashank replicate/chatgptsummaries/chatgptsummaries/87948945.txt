The High Court recently issued a court order in response to a petition filed by Navghan Keshubhai Parmar, an accused in a case registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. Parmar had requested a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 (5A) of the Cr.P.C. The learned Sessions Court had ordered the Investigating Agency to supply a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded by the IO, but only after the chief examination of the prosecutrix. Parmar challenged this order, and the High Court quashed and set aside the order, directing the Investigating Agency to supply a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 (5A) of the Cr.P.C. to Parmar immediately.

The case pertains to an alleged crime committed against a member of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes. The accused, Parmar, had requested a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 (5A) of the Cr.P.C. This section of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for the recording of a statement by a victim or witness before a magistrate. The statement is recorded in the presence of the accused and their counsel, and it can be used as evidence in court.

The Sessions Court had ordered the Investigating Agency to supply a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded by the IO, but only after the chief examination of the prosecutrix. The chief examination is the first stage of the trial, during which the prosecution presents its case and the witnesses are examined. Parmar challenged this order, arguing that he had a right to access the statement of the prosecutrix before the chief examination.

The High Court agreed with Parmar and quashed the Sessions Court's order. The court directed the Investigating Agency to supply a copy of the statement of the prosecutrix recorded under Section 164 (5A) of the Cr.P.C. to Parmar immediately. The court noted that Parmar had a right to access the statement of the prosecutrix under Article 21 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.

The court also noted that the right to access the statement of the prosecutrix was subject to certain limitations. The court stated that the statement could only be used for the purpose of cross-examination and could not be used for any other purpose. The court also directed Parmar to maintain the confidentiality of the statement and not to disclose it to anyone else.

The court's decision has important implications for the rights of accused persons in criminal trials. The right to access evidence is a fundamental right of an accused person, and the court's decision reaffirms this right. The decision also highlights the importance of balancing the rights of the accused with the rights of the victim. While the accused has a right to access evidence, this right must be balanced against the victim's right to privacy and confidentiality.

In conclusion, the High Court's court order in response to Parmar's petition is an important decision that reaffirms the rights of accused persons in criminal trials. The court's decision highlights the importance of balancing the rights of the accused with the rights of the victim and underscores the need to protect the confidentiality and privacy of victims. The decision is a significant step towards ensuring that the criminal justice system is fair and just for all parties involved.
