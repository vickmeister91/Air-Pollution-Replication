The court recently heard several writ petitions filed by doctors who were punished by the Medical Council of India for professional misconduct. One of the petitioners, Dr. Anil Bharani, was punished for three months and was not allowed to practice as a doctor, even though he was working as an Assistant Professor at a medical college. The court found that the Medical Council of India did not grant the petitioner an opportunity for a personal hearing, which is required by law. The court also noted that the punishment was for a stale incident from 2012, and that keeping doctors idle for three months would not serve any purpose, given the shortage of doctors. The court allowed the petition and held that the principles of natural justice and fair play were violated.

The court order emphasizes the importance of adhering to principles of natural justice when a quasi-judicial body is determining disputes or any administrative action involving civil consequences. The audi alteram partem rule, which states that no one should be condemned unheard, is a fundamental principle of natural justice. The court also notes that rules of natural justice may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute, and that even administrative orders involving civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice. The order provides various definitions of natural justice given by different judges.

The court order discusses the principles of natural justice, which include the duty to act fairly and the right to a fair hearing. Two rules have been developed through judicial interpretation: "nemo judex in causa sua" (no man shall be a judge in his own cause) and "audi alteram partem" (hear the other side). The court also discusses the "useless formality theory" and the varying opinions on whether relief can be refused even if natural justice is not followed. The court notes that there is a considerable unanimity that the courts can refuse certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, or injunction even if natural justice is not followed.

The court order states that natural justice was not followed and that there are cases where notice provisions can be waived for individual benefit but not for public interest. The court does not express an opinion on the "useless formality theory" and quashes the impugned order dated 26.07.2017. The writ petition is allowed and all connected writ petitions are also allowed.

In summary, the court order highlights the importance of adhering to principles of natural justice when a quasi-judicial body is determining disputes or any administrative action involving civil consequences. The audi alteram partem rule, which states that no one should be condemned unheard, is a fundamental principle of natural justice. The court also notes that rules of natural justice may be implied from the nature of the duty to be performed under a statute, and that even administrative orders involving civil consequences must be consistent with the rules of natural justice.

In the case of Dr. Anil Bharani, the court found that the Medical Council of India did not grant the petitioner an opportunity for a personal hearing, which is required by law. The court also noted that the punishment was for a stale incident from 2012, and that keeping doctors idle for three months would not serve any purpose, given the shortage of doctors. The court allowed the petition and held that the principles of natural justice and fair play were violated.

Overall, the court order serves as a reminder that natural justice must be followed in all administrative actions involving civil consequences, and that failure to do so can result in the quashing of the impugned order. It also highlights the importance of providing individuals with a fair hearing and the right to be heard before any decision is made.
