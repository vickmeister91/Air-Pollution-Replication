The court order in question pertains to a writ appeal filed by the Chief Secretary to the Government of Karnataka against an order passed in a writ petition. The petitioner had been granted a mining lease for quarrying granite in a forest reserve, but the lease had expired and not been renewed. The petitioner had filed multiple writ petitions seeking permits to transport the granite blocks extracted during the lease period. The Hon'ble Single Judge had directed the government to issue the permits, but the State appealed the decision, arguing that non-forest activities cannot be undertaken in a reserve forest.

The court considered the relevant rules and acts and upheld the State's appeal, stating that the petitioner had no right to extract or transport the granite blocks after the lease had expired. The court relied on the case of Divisional Forest Officer and others Vs. S. Nageswaramma, which held that mining operations within forest areas are prohibited unless the State Government grants a mining lease with the prior concurrence of the Central Government. As the lease in question was not extended beyond July 20, 1982, any granite blocks extracted but not removed from the mine became the property of the State.

The court order also states that any mines or minerals extracted from a quarry and not removed by the lessee before the termination of the lease will become the property of the government. Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act prohibits any non-forest activity, including the use of forest land for non-forest purposes or assigning forest land to private individuals or organizations without prior approval from the Central Government.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the relevant laws and regulations. The court found that the petitioner had no right to extract or transport the granite blocks after the lease had expired, and that any blocks that were not removed from the mine before the termination of the lease became the property of the State. The court also upheld the State's argument that non-forest activities cannot be undertaken in a reserve forest, and that any use of forest land for non-forest purposes requires prior approval from the Central Government.

The court's decision is significant because it reinforces the importance of following the laws and regulations governing the use of forest land. The court's decision also highlights the need for lessees to carefully manage their mining operations and ensure that they comply with all relevant laws and regulations. Failure to do so can result in the loss of valuable resources and legal disputes that can be costly and time-consuming.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following the laws and regulations governing the use of forest land. The court's decision also highlights the need for lessees to carefully manage their mining operations and ensure that they comply with all relevant laws and regulations. By doing so, lessees can avoid legal disputes and ensure that they are able to extract and transport valuable resources in a responsible and sustainable manner.
