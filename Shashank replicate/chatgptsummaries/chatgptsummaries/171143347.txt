The case at hand involves allegations of criminal offences against Sri Lokesh B and Sri Gopi Naidu. The petitioner, Sri H.V. Somashekar, had filed an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking the summoning of documents filed in a civil suit pending in the city civil court, Bangalore. The petitioner had alleged that the documents were necessary for the proper adjudication of the criminal case.

However, the court rejected the application, stating that Section 91 of Cr.P.C. could not have been invoked by the petitioner as a matter of course. The court held that the petitioner had failed to establish that the documents sought were necessary for the proper adjudication of the criminal case. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the parties to the civil suit.

The court's decision was based on a careful consideration of the provisions of Section 91 of Cr.P.C. Section 91 provides that a court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, summon and examine any person as a witness or call for and examine any document or thing. However, the court may only do so if it is satisfied that the document or thing is necessary for the proper adjudication of the case.

The court noted that the power to summon documents under Section 91 is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The court also observed that the mere fact that a document is relevant to the case is not sufficient to justify its summoning. The court must be satisfied that the document is necessary for the proper adjudication of the case.

In the present case, the court found that the petitioner had failed to establish that the documents sought were necessary for the proper adjudication of the criminal case. The court also noted that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the parties to the civil suit. The court therefore rejected the application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C.

The court's decision is significant as it underscores the importance of exercising discretion judiciously when summoning documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. The court's decision also highlights the need for parties to make a genuine effort to obtain documents through other means before seeking their summoning under Section 91.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Sri H.V. Somashekar against Sri Lokesh B and Sri Gopi Naidu. The court rejected the petitioner's application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking the summoning of documents filed in a civil suit pending in the city civil court, Bangalore. The court held that the petitioner had failed to establish that the documents sought were necessary for the proper adjudication of the criminal case. The court's decision underscores the importance of exercising discretion judiciously when summoning documents under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. and highlights the need for parties to make a genuine effort to obtain documents through other means before seeking their summoning under Section 91.
