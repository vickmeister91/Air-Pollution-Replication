The Wildlife Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect the country's wildlife and their habitats. It is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. Violations of this act are taken very seriously, and those found guilty can face severe penalties, including imprisonment.

In this case, Hare Singh was apprehensive of being arrested for violating the Wildlife Protection Act. However, the court has granted him anticipatory bail, which means that he will not be arrested if he abides by the conditions set forth by the court. The conditions include furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with a surety in the same amount to the satisfaction of the arresting authority. This means that Hare Singh must provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he will appear in court when required. Additionally, he must also abide by the conditions listed in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C.

The conditions listed in sub-Section (2) of Section 438 of Cr.P.C. are as follows:

1. Hare Singh must make himself available for interrogation by the police officer as and when required.

2. He must not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat, or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer.

3. He must not leave India without the permission of the court.

4. He must surrender his passport, if any, to the court.

5. He must not tamper with the evidence or attempt to influence or intimidate any witness.

These conditions are standard for anticipatory bail and are designed to ensure that the accused does not abscond or tamper with the evidence. By granting anticipatory bail, the court has given Hare Singh the opportunity to defend himself against the charges without being arrested. However, he must abide by the conditions set forth by the court, failing which the bail may be cancelled.
