The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to disputes over land ownership and resumption by the government. In the first case, a partnership firm called Munnar Woods filed a writ petition challenging an order by the District Collector, Idukki, Kerala, to resume 2.84 acres of property owned by the petitioner for violating the Rules for Lease of Government Lands for Cardamom Cultivation, 1961. The petitioner claimed that they had purchased the land and converted it into a resort in an eco-friendly manner without violating any rules. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

In the second case, the court order states that the land assigned to Pylee Varghese is liable to be resumed by the government if transferred, and since his widow transferred the land, the assignment is terminated. The government's inconsistent legal arguments are criticized, and the petitioner's claim to title is examined. The court finds that the petitioner's documents establish their title to the property, and that there is no bar to considering this in the writ petition. The court also notes inconsistencies in the government's case against the petitioner.

The third court order discusses a writ petition challenging an order of the District Collector to resume land for violation of rules. The petitioner claims title to the land based on admitted documents and argues that the question of title can be considered in a writ petition. The court agrees and finds that the petitioner has established title to the land. The court also examines the grounds for resumption of the land under the 1935 Rules and finds that the allegations are not applicable to the land in question. The court quashes the order to resume the land.

In the fourth case, the court order discusses the rules and conditions for land grants in relation to a specific case. The court concludes that the grant in question is not a concessional grant and therefore cannot be cancelled for violating a condition related to concessional grants. The court also notes that the rules do not provide for resumption of land for non-cultivation of cardamom or alienation of the land, except in certain circumstances related to extensive tree felling or wanton destruction of tree growth. The court further examines a government order from 1942 that regulates the registry of cardamom lands and imposes conditions on the assignment of such lands, including the termination of registry if the land is alienated without government approval.

In the fifth case, the court order discusses a dispute over the resumption of land by the government due to a violation of conditions stipulated in a grant agreement. The petitioner argues that the conditions in question do not apply to their grant, and the court agrees. The order also discusses the doctrine of desuetude, which applies to Indian statutes and can be used to hold that a statute has become a dead letter due to disuse. The court applies this doctrine to the case and finds that the government cannot invoke the 1935 Rules to deprive the petitioner of their property. The order also criticizes the government's decision to demolish valuable buildings on the property during the resumption process.

Finally, in the sixth case, the court order states that the petitioner had possession of a property for over 68 years, but the 4th respondent took action to destroy the property without giving the petitioner a chance to seek legal remedies. The court finds this action to be highhanded and illegal, and orders the restoration of the land to the petitioner. The court also orders that if the petitioner has any claim for damages, they can approach the appropriate forum to prove their claim. The court further orders that the person who passed the order to destroy the property is personally responsible for paying the petitioner's legal costs, which should not be debited to the exchequer.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of establishing clear ownership and title to land, as well as the need for government officials to follow proper legal procedures when resuming land. The court's decisions in these cases demonstrate a commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting the rights of property owners.
