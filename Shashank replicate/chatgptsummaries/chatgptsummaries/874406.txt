In the first court order, the case revolves around a motor vehicle accident that occurred in Jabalpur, India. The accident involved a bus owned by the Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and a motor-cycle driven by Inderjeet Singh, who unfortunately died in the accident. The widow and son of the deceased applied for compensation, but the Claims Tribunal dismissed the claim, stating that the deceased was negligent. The appellants appealed the decision, and the court found that both the driver of the bus and the deceased were negligent, and apportioned the blame in a 2:1 ratio.

The court also discussed the applicability of the defence of contributory negligence in India and the selective application of English law in Indian courts. Contributory negligence is a common law doctrine that holds that if a plaintiff is partially responsible for their own injury, then they cannot recover damages from the defendant. The court noted that this doctrine is harsh and can lead to unjust outcomes, particularly in cases where the plaintiff's negligence is minor compared to the defendant's negligence. The court suggested that the principle of apportionment enacted in the English Act of 1945 is more just and should be applied instead of the old rule of contributory negligence.

The court also discussed the selective application of English law in Indian courts. The court noted that Indian courts have historically applied English law in cases where there is no Indian law on the subject. However, the court cautioned that English law should only be applied if it is consistent with Indian law and public policy.

In the second court order, the court discusses the doctrine of contributory negligence and its harshness in common law. The court notes that the principle of apportionment enacted in the English Act of 1945 is more just and should be applied instead of the old rule of contributory negligence. The court then calculates the damages in a specific case involving a deceased mechanic and his dependents, ultimately awarding a reduced amount of Rs. 10,000 due to the deceased's partial contribution to the accident. The appeal is partly allowed and the respondents are ordered to pay the appellants the awarded amount.

Overall, both court orders highlight the importance of considering the principle of apportionment in cases involving negligence. The court notes that the old rule of contributory negligence can lead to unjust outcomes and that the principle of apportionment is a more just way of determining liability. Additionally, the court cautions against the selective application of English law in Indian courts and notes that English law should only be applied if it is consistent with Indian law and public policy.
