The recent court order pertains to a question of whether the sugar/alcohol industry is covered by entry No. 15 of Schedule I to Central Act No. 36 of 1977, i.e., Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court concludes that the sugar industry is covered by this entry, despite arguments to the contrary. The court also dismisses the petitions and makes no order as to costs.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons carrying on certain industries and by local authorities, with a view to augmenting the resources of the Central Board and the State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Act provides for the levy of a cess on the water consumed by industries listed in Schedule I of the Act. Entry No. 15 of Schedule I pertains to the sugar industry.

The question before the court was whether the sugar/alcohol industry is covered by entry No. 15 of Schedule I to the Act. The petitioners argued that the sugar industry is not covered by this entry, as the industry does not consume water directly, but only uses it as a raw material in the production process. The petitioners also argued that the levy of cess on the sugar industry would be unconstitutional, as it would amount to a tax on the production of sugar, which is a subject matter of the State List under the Constitution of India.

The court, however, rejected these arguments and held that the sugar industry is covered by entry No. 15 of Schedule I to the Act. The court observed that the sugar industry consumes water indirectly, as water is an essential component of the production process. The court also held that the levy of cess on the sugar industry is not unconstitutional, as it is a fee for the use of water, and not a tax on the production of sugar.

The court's decision is significant, as it clarifies the scope of entry No. 15 of Schedule I to the Act and brings clarity to the issue of whether the sugar industry is covered by the Act. The decision also upholds the principle of polluter pays, as it requires the sugar industry to pay a cess for the use of water, which is a scarce resource.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertains to the question of whether the sugar/alcohol industry is covered by entry No. 15 of Schedule I to the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court held that the sugar industry is covered by this entry, despite arguments to the contrary. The court's decision clarifies the scope of the Act and upholds the principle of polluter pays. The dismissal of the petitions and the decision not to order costs is also noteworthy, as it reflects the court's view that the issue was a matter of public interest.
