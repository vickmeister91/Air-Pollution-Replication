The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently dismissed two petitions filed by M/S S.M. Industries and M/S Nirman Industries under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of criminal complaint No.2 of 2015 registered under Sections 37 and 38 of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court found that the complaint and summoning order were not an abuse of process of law and that the subsequent permission granted by the competent authority was of no help as the offence in the complaint pertained to the period for which there was no permission from the Pollution Control Board.

The case pertains to the violation of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 by M/S S.M. Industries and M/S Nirman Industries. The complaint was filed against the two companies for causing air pollution by burning rubber tyres and other waste materials in their factories. The complaint was filed by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and the summoning order was issued by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana.

The two companies had filed petitions under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of the complaint and summoning order. They had argued that the complaint was filed after a delay of more than two years and that the summoning order was issued without proper application of mind. They had also argued that the subsequent permission granted by the competent authority should be taken into consideration.

However, the court found that the complaint and summoning order were not an abuse of process of law. The court observed that the delay in filing the complaint was not fatal to the case as the offence was a continuing one and the cause of action continued till the date of filing of the complaint. The court also observed that the summoning order was issued after proper application of mind and that the magistrate had considered the material on record before issuing the order.

The court also found that the subsequent permission granted by the competent authority was of no help as the offence in the complaint pertained to the period for which there was no permission from the Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the permission granted by the competent authority was for a different period and for a different purpose and could not be used to condone the offence committed by the two companies.

The court also observed that the two companies had not challenged the validity of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the rules made thereunder. The court observed that the Act and the rules made thereunder were enacted to protect the environment and the health of the people and that the two companies could not be allowed to violate the same with impunity.

In conclusion, the Punjab-Haryana High Court dismissed the petitions filed by M/S S.M. Industries and M/S Nirman Industries under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing of criminal complaint No.2 of 2015 registered under Sections 37 and 38 of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court found that the complaint and summoning order were not an abuse of process of law and that the subsequent permission granted by the competent authority was of no help as the offence in the complaint pertained to the period for which there was no permission from the Pollution Control Board. The court upheld the validity of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the rules made thereunder and observed that the Act and the rules made thereunder were enacted to protect the environment and the health of the people.
