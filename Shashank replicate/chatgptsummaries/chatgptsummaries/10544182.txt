The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India and others. The case has been ongoing for some time, and the court heard several interim applications related to the case during this particular hearing. These applications included requests for intervention, stay, and clarification of previous orders.

During the hearing, the court noted a preliminary objection raised by the Amicus that the applications should be heard by a bench of three judges. The court referred to a note approved by the Chief Justice in 2010 regarding the listing of such applications. Ultimately, the court accepted the submission that matters relating to T.N. Godavarman and M.C. Mehta can be heard by a bench of two judges, unless a recall or modification of an order passed by a three-judge bench is required.

The court's decision to accept this submission has important implications for the ongoing case. It means that future applications related to the case will likely be heard by a bench of two judges, rather than three. This could potentially speed up the legal process and allow for quicker resolution of the case.

However, it's worth noting that the court's decision does not necessarily mean that the case will be resolved quickly. There are still many factors at play, and it's possible that further delays could occur. Nonetheless, the court's decision is a positive development for those involved in the case, as it suggests that the legal process may be moving forward.

The matter was listed for further hearing on November 14, 2017. This means that there will be another hearing in the near future, during which the court will likely hear additional arguments and evidence related to the case. It's unclear at this time what the outcome of this hearing will be, but it's possible that it could bring the case one step closer to resolution.

Overall, the court order in question is an important development in the ongoing case filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India and others. The court's decision to accept the submission that matters relating to T.N. Godavarman and M.C. Mehta can be heard by a bench of two judges has important implications for the legal process moving forward. While it's unclear what the outcome of future hearings will be, this decision suggests that the case may be moving closer to resolution.
