The court found that no case was made out for granting bail in anticipation of their arrest.

The case in question pertains to the seizure of material from the house of Durga Singh and another person, who were accused of committing an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The material seized included animal skins, bones, and other parts, which were suspected to have been obtained illegally. The accused were subsequently arrested and charged with various offences under the Act.

The accused had filed a bail application in anticipation of their arrest, which was dismissed by the court. The court found that there was no case made out for granting bail, as the accused had not been able to establish that they were entitled to bail. The court also noted that the accused had not been able to show that they were not likely to commit any further offences if released on bail.

The court further observed that the accused had not been able to show that they were not likely to tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses if released on bail. The court noted that the material seized from their house was of a serious nature and that there was a likelihood of the accused tampering with the evidence if released on bail.

The court also took into account the fact that the accused had a criminal history and that they had been involved in similar offences in the past. The court noted that the accused had not been able to show that they had reformed or that they were not likely to commit any further offences if released on bail.

In light of these observations, the court dismissed the bail application of Durga Singh and another person. The court held that there was no case made out for granting bail in anticipation of their arrest, and that the accused would have to remain in custody until their trial was completed.

In conclusion, the court order dismissing the bail application of Durga Singh and another person in a case related to the seizure of material from their house and an offence committed under the Wild Life Protection Act highlights the importance of establishing a strong case for bail. The court found that the accused had not been able to establish that they were entitled to bail, and that there was a likelihood of them tampering with the evidence or influencing the witnesses if released on bail. The court's decision underscores the need for accused persons to provide compelling reasons for why they should be granted bail, and to demonstrate that they are not likely to commit any further offences if released on bail.
