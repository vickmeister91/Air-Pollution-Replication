The Delhi High Court recently heard a summary suit under Order XXXVII, Code of Civil Procedure, where the plaintiff sought a decree for the sum of Rs. 42,46,575/- with interest at 18% per annum. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants obtained money from it under false pretences, as they were aware of the pending litigation in relation to land. The defendant argued that the suit was not maintainable as the contract contained an arbitration clause and that the court lacked territorial jurisdiction to try the suit.

The court had to determine whether the suit was maintainable, whether it had jurisdiction, and whether the defendant's application revealed triable issues. The court noted that certain essential facts were not disputed, including the existence of an agreement between the parties and the issuance of two cheques by the defendant. The court also discussed the circumstances under which a claim can be referred to arbitration.

The court allowed the reporters of local papers to see the judgment and ordered that the judgment should be reported in the digest. The court denied the defendant's application for leave to defend as it did not make out any reasonable or bona fide defense. The plaintiff was awarded Rs. 31,00,000/- with 15% interest from 1-1-2007, and pendente lite, as well as future interest, at the same rate. The defendant's claim for Rs. 1.55 crores was deemed misconceived and untenable. The court also rejected two other applications filed by the defendant. The plaintiff was awarded costs and counsel's fee of Rs. 55,000/-.

The court order discusses a dispute between parties over a transaction involving leased land. The defendant had agreed to repay Rs. 31 lakhs to the plaintiff to close the transaction, but the plaintiff claims that the defendant suppressed the fact that there were disputes between the defendant and a third party. The defendant argues that there is a valid arbitration agreement that should be used to resolve the dispute.

The court ruled that the original agreement was discharged by mutual agreement and that the arbitration clause did not bind the parties. The court also held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the suit and that the defendant did not disclose a good or sufficient defense to be granted leave to defend the proceedings.

The court order states that the defendant and plaintiff had a dispute over a leased land, which led to the plaintiff requesting a refund of the amounts paid. The parties reached an understanding, and the defendant issued two cheques in consideration of this agreement. However, the defendant later claimed that the cheques were not payable and that there was an arbitration clause in the original agreement.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court heard a summary suit under Order XXXVII, Code of Civil Procedure, where the plaintiff sought a decree for the sum of Rs. 42,46,575/- with interest at 18% per annum.
