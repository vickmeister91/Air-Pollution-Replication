The court case discussed in these summaries involves a dispute between a housing project developer and environmental authorities in Kerala, India. The developer claims to have obtained all necessary permissions for the project, while the coastal management authority and environment authority disagree. The project was approved by the Central Expert Appraisal Committee and was examined by the CRZ Committee of the Ministry. However, the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority issued a letter seeking an explanation for construction without necessary permissions. The case highlights the ongoing conflict between environmental protection and development.

The court order discusses a project proposal and the various violations that occurred during its construction, including land reclamation and lack of prior approval. The KCZMA/appellant, an authority responsible for preserving the environment in coastal areas, is criticized for not taking action earlier. The court ultimately upholds the findings of the learned single Judge but directs regularisation subject to a fine/compensation amount of Rs.1 crore to be deposited for building up the environment and maintaining ecological balance in the area. The KCZMA/appellant appeals the decision and argues that the building should be demolished or the fine substantially increased. Various issues, including FSI and FAR status, are raised. Some officials are facing vigilance cases.

The court order discusses the various stands taken by different parties in a case involving the construction of a building in a no-development zone in Cochin. The court notes that there are pending vigilance cases against some officials and the former chairman of KCZMA, and actions have been taken against other violators as well. The Cochin Municipal Corporation has largely confined itself to the issue of FAR sanction, while the State of Kerala has supported the stand of KCZMA. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has taken contradictory stands in its affidavits. DLF, the company responsible for the construction, has obtained all the requisite permissions but is facing allegations of violating CRZ notifications and environmental clearance. The court expresses concern over the authorities' failure to perform their tasks with promptitude.

The court order expresses concern over the lack of prompt action by authorities in enforcing regulations related to environment and ecological balance. The court emphasizes the importance of compliance with regulations and cites previous cases where illegal structures were ordered to be demolished. The court also criticizes the lack of clarity and understanding between various authorities, which has put large investments at risk. The court examines the case of DLF and the allegations of large-scale violations, but finds that the alleged violations have not emerged with clarity. The court also criticizes the lackadaisical attitude of specialized authorities in carrying out their tasks promptly. The court concludes that if the allegations of violations were correct, there would be no alternative but to bring down the structure. However, the court finds that the fault lies with the authorities for not performing their tasks with promptitude.

The court order states that the construction by DLF falls in CRZ II areas and the narrow canal was not an impediment to the construction. The proposal was cleared by SEIAA, being the final authority, and that has never been withdrawn or cancelled or challenged. The court is not in agreement with the findings of the Courts below on the violations alleged against DLF except to the extent that there is a question mark on the issue of not having obtained prior clearance and proceeding on the basis of a deemed clearance. The court has clarified that whatever be the manner in which Clause 8(3) of Notification of 2006 is worded, it should imply henceforth a prior clearance and necessary clarifications should be issued by the concerned authorities in a time-bound manner to obviate such situations to arise in the future. The court has sustained the fine of Rs.1 crore with the direction for strict adherence to the norms in the future and avoidance of such contradictions by the authorities.
