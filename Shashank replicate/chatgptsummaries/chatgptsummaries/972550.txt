The petitioner, Viswambharan, filed an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to issue summons to the Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) to produce a report filed before the Dy.S.P., Special Branch (Intelligence) on 25.7.2008.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that the Chief Judicial Magistrate is conducting only an inquiry under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the question of whether the incident took place or not is to be decided by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate based on the statements given and materials produced before him and not based on any opinion formed by the Additional Director General of Police in his inquiry.

To understand the court order in more detail, it is important to understand the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure that are being referred to. Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the inquiry into cases where the police have not filed a charge sheet. In such cases, the Magistrate can conduct an inquiry to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the case. 

Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the power of the court to issue summons to produce documents or other things. This section allows the court to issue a summons to any person to produce any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the inherent powers of the High Court. This section allows the High Court to make any order necessary to give effect to any order under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

In this case, Viswambharan had filed an application under section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to issue summons to the Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) to produce a report filed before the Dy.S.P., Special Branch (Intelligence) on 25.7.2008. The report in question was related to the alleged abuse of a witness by Joseph Thomas.

The Chief Judicial Magistrate dismissed the petition, stating that the report was not necessary for the inquiry being conducted under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Viswambharan then filed a petition under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the order.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that the Chief Judicial Magistrate was conducting only an inquiry under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the question of whether the incident took place or not is to be decided by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate based on the statements given and materials produced before him and not based on any opinion formed by the Additional Director General of Police in his inquiry.

In other words, the court held that the report filed by the Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) was not relevant to the inquiry being conducted under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court also emphasized that the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate would make a decision based on the evidence presented before him, and not based on any opinion formed by the Additional Director General of Police in his inquiry.

Overall, the court order in this case emphasizes the importance of following the procedures laid out in the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also highlights the limited role of the Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) in the inquiry being conducted under section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Ultimately, the decision on whether the incident took place or not will be made by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate based on the evidence presented before him.
