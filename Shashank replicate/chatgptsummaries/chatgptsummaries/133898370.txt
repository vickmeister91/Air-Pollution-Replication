The Jharkhand High Court recently set aside an order taking cognizance of an offense under Section 16 of the Pollution (Control) Act, 1986, as there is no such legislation in existence. The court found that the cognizance order was passed without any application of mind and in a mechanical manner. The matter has been remanded to the court below for passing a fresh order in accordance with the law after going through the specific provision of law.

The case in question pertains to an alleged violation of the Pollution (Control) Act, 1986, by a company. The company was accused of discharging untreated effluent into a nearby river, which resulted in the pollution of the river and the surrounding areas. The local authorities had filed a complaint against the company, and the court had taken cognizance of the offense under Section 16 of the Act.

However, during the course of the proceedings, it was pointed out that Section 16 of the Pollution (Control) Act, 1986, did not exist. The court, upon examining the matter, found that the cognizance order had been passed without any application of mind and in a mechanical manner. The court observed that the order did not refer to any specific provision of law and was passed merely on the basis of the complaint filed by the local authorities.

The court further noted that the magistrate had not applied his mind to the provisions of the law and had not considered whether the allegations made in the complaint constituted an offense under any specific provision of law. The court held that the magistrate had failed to discharge his duty of applying his mind to the matter and had passed the order in a mechanical manner.

The court, therefore, set aside the cognizance order and remanded the matter to the court below for passing a fresh order in accordance with the law after going through the specific provision of law. The court directed the magistrate to consider the allegations made in the complaint and to determine whether they constituted an offense under any specific provision of law.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of applying one's mind to the matter at hand and considering the specific provisions of law before passing an order. The court's decision also emphasizes the need for magistrates to discharge their duties diligently and not to pass orders in a mechanical manner.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to set aside the cognizance order under Section 16 of the Pollution (Control) Act, 1986, is a welcome move. The court's decision serves as a reminder to all judicial officers to apply their minds to the matter at hand and to consider the specific provisions of law before passing an order. The decision also underscores the importance of ensuring that justice is delivered in a fair and impartial manner.
