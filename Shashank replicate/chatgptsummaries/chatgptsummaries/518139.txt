The first court order involves a case where landlords leased land for residential purposes only, but portions of the buildings were let out for commercial purposes. The Delhi Development Authority gave notice to the landlords that the leases were liable to be determined. The landlords issued notice to the tenants asking them to stop the commercial use of the buildings and later instituted proceedings against the tenants under the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958. The question for consideration was whether the landlords were estopped or otherwise prohibited from getting possession of the property from the tenants because they themselves had let it out for commercial purposes.

The court held that the lease was not void, and the landlord was not estopped from claiming possession because he himself was a party to the breach of the conditions under which the land was leased to him. The court reasoned that the landlord had leased the land for residential purposes only, and the tenants had breached the lease agreement by using the property for commercial purposes. Therefore, the landlord was entitled to seek possession of the property.

The second court order discusses a case where a landlord wants to evict a tenant for using part of the building for commercial purposes, which is against the lease agreement. The court determines that the landlord can seek eviction under clause (c) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 14, and that clause (k) only applies in cases where the lease is for a commercial purpose agreed upon by both the landlord and tenant, but that is contrary to the terms of the lease of the land in favor of the landlord.

The court also determines that Section 14 of the Delhi Development Act has no relevance in this case. The matter is sent back to the Controller to decide whether to exercise the option of eviction or compensation under sub-section (11) of Section 14.

In summary, both court orders deal with cases where landlords are seeking possession of property from tenants who have breached the lease agreement by using the property for commercial purposes. In the first case, the court held that the landlord was entitled to seek possession of the property, despite having let it out for commercial purposes himself. In the second case, the court determined that the landlord could seek eviction under clause (c) of the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 14, and that Section 14 of the Delhi Development Act had no relevance in the case. The matter was sent back to the Controller to decide whether to exercise the option of eviction or compensation under sub-section (11) of Section 14.
