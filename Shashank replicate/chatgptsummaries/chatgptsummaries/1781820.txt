The lease was for quarrying minor minerals from an area of 1.60 acres in Village Hadia in the district of Nawadah. The lease was demised from 14th of April, 1991 for a period of ten years. The petitioner deposited the required fee by treasury challan and filed an application for renewal of the lease before the expiry of ten years.

The court dismissed the application and ordered the petitioner to pay Rs. 500/- as cost to the respondents.

The case revolves around the renewal of a quarry lease for mining minor minerals in the district of Nawadah. The lease was initially granted for a period of ten years, and the petitioner filed an application for renewal before the expiry of the lease. However, the Collector rejected the application on the grounds of an amendment brought by the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2001. The petitioner challenged this decision in court, but the court ultimately dismissed the application and ordered the petitioner to pay Rs. 500/- as cost to the respondents.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2001, had introduced a new provision that stated that a lease could only be renewed once for a period of five years. The court held that this provision was valid and that the Collector had correctly rejected the petitioner's application for renewal.

The court's decision highlights the importance of complying with the relevant laws and regulations when applying for the renewal of a lease. In this case, the petitioner had filed the application for renewal before the expiry of the lease and had deposited the required fee. However, the Collector was within his rights to reject the application on the grounds of the new provision introduced by the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2001.

The court's decision also serves as a reminder that it is important to stay up-to-date with any changes in the laws and regulations that govern a particular industry or activity. In this case, the petitioner may have been unaware of the new provision introduced by the Bihar Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rules, 2001, which ultimately led to the rejection of their application for renewal.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of complying with the relevant laws and regulations when applying for the renewal of a lease. It also serves as a reminder of the need to stay up-to-date with any changes in the laws and regulations that govern a particular industry or activity.
