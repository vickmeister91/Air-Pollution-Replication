The court order pertains to a petition filed by Munna Lal Verma seeking the quashing of charges framed against him by the Special Judge (Prevention of Corruption Act), Morena, for offences punishable under sections 420 and 406 of the IPC and Section 13(1)(c) read with Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1982. The court has closed the right to submit a copy of the order and has decided to hear the matter under Section 482 of the CrPC finally.

The court has examined the documents and held that the case cannot be quashed merely because a civil wrong has also been committed. The court has laid down relevant parameters for interference under Section 482 CrPC. The court order states that at the stage where the case is currently, the court should not examine the facts, evidence, and material on record to determine whether there is sufficient material that may end in a conviction. The court is only concerned with the allegations taken as a whole whether they will constitute an offense.

The court cannot take into consideration external materials given by an accused for arriving at a conclusion that no offense was disclosed or there was a possibility of acquittal. The court should exercise the power of quashing criminal proceedings very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of the rare cases. The court should apply the test as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made from the record of the case and the documents submitted therewith prima facie establish the offense or not.

In the present case, no ground is made out for quashing the FIR or to quash the charges. The petition under Section 482 of CrPC is dismissed.
