The Bihar High Court recently passed a judgment in multiple writ petitions filed by saw mill owners who were aggrieved by the rejection of their license renewal applications, cancellation of licenses, or non-consideration of their applications for renewal/grant of licenses. The petitioners claimed that they had established saw mills outside forest areas, which were their source of livelihood, but the licensing authorities had arbitrarily denied them licenses. 

The court examined whether the general directions issued by the Supreme Court in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India case, relating to the Forest (Conservation) Act, would come in the way of their right to do business of running saw mills outside forest or non-forest areas. The court found that the directions were given for the purpose of taking a final decision on the number of saw mills and timber-based industries that should be allowed to continue their operation in the state, and as such, the authorities could not proceed with the grant of renewal or fresh licenses during the interregnum period. 

The court also held that Section 5 of the Bihar Saw Mills (Regulation) Act, which provides for deemed approval of licenses in case the application filed for grant of license is not disposed of within the stipulated time, does not apply to the present case. The court clarified that the provision regarding deemed approval under Section 5 of the State Act does not apply to the case at hand. 

In another case involving the renewal of a saw mill license, the court noted that the suspension of the license was related to the renewal/grant of the license and that the necessary procedure was not followed. The court dismissed the writ petitions and clarified that the order does not affect saw mills that were in existence and had a license on the date of the report by the Expert Committee. 

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the right of saw mill owners to do business outside forest areas and ensures that the licensing authorities cannot arbitrarily deny them licenses. The court's interpretation of the Supreme Court's directions in the T.N. Godavarman Thirumulkpad v. Union of India case also provides clarity on the issue of granting renewal or fresh licenses during the interregnum period. 

However, the court's decision also highlights the need for proper procedure to be followed in the renewal/grant of licenses and the importance of complying with the provisions of the Bihar Saw Mills (Regulation) Act. The court's clarification on the provision regarding deemed approval under Section 5 of the State Act also provides guidance to licensing authorities on the issue of disposal of license applications within the stipulated time. 

Overall, the court's decision strikes a balance between the rights of saw mill owners to do business and the need to regulate the industry in a manner that is sustainable and in compliance with the law. It is a welcome development for saw mill owners in Bihar and provides clarity on the issue of license renewal and grant.
