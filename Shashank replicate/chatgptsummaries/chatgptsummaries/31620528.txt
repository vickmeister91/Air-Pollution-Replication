The court order pertains to the case of Kodu Prasad Panika, who has been in custody since April 28, 2017, for hunting a wild animal. The charge-sheet has been filed, and the trial is expected to take a long time. The applicant has applied for bail, which has been granted on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and one surety of the same amount.

The court has imposed several conditions on the applicant, which he must comply with to avoid the cancellation of his bail. The first condition is that he must cooperate in the investigation/trial. This means that he must provide all the necessary information and evidence to the investigating officer and attend all the court hearings.

The second condition is that he must not commit a similar offense. This condition is imposed to ensure that the applicant does not engage in any illegal activities while he is out on bail. If he is found to have committed a similar offense, his bail may be canceled, and he may be sent back to custody.

The third condition is that he must not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial. This condition is imposed to ensure that the trial proceeds smoothly and without any unnecessary delays. If the applicant seeks unnecessary adjournments, it may delay the trial, and the court may cancel his bail.

The fourth condition is that he must not leave India without the previous permission of the trial court/Investigating Officer. This condition is imposed to ensure that the applicant does not flee the country while he is out on bail. If he leaves the country without permission, his bail may be canceled, and he may be declared an absconder.

The court has granted bail to the applicant on the condition that he complies with all the terms and conditions of the bond. If he fails to comply with any of the conditions, his bail may be canceled, and he may be sent back to custody.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Kodu Prasad Panika on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and one surety of the same amount.
