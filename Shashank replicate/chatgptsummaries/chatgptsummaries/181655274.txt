The Uttarakhand Environment Protection & Pollution Control Board had passed an order directing the closure of M/s Dex Agro Sweetners (Private) Limited's factory for not having an Effluent Treatment Plant in working condition. However, the petitioner challenged the order on the grounds that the Board had not given a 15-day prior notice as required under Rule 34 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the petitioner against the Board.

The court directed the Board to give a post-decisional hearing to the petitioner and pass a fresh order after considering all relevant parameters and pleas of the petitioner. This means that the Board will have to hear the petitioner's side of the story and take into account any relevant information or arguments that the petitioner may have. The Board will then have to pass a fresh order based on this information.

The court's decision is significant because it upholds the principle of natural justice, which requires that all parties be given a fair hearing before a decision is made. In this case, the Board had not given the petitioner a chance to be heard before passing the closure order. The court's decision ensures that the petitioner's right to be heard is respected and that the Board's decision is based on all relevant information.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of complying with the rules and regulations set out in the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Rule 34 of the Act requires that a 15-day prior notice be given before any closure order is passed. The Board's failure to comply with this rule was a key factor in the court's decision to quash the closure order.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a victory for the petitioner and for the principles of natural justice. It ensures that the petitioner's right to be heard is respected and that the Board's decision is based on all relevant information. It also highlights the importance of complying with the rules and regulations set out in the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.
