The court order in question pertains to a case where the applicant had filed a criminal complaint against respondents and had requested the record of a criminal case pending in another court. The trial court had requisitioned the record, but the Magistrate later directed for its return. The applicant filed a criminal revision, which was dismissed. The applicant then filed an application under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., which was also dismissed by the court, stating that the Magistrate had not committed any mistake or illegality in directing for the return of the record.

The court emphasized the importance of speedy trial and stated that requisitioning the record of a criminal case pending in another court cannot hamper proceedings in another criminal case.

The court also observed that the Magistrate had acted within his jurisdiction in directing for the return of the record.

The court noted that the applicant had failed to make out a case for interference under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.

The court also observed that the record of a criminal case pending in another court can be requisitioned only for the purpose of facilitating the trial of the case before the court requisitioning the record. The court noted that the record cannot be requisitioned for any other purpose, such as for filing a complaint or for any other proceeding.

The court emphasized that the speedy trial is a fundamental right of the accused and that any delay in the trial can cause prejudice to the accused. The court noted that the return of the record in the present case was in accordance with the principles of speedy trial and that the Magistrate had not committed any mistake or illegality in directing for the return of the record.
