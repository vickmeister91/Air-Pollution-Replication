The court recently dismissed a petition filed by Umesh Shrivastava under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the JMFC, Chhatarpur in criminal case no. 2222/2011. The application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. filed by the applicant for taking the CD on record was also dismissed. The court found that no such pleading had been made in the complaint that the applicant had prepared such CD and it should be taken on record. The trial court had rightly dismissed the application filed by the applicant, and there was no illegality or perversity visible in the impugned order.

The case in question involved a complaint filed by the applicant against certain individuals, alleging that they had committed various offenses under the Indian Penal Code. The trial court had taken cognizance of the complaint and had issued summons to the accused persons. During the course of the trial, the applicant had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. for taking a CD on record. The CD in question contained certain recordings that the applicant claimed were relevant to the case.

However, the trial court had dismissed the application, stating that there was no pleading in the complaint that the applicant had prepared such CD and it should be taken on record. The applicant had then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court, challenging the order passed by the trial court.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court observed that the trial court had rightly dismissed the application filed by the applicant, as there was no pleading in the complaint that the CD in question had been prepared by the applicant and should be taken on record. The court further noted that the trial court had considered all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case before passing the impugned order, and there was no illegality or perversity visible in the order.

The court also observed that the power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear case of abuse of process of the court or where the ends of justice require interference. In the present case, the court found that there was no such abuse of process of the court or requirement of interference in the impugned order.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petition filed by the applicant and upheld the order passed by the trial court. The court reiterated that the power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. should be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there is a clear case of abuse of process of the court or where the ends of justice require interference. The court also emphasized the importance of making proper pleadings in the complaint, so as to avoid any confusion or ambiguity during the course of the trial.
