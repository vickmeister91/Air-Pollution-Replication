The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a criminal petition filed by M/s Janapriya Engineers and its Chairman, Sri K. Ravindra Reddy, seeking to quash proceedings against them for offences under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners contended that the complaint was not filed by the authorized officer as required under Section 49 of the Act. However, the court observed that if the accused felt there was no proper authorization, they were at liberty to raise such a contention before the trial court.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to prevent and control water pollution in India. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control water pollution. The Act also provides for the appointment of authorized officers who are responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act.

In the present case, the petitioners had been charged with offences under the Act for allegedly discharging untreated sewage into a lake in Bangalore. The complaint had been filed by a junior engineer of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and the petitioners had contended that he was not an authorized officer as required under Section 49 of the Act. The petitioners had argued that the complaint was therefore invalid and the proceedings against them should be quashed.

The court, however, rejected this argument and held that the petitioners were not entitled to quash the proceedings at this stage. The court observed that the question of whether the complainant was an authorized officer or not was a matter of evidence that could be raised before the trial court. The court also noted that the petitioners had not produced any material to show that the complainant was not an authorized officer.

The court further observed that the purpose of Section 49 of the Act was to ensure that only authorized officers file complaints under the Act. The court held that the requirement of authorization was not a condition precedent for the filing of a complaint, and that the absence of authorization did not render the complaint invalid. The court also noted that the petitioners had not challenged the jurisdiction of the court or the validity of the complaint on any other ground.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision in this case reaffirms the importance of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, in preventing and controlling water pollution in India. The court's decision also underscores the need for strict enforcement of the Act, and the role of authorized officers in ensuring compliance with its provisions. The court's decision also highlights the importance of evidence in criminal proceedings, and the need for parties to raise their contentions before the appropriate forum.
