The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision against the dismissal of an application filed by the accused under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The accused had requested the production of certain statements made by witnesses that were allegedly in the possession of the prosecution but not filed along with the charge sheet. The trial court dismissed the application, and the accused filed a criminal revision against the order. However, the court found that the order was interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable under sub-section 2 of Section 397 of the Cr.P.C.

The court noted that the accused had not produced a certified copy of the alleged statements made by the witnesses, and the incomplete copy of the explanation submitted by Tek Singh Thakur was not admissible. As a result, the criminal revision was dismissed.

The case at hand involves a request by the accused for the production of certain statements made by witnesses that were allegedly in the possession of the prosecution but not filed along with the charge sheet. The accused filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. requesting the production of these statements. However, the trial court dismissed the application, prompting the accused to file a criminal revision against the order.

The court, however, found that the order was interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable under sub-section 2 of Section 397 of the Cr.P.C. The court also noted that the accused had not produced a certified copy of the alleged statements made by the witnesses, and the incomplete copy of the explanation submitted by Tek Singh Thakur was not admissible.

The court's decision to dismiss the criminal revision was based on several factors. First, the court found that the order in question was interlocutory in nature and therefore not maintainable under sub-section 2 of Section 397 of the Cr.P.C. This means that the accused could not file a criminal revision against the order.

Second, the court noted that the accused had not produced a certified copy of the alleged statements made by the witnesses. This is a requirement under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. and failure to produce such a copy can result in the dismissal of the application.

Finally, the court found that the incomplete copy of the explanation submitted by Tek Singh Thakur was not admissible. This means that the accused could not rely on this document as evidence in support of their application.

In light of these factors, the court dismissed the criminal revision filed by the accused. This means that the trial court's order dismissing the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. stands.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of following the proper procedures and requirements when filing applications under the Cr.P.C. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of the application and the loss of the opportunity to obtain the evidence needed to support one's case.
