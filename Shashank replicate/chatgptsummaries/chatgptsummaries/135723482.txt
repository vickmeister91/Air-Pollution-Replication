The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and Rohit Prajapati. The case revolved around a circular issued by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2002 that allowed for ex post facto environmental clearances. The National Green Tribunal for the Western Zone held that the circular was contrary to law and issued several directions, including the revocation of environmental clearances and the closing down of industrial units operating without valid consents. The affected industrial units and MoEF appealed the decision. 

The EIA notification of 1994 mandated prior Environmental Clearances for setting up and expansion of industrial projects falling within thirty categories. The circular of 14 May 2002 extended the deadline for obtaining an EC for industrial units that had gone into production without obtaining an EC under the EIA notification of 1994. The circular was challenged by the first and second respondents before the High Court of Gujarat and subsequently transferred to the NGT. The NGT held that the law did not permit the grant of an ex post facto clearance and issued several directions, including the revocation of ECs granted to industrial units and the closing down of industrial activities being operated without a valid EC and consent to operate. The private respondents affected by the directions were United Phosphorous Ltd, Unique Chemicals, Darshak Private Limited, and Nirayu Private Limited. Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited was the appellant in the lead appeal before the Supreme Court. 

The EIA notification of 1994 stipulated that any person who desired to undertake a new project or the expansion or modernisation of an existing industry listed in Schedule-I shall submit an application to the Secretary, MoEF. The notification spelt out the procedure to be followed upon the submission of the application, including an evaluation and assessment by a stipulated agency. The court order discusses a circular issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in 2002, which allowed industrial units to obtain ex post facto environmental clearances (ECs) for units that had been set up without prior ECs. The circular was challenged in court, and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) set it aside in 2016. The issue being adjudicated is whether the circular was valid, given the requirement of a prior EC under the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) notification of 1994. The court also considers arguments made by Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited, which had already obtained ECs for subsequent expansions of their units. The court ultimately upholds the NGT's decision to set aside the circular.

The court order pertains to a case where certain industrial units were challenged for operating without valid environmental clearances. The appellants argued that they had all the requisite permissions and clearances, and that the NGT's order to shut down their operations would cause them irreparable loss. The court considered the arguments of both parties and also addressed the issue of the NGT's jurisdiction to strike down rules or regulations made under the Environment Protection Act 1986. The court ultimately upheld the appellants' contentions and allowed them to continue their operations, while also noting the need for compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

The court order states that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) does not have the power to strike down rules or regulations made under the Environment Protection Act 1986. The court relied on a previous decision in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited v Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, which interpreted the appellate power contained in Section 14 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act 1997. The court also discussed a circular dated 14 May 2002 that extended the deadline for defaulting units to obtain an ex post facto clearance until 30 March 2003. The circular was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) pursuant to its powers under Section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986. However, the court found that the circular was not a measure for the purpose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution, as required by Section 3. The court also rejected the argument that the EIA notification dated 27 January 1994 did not require a prior environmental clearance.

The court order states that the concept of an ex post facto environmental clearance (EC) is against environmental jurisprudence and the EIA notification of 1994. It is detrimental to the environment and could lead to irreparable degradation. An EC can only be issued after various stages of the decision-making process have been completed, including conducting a public hearing, screening, scoping, and appraisal. Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC, which would be contrary to the precautionary principle and sustainable development. The order also includes tables listing permissions, consents, and authorizations granted to Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited, United Phosphorus Limited, and Unique Chemicals Limited. It also lists the environmental clearances granted to Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited and Nirayu Private Limited.

The court order discusses the environmental clearances and authorizations granted to three different chemical manufacturing units in India. The order lists the dates of application, public hearing, and grant of environmental clearances for each unit, as well as the products and quantities they are authorized to manufacture. The order notes that the applications for environmental clearances were submitted years after
