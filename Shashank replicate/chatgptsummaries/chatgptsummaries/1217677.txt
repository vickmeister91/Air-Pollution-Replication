The recent court order pertains to a writ petition filed by India Rural Reconstruction and Society against the Government of India and others. The petitioner sought to declare the government's action in issuing a letter and consequential orders as illegal, arbitrary, and violative of the Environment Protection Act, 1986. The case pertains to the protection of coastal areas and the regulation of activities in the vicinity of seawaters, rivers, and creeks.

The court examined the Coastal Zone Management Plan and the slab system for demarcating Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) along the banks of rivers, creeks, and backwaters. The slab system is a method of demarcating the CRZ based on the distance from the High Tide Line (HTL). The slab system divides the CRZ into four categories, namely CRZ-I, CRZ-II, CRZ-III, and CRZ-IV, based on the distance from the HTL.

The court held that the slab system is not violative of the provisions of the CRZ notification and is not inimical to the fragile coastal ecology of the state. The court observed that the slab system is a scientific method of demarcating the CRZ and is based on the recommendations of the Shailesh Nayak Committee. The court also noted that the slab system has been in use for several years and has been accepted by the government and the public.

The court further observed that the slab system is necessary to protect the coastal areas from the adverse impact of human activities. The court noted that the coastal areas are ecologically sensitive and are home to several species of flora and fauna. The court held that the slab system is necessary to ensure that the development activities in the coastal areas are carried out in a sustainable manner and do not cause any harm to the environment.

The court also examined the issue of the demarcation of the CRZ along the banks of rivers, creeks, and backwaters. The court observed that the slab system is not applicable in these areas as the HTL is not clearly demarcated. The court held that the demarcation of the CRZ in these areas should be based on the recommendations of the Shailesh Nayak Committee and the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

The court also examined the issue of the regulation of activities in the CRZ. The court observed that the CRZ notification prohibits certain activities in the CRZ, such as construction of buildings, mining, and setting up of industries. The court held that the government should ensure that the activities in the CRZ are regulated in a manner that does not cause any harm to the environment.

In conclusion, the court held that the slab system for demarcating the CRZ is a scientific method and is not violative of the provisions of the CRZ notification. The court also held that the demarcation of the CRZ along the banks of rivers, creeks, and backwaters should be based on the recommendations of the Shailesh Nayak Committee and the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. The court directed the government to ensure that the activities in the CRZ are regulated in a manner that does not cause any harm to the environment. The writ petition was disposed of, and the interim orders passed by the court were vacated.
