The Supreme Court recently granted permission to file an appeal in the case of Himachal Grit Udyog vs Union of India. The case involves stone crushing units operating within 100 meters of water bodies in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The National Green Tribunal had quashed the consent to operate granted to these units. The stone crushing units argued that they were not given a chance to present their perspective in the proceedings. The Solicitor General, representing the State of Himachal Pradesh, argued that the Tribunal's direction would cause dislocation and that the State should have been made aware of the direction beforehand. The Court directed the State Government to address the issue before the Tribunal based on scientific data.
