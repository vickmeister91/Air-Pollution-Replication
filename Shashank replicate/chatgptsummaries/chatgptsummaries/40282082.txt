The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment on a writ petition filed by M Krishnappa and others against the State of Karnataka and others. The petitioners sought to prohibit the respondents from constructing any structure on land bearing survey number 27/2 of Koudenahalli village. The petitioners claimed that the land was a tank bed area and forest land, and the construction of a government school building on the land was illegal.

The court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioners had suppressed material facts and could file a separate writ petition if interested. The court observed that the petitioners had not disclosed that the land in question was already the subject of a litigation in the Karnataka High Court. The court also noted that the petitioners had not disclosed that the land had been acquired by the government for the purpose of constructing a school building.

The court further observed that the petitioners had not produced any evidence to support their claim that the land was a tank bed area and forest land. The court noted that the revenue records showed that the land was classified as 'dry land' and was not a tank bed area or forest land.

The court also observed that the petitioners had not challenged the acquisition of the land by the government. The court noted that the acquisition of the land had been done in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, and the petitioners had not challenged the acquisition within the stipulated time period.

The court held that the petitioners had suppressed material facts and had not made a full and frank disclosure of all the relevant facts. The court observed that the suppression of material facts was a serious matter and could result in the dismissal of the petition.

The court also held that the petitioners could file a separate writ petition challenging the acquisition of the land by the government. The court observed that the petitioners had not challenged the acquisition within the stipulated time period, but they could still file a writ petition challenging the acquisition on the grounds of illegality or irregularity.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by M Krishnappa and others against the State of Karnataka and others. The court held that the petitioners had suppressed material facts and could file a separate writ petition challenging the acquisition of the land by the government. The court observed that the acquisition of the land had been done in accordance with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, and the petitioners had not challenged the acquisition within the stipulated time period. The court also noted that the petitioners had not produced any evidence to support their claim that the land was a tank bed area and forest land.
