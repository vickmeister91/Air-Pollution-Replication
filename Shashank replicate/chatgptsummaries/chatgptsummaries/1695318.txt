The court order in question pertains to a public interest petition filed by Dev Sebastian against P.R. Kurup and others. Sebastian alleged that Kurup, a minister, had violated the oath of office by giving a No Objection Certificate to a sandalwood factory in violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Sebastian also alleged corruption and requested an inquiry by the Chief Minister.

The Advocate General denied the allegations, stating that no such certificate was given. The court held that the allegations were based solely on newspaper reports without supporting evidence and dismissed the petition with costs. The court also stated that it cannot interfere in matters of breach of oath by a minister and that approaching the court solely on the basis of newspaper reports without personal inquiry should be discouraged.

The court's decision was based on several factors. First, the court found that the allegations made by Sebastian were based solely on newspaper reports and lacked any supporting evidence. This lack of evidence made it difficult for the court to determine the veracity of the allegations.

Second, the court found that the allegations pertained to a breach of oath by a minister, which is a matter that falls within the purview of the legislature and not the judiciary. The court stated that it cannot interfere in matters of breach of oath by a minister and that such matters should be dealt with by the legislature.

Third, the court found that approaching the court solely on the basis of newspaper reports without personal inquiry should be discouraged. The court stated that it is important for individuals to conduct their own investigations and gather evidence before approaching the court with allegations of wrongdoing.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of evidence and personal inquiry when making allegations of wrongdoing. It also underscores the limitations of the judiciary in matters of breach of oath by a minister, which are better left to the legislature.
