The court order in question relates to a petition filed by Harisingh, also known as Harish or Harishchand, seeking regular bail in a case registered against him under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner had been in custody since April 5, 2017, but was not apprehended at the scene of the alleged crime.

After considering the petition, the court granted bail to the petitioner subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. This means that the petitioner will be released from custody, but must comply with certain conditions set by the Trial Court in order to remain free.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is a law designed to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals, while Section 51 deals with penalties for offences under the Act. The Act is intended to prevent the illegal hunting and poaching of wildlife, as well as the destruction of their habitats.

The decision to grant bail to the petitioner in this case was likely based on a number of factors, including the nature of the alleged offence, the strength of the evidence against the petitioner, and the petitioner's criminal history. The court may have also considered the petitioner's personal circumstances, such as their age, health, and family situation, when making its decision.

It is important to note that the granting of bail does not mean that the petitioner has been found innocent of the charges against them. Rather, it simply means that they will be released from custody while they await trial. The Trial Court will ultimately determine whether the petitioner is guilty or innocent of the charges against them.

In conclusion, the court order in this case granted bail to Harisingh, also known as Harish or Harishchand, who had been in custody since April 5, 2017, in connection with a case registered against him under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The decision to grant bail was subject to the satisfaction of the Trial Court, and was likely based on a number of factors, including the nature of the alleged offence, the strength of the evidence against the petitioner, and the petitioner's personal circumstances. It is important to remember that the granting of bail does not mean that the petitioner has been found innocent of the charges against them, and that the Trial Court will ultimately determine their guilt or innocence.
