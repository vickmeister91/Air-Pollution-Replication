The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Jaswant Singh and others against the State of Rajasthan and various officials regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water. The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court ordered the State to come up with short and long term plans to remove encroachments and contamination from canal waters and distributories. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The court also ordered the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The court requested the High Court of Rajasthan to hand over the records of the case to them. The State was directed to submit a report on the steps taken for construction of waste water drains and removal of encroachments. The court warned that a cost of Rs. 50,000/- would be imposed if the State failed to comply. The District Collector was directed to be present with all relevant records on the next date of hearing.

The court order pertains to a case of encroachment and pollution of canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan. The court directed the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation of Rs. 25,000 and deposit it in the Environmental Relief Fund. The court also directed the removal of existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal as they were causing contamination of canal water. The state government was ordered to file a compliance report. The court expressed dissatisfaction with the state's lethargic attitude and warned of appropriate action if directions were not complied with.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachments on the Indira Gandhi Canal in Sri Ganganagar and the lack of compliance with previous orders from the Tribunal. The Chief Engineer of Water Resources was asked to provide an affidavit with complete details of the action taken by the government, but it was found to be lacking. The District Collector was ordered to appear before the Tribunal to provide relevant information and records. The court suggests that those aggrieved by the actions of the authorities should approach the NGT, which has jurisdiction over civil cases involving environmental issues. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court order states that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued even if a remedy of appeal/revision is available on arriving at a conclusion that an inferior court or Tribunal of first instance has committed an error so patent that may not be cured or obliterated by adopting the other statutory remedy. However, the court has discretion in deciding whether to invoke writ jurisdiction or not. In this particular case, the court has dismissed the writ petition and allowed the petitioner(s) to withdraw the petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by way of filing appropriate application/representation in the Original Application Nos.86 to 89 of 2014 and 322/2015. The NGT is expected to consider the application/representations filed by petitioner(s) sympathetically.
