The court order in question pertains to an appeal against an order by the Subordinate Judge regarding the determination of the period within which mesne profits shall be payable. The appellant had challenged the order on the grounds that it amounted to a decree within the meaning of the definition in the Code of Civil Procedure. The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, determined that an appeal did indeed lie as the order by the Subordinate Judge amounted to a decree.

The court also ruled that the Court-fee payable is an ad valorem fee and allowed the appellant time to amend the valuation in his plaint. This was in response to the appellant's argument that the valuation of the suit for mesne profits was incorrect and that the Court-fee payable should be reduced accordingly. The court noted that a suit for mesne profits is to be assessed with an ad valorem fee and that the old practice of allowing plaintiffs to include a suit for money as mesne profits without paying any Court-fee upon the mesne profits was wrong.

Mesne profits refer to the profits that a person in wrongful possession of property is deemed to have received from the property during the period of such wrongful possession. The determination of the period within which mesne profits shall be payable is an important aspect of such cases, as it determines the amount of compensation that the plaintiff is entitled to receive. In this case, the Subordinate Judge had determined that the period within which mesne profits shall be payable was three years, which the appellant had challenged.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position with respect to the Court-fee payable in suits for mesne profits. The court has held that such suits are to be assessed with an ad valorem fee, which means that the Court-fee payable is a percentage of the value of the subject matter of the suit. This is in contrast to the old practice of allowing plaintiffs to include a suit for money as mesne profits without paying any Court-fee upon the mesne profits.

The court has also allowed the appellant time to amend the valuation in his plaint, which is a significant relief for the appellant. This will enable the appellant to reduce the Court-fee payable and ensure that he is not burdened with an excessive Court-fee. The court has also clarified that the determination of the period within which mesne profits shall be payable is a matter of fact and that the Subordinate Judge's determination of three years was not erroneous.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an appeal against an order by the Subordinate Judge regarding the determination of the period within which mesne profits shall be payable. The court has clarified the legal position with respect to the Court-fee payable in suits for mesne profits and has allowed the appellant time to amend the valuation in his plaint. The court has also held that the determination of the period within which mesne profits shall be payable is a matter of fact and that the Subordinate Judge's determination of three years was not erroneous. This order is significant as it provides clarity on an important aspect of mesne profits cases and will have far-reaching implications for such cases in the future.
