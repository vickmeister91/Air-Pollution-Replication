The first court order pertains to a discharge application filed by accused no. 2 seeking discharge and framing of notice. The accused claims that there was a misuse of provisions of law and false allegations in the complaint. The accused society is not responsible for any statutory lapses and is entitled to discharge. The complainant denies all material facts and states that the application is premature. The court considers the submissions of both parties and relevant provisions of law before making a decision. The court also reproduces relevant provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules.

The court notes that the accused society is a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) Society, which is responsible for treating the effluent generated by the member industries before discharging it into the environment. The court observes that the society is bound by the provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules, and any violation of these provisions can lead to legal action against the society.

The court also notes that the accused society has raised the issue of statutory lapses and argues that it cannot be held responsible for the same. However, the court observes that the society cannot absolve itself of its responsibilities under the law by citing statutory lapses. The court also notes that the accused society has not produced any evidence to support its claim of false allegations in the complaint.

The court reproduces relevant provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules, which mandate that the CETP Society obtain necessary clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court observes that any agreement contrary to the statutes is void.

After considering the submissions of both parties and relevant provisions of law, the court dismisses the discharge application filed by accused no. 2 and frames charges against the accused society. The court observes that there is sufficient material on record to proceed against the accused society and that the application filed by accused no. 2 is premature.

The second court order pertains to a case involving the discharge of sewage and trade effluent into streams, wells, sewers, or land. The court found that the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Rules, 2001, mandate that the CETP Society obtain necessary clearances under the Environment (Protection) Act, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, and Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court also noted that any agreement contrary to the statutes is void. The court rejected the argument that the CETP Society is not an industry and therefore not bound by the rules. The court also dismissed the argument that the complaint was not filed on behalf of the appropriate authority.

The court notes that the complaint filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee alleges that the accused society has been discharging untreated sewage and trade effluent into the environment, which is in violation of the provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules. The court observes that the accused society is a CETP Society and is therefore bound by the provisions of the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Rules, 2001.

The court rejects the argument of the accused society that it is not an industry and therefore not bound by the rules. The court observes that the definition of "industry" under the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules is wide enough to include a CETP Society. The court also notes that any agreement contrary to the statutes is void and that the accused society cannot rely on such agreements to escape liability.

The court also dismisses the argument of the accused society that the complaint was not filed on behalf of the appropriate authority. The court observes that the Delhi Pollution Control Committee is the appropriate authority to file such a complaint and that there is no merit in the argument of the accused society.

After considering the submissions of both parties and relevant provisions of law, the court directs the accused society to comply with the provisions of the Water Act, Air Act, and DCET Rules and imposes a cost of Rs. 10,000 to be deposited with DLSA.

The third court order pertains to a complaint filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee against M/s GTK Road Industrial Estate CETP Society & Ors. The complaint is filed under various sections of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act and the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plant Act. The court dismisses the contention that the complaint is premature and observes that the application appears to have been filed with a view to delay the proceedings. The court orders the case to be put up for pre-charge evidence on a specified date and imposes a cost of Rs. 10,000 to be deposited with DLSA.

The court notes that the complaint filed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee alleges that the accused society has been discharging untreated sewage and trade effluent into the environment, which is in violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act and the Delhi Common Effluent Treatment Plant Act.
