The National Green Tribunal recently heard an appeal by P.S. Vajiravel, proprietor of M/s. Shivashakthi Dyeing, against an order by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to close his dyeing unit. The appellant claimed that the order was issued due to collusion between the lessor of the land and the mother of the new owner, who is a politician and the present Mayor of Erode. The respondents, on the other hand, claimed that the order was issued because the lease period had expired and the unit was operating without valid consent.

The Tribunal considered the arguments and evidence presented by both parties and will decide whether to set aside the order of closure. This case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that decisions are made based on facts and evidence rather than personal interests or biases.

In another court order related to the closure of a dyeing unit, the TNPCB had ordered the closure of a unit due to the expiry of the lease agreement of the land on which the unit was constructed. The owner of the unit had complied with the norms for effluent discharge and had applied for renewal of the consent to operate.

However, the TNPCB's order of closure was found to be arbitrary and invalid as it was based on a letter from the landowner and did not consider the pendency of a civil suit and an interim injunction in favor of the unit owner. The court directed the TNPCB to issue a renewal letter of consent to operate and the electricity board to restore power to the unit.

This case highlights the importance of following due process and ensuring that decisions are made based on facts and evidence rather than personal interests or biases. It also emphasizes the need for regulatory bodies to consider all relevant factors before making decisions that can have a significant impact on businesses and individuals.

In conclusion, these court orders demonstrate the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that decisions are made based on facts and evidence rather than personal interests or biases. They also highlight the need for regulatory bodies to consider all relevant factors before making decisions that can have a significant impact on businesses and individuals. By following due process and ensuring that decisions are made based on objective criteria, we can promote fairness and justice in our society.
