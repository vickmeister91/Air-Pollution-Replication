The court order involves a dispute between M.O.H. Leathers Ltd. and Indian Bank regarding the release of funds for export purposes. The complainant alleges that the bank failed to release funds for further production, causing them to suffer huge losses. The bank denies agreeing to a rehabilitation program and claims that the complainant did not fulfill the requirements for consideration. The complainant is seeking a sum of Rs. 7,15,93,848/-, mental pain and agony compensation, interest, and cost of litigation.

In this case, M.O.H. Leathers Ltd. has filed a complaint against Indian Bank for not releasing funds for further production, which has caused them to suffer huge losses. The complainant alleges that the bank had agreed to a rehabilitation program, but failed to release the funds as promised. On the other hand, the bank denies agreeing to any such program and claims that the complainant did not fulfill the requirements for consideration.

The court has heard both sides of the argument and has come to a decision. The court has found that the complainant did not fulfill the requirements for a rehabilitation program by the OP and filed the complaint out of frustration and as a counterblast to the application filed by the OP for recovery of loan dues. The court has also found that the complainant's allegations were not maintainable and that the consumer fora did not have jurisdiction to try the case.

The court has dismissed the complaint and advised the complainant to seek remedy elsewhere. The court has also noted that the complainant's grievances should have been ventilated before the DRT, Chennai, and that the complainant had missed the bus. This means that the complainant should have taken their case to the Debt Recovery Tribunal in Chennai, but they missed the opportunity to do so.

In conclusion, the court has dismissed the complaint filed by M.O.H. Leathers Ltd. against Indian Bank. The court has found that the complainant did not fulfill the requirements for a rehabilitation program and that the consumer fora did not have jurisdiction to try the case. The court has advised the complainant to seek remedy elsewhere and has noted that the complainant's grievances should have been ventilated before the DRT, Chennai.
