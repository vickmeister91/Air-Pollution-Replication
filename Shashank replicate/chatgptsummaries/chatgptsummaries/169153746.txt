In a recent court order, the accused Shayar was granted bail after being in custody for an offense under the Wildlife Protection Act and IPC Section 427/34. The court took into consideration the fact that other co-accused who were similarly situated had been granted bail and ordered Shayar's release on a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- and two surety bonds of Rs.25,000/- each.

The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas.

IPC Section 427/34 deals with the offense of mischief causing damage to property. The section provides for punishment for anyone who commits an act of mischief that causes damage to property. The punishment for this offense can range from imprisonment for up to two years, a fine, or both.

The accused is not required to deposit any money with the court, but they may be required to provide surety bonds. A surety bond is a type of bond where a third party guarantees the accused's appearance in court.
