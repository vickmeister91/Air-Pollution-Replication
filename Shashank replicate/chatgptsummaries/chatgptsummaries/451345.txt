The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by a pastor seeking to quash a notice issued by the Tahsildar directing him not to conduct prayer meetings until peace talks were completed. The pastor challenged the notice on the grounds that it violated his fundamental right to freedom of religion. The court noted that while this right is protected under the Constitution, it is subject to public order, morality, and health. The court also cited a previous case where the Supreme Court had held that the State can act in the larger public interest. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses the issue of noise pollution caused by religious activities and the need to balance the rights of individuals with the public order, morality, and health. The court cites relevant statutory provisions and rules and emphasizes the need for their enforcement. The court also states that there is no need for prior permission to conduct prayers in a dwelling place as long as it does not cause nuisance or disturbance to others. However, if there is any infringement of the rights of others, the authorities can take necessary action under relevant statutes.

The court order states that the petitioner is allowed to conduct prayers in his dwelling place as long as it does not cause disturbance to others or hindrance to the general public. The directions issued by the Second Respondent to attend peace talks with the Hindu Munnani Party and restraining the petitioner from conducting prayers until the talks are concluded are without authority of law and cannot be sustained. However, the petitioner must ensure that no hindrance or disturbance is caused to the general public while conducting prayers, and authorities can take necessary action under relevant statutes if any nuisance is caused. The writ petition is disposed of with these observations, and no costs are imposed. The order is to be issued by June 19, 2019.
