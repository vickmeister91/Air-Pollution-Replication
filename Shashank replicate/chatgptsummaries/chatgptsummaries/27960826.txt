The court order in question pertains to two repeat bail applications filed by Hariom and Shivnarayan, who are accused of violating the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants' counsel argued that no recovery had been made from them and they had no past criminal antecedents. The court allowed both bail applications and directed the applicants to furnish cash and personal bonds before the trial court and abide by all conditions under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that seeks to protect India's rich biodiversity and wildlife. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and wildlife products. Violations of the Act can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Hariom and Shivnarayan were accused of violating the Act, and had been arrested by the authorities. They had previously filed bail applications, which had been rejected by the court. However, they filed repeat bail applications, arguing that they had no past criminal antecedents and that no recovery had been made from them.

The court considered their arguments and allowed both bail applications. However, the court also directed the applicants to furnish cash and personal bonds before the trial court, and to abide by all conditions under Section 437(3) of the Cr.P.C. This section provides for certain conditions that must be met by a person seeking bail, including that they must not commit any offence while on bail, and that they must cooperate with the investigation.

The court's decision to grant bail to Hariom and Shivnarayan is significant, as it highlights the importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to bail. The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle of criminal law, which holds that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The right to bail is also a crucial aspect of criminal law, as it allows a person to be released from custody while awaiting trial.

However, it is important to note that the right to bail is not absolute, and can be restricted in certain circumstances. For example, if there is a risk that the accused may flee or tamper with evidence, bail may be denied. Similarly, if the accused has a history of committing similar offences, bail may be denied.

In this case, the court considered the arguments put forward by the applicants' counsel, and found that there was no evidence to suggest that they posed a flight risk or that they would tamper with evidence. The court also noted that they had no past criminal antecedents. As a result, the court granted them bail, subject to certain conditions.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Hariom and Shivnarayan highlights the importance of the presumption of innocence and the right to bail. However, it is important to note that the right to bail is not absolute, and can be restricted in certain circumstances. In this case, the court considered the arguments put forward by the applicants' counsel, and found that there was no evidence to suggest that they posed a flight risk or that they would tamper with evidence. As a result, the court granted them bail, subject to certain conditions.
