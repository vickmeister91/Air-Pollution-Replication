The court order pertains to a chamber summons filed by Twinkle Jatin Khanna, daughter of the late Rajesh Khanna, seeking to set aside an order rejecting her review petition and dismissing a respondent's application for certified copies of probate proceedings. The court provides relevant background information, including the granting of probate in respect of the deceased's will, the filing of a complaint by the respondent under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005, and the respondent's application for certified copies of probate proceedings. The court ultimately dismisses the applicant's chamber summons.

In another court order, both parties were allowed to file submissions and heard through their learned Counsel. The applicant was challenging the dismissal of their review petition by the learned Commissioner for taking accounts. The applicant argued that the Prothonotary and Senior Master must give notice and an opportunity to be heard to a party whose personal financial and sensitive details are ordered to be furnished to a third party. The applicant also argued that the respondent had no tangible interest in the proceedings and failed to show that she was a legal heir of the deceased. The applicant cited previous judgments in support of their arguments.

The court order discusses an application for certified copies of court proceedings. The Division Bench granted the request, stating that there was no possibility of misuse and that the respondent had a right to the copies. The appellant argued that the copies would be used to harass them, but the court disagreed. The court also clarified that the grant of certified copies did not automatically entitle the respondent to participate in the proceedings. The appellant also argued that the Prothonotary and Senior Master should have exercised their discretionary power with caution and given notice before granting the copies, but the court found no fault with their decision. The respondent argued that they had a tangible interest in the estate of the deceased and wanted to file a petition for revocation of the probate obtained by the appellant and their family members fraudulently and by committing forgery. The court found that the respondent had a right to seek revocation of the probate under section 263 of the Indian Succession Act 1925.

The court order states that the Prothonotary and Senior Master has the discretion to grant or deny certified copies of documents to a person who is not a party to the suit or matter. The court also held that it is not necessary for the Prothonotary and Senior Master to decide the merits or de-merits of any proposed legal proceedings by the third party when considering an application for certified copies. The court rejected the review petition filed by the applicant and held that the principles of natural justice were complied with. The court also considered whether the Prothonotary and Senior Master was required to issue notice to the applicant before considering the application of the respondent for certified copies.

In the final court order, the respondent had already filed criminal proceedings against the applicant and her family members and required the papers and proceedings for the purpose of filing a petition for revocation of the probate obtained by the applicant and her family members. The Prothonotary and Senior Master has discretionary power to grant certified copy of the record and proceedings if sufficient cause is shown. The court held that the Prothonotary and Senior Master had exercised his discretion on having been satisfied that sufficient cause was shown for issuance of certified copies, and this Court shall not interfere with such discretion exercised by the learned Prothonotary and Senior Master. The court dismissed the chamber summon and refused the application for continuation of stay.

In summary, these court orders all pertain to a probate matter involving the late Rajesh Khanna and his estate. The orders discuss various applications for certified copies of court proceedings and the discretion of the Prothonotary and Senior Master in granting or denying such requests. The court also considers the rights of third parties to seek revocation of probate and the principles of natural justice in the proceedings. Ultimately, the court dismisses the applicant's chamber summons and refuses the application for continuation of stay.
