The Patna High Court has granted bail to Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh, who were accused in a case related to illegal mining and transportation of minerals, air pollution, and environmental protection. The court ordered them to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount and attend court regularly for at least two years or until the case is disposed of. Failure to attend court without a reasonable explanation would result in the cancellation of the bail.

The case against Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh was related to illegal mining and transportation of minerals, air pollution, and environmental protection. The two were accused of violating various environmental laws and regulations, including the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The case was filed by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) in 2019.

The BSPCB had alleged that Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh were involved in illegal mining and transportation of minerals from the Kaimur hills in Bihar. The mining activities were causing air pollution and environmental damage in the area. The BSPCB had also alleged that the two had violated various environmental laws and regulations, including the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.

The case had been under investigation for some time, and Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh had been arrested in connection with the case. They had been in judicial custody for several months before being granted bail by the Patna High Court.

The court granted bail to Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh on the condition that they furnish a bail bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court also ordered them to attend court regularly for at least two years or until the case is disposed of. Failure to attend court without a reasonable explanation would result in the cancellation of the bail.

The court's decision to grant bail to Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh has been welcomed by their supporters. They have argued that the two were innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. They have also argued that the case against them was politically motivated and aimed at tarnishing their reputation.

However, the decision has been criticized by environmental activists and organizations. They have argued that the court's decision sends a wrong message and undermines the efforts to protect the environment. They have also argued that the court's decision could encourage others to violate environmental laws and regulations without fear of punishment.

The case against Rakesh Singh and Raju Singh is still ongoing, and it remains to be seen how it will be resolved. The court's decision to grant bail to the two accused has raised questions about the effectiveness of the legal system in dealing with environmental crimes. It has also highlighted the need for stricter enforcement of environmental laws and regulations to protect the environment and ensure sustainable development.
