The Kerala High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by a petitioner against the Environmental Engineer and the Pariyaram Grama Panchayath. The petitioner sought a writ in the nature of mandamus to ensure that no manufacturing or commercial activity is conducted by the third respondent in building No.14/2/7C of Pariyaram Gramapanchayath without obtaining consent to operate under the Environment Protection Act and (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act.

The court directed the first respondent to consider the application put in by the third respondent and finalize the proceedings at the earliest, after hearing both sides. The second respondent was directed to consider and pass orders on Ext.P4 at the earliest, within six weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties concerned.

The writ petition was filed in response to concerns about potential environmental damage caused by the third respondent's manufacturing or commercial activities. The petitioner argued that the third respondent should not be allowed to conduct any such activities without obtaining the necessary consent to operate under the relevant environmental protection laws.

The court's decision to direct the first respondent to consider the third respondent's application and finalize the proceedings at the earliest is significant. It suggests that the court is taking the issue of environmental protection seriously and is keen to ensure that all necessary steps are taken to prevent any potential harm to the environment.

The court's decision to direct the second respondent to consider and pass orders on Ext.P4 within six weeks is also significant. This suggests that the court is keen to ensure that the matter is resolved quickly and that all parties concerned are given an opportunity to be heard.

Overall, the court's decision in this case is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental protection laws are enforced and that potential environmental damage is prevented. It is important that all parties concerned take the necessary steps to comply with these laws and to ensure that the environment is protected for future generations.
