The court recently issued two orders in connection with petitions filed by B.G.R Mining and Infra Ltd seeking the release of vehicles seized by forest officers. The first order pertains to a vehicle seized in connection with an alleged offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that there was no evidence of any deliberate attempt by the petitioner to harm wildlife. The court cited a previous Supreme Court decision and directed the authority concerned to release the vehicle.

The second order pertains to a bus bearing registration number GJ-12BT-4834. The court allowed the petitioner's request to release the bus on certain conditions. The petitioner must provide a security bond of Rs. 5,00,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount, file an undertaking before the trial court, and produce the vehicle as and when directed by the trial court. The vehicle will be confiscated in the event of any subsequent offense. Necessary photographs and a detailed panchnama will be taken before handing over the vehicle to the petitioner, and videography may be done if necessary. The petitioner will bear the expenses for the photographs and videography.

In the first order, the court considered the petition filed by B.G.R Mining and Infra Ltd seeking the release of a vehicle seized by forest officers in connection with an alleged offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and noted that there was no evidence of any deliberate attempt by the petitioner to harm wildlife. The court cited a previous Supreme Court decision and directed the authority concerned to release the vehicle.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there was no evidence to suggest that the petitioner had intentionally harmed any wildlife. The court also noted that the petitioner had not been charged with any offense under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court cited a previous Supreme Court decision in which it was held that the seizure of a vehicle could not be justified if there was no evidence to suggest that the vehicle was being used for any illegal activity.

In the second order, the court allowed the petitioner's request to release their bus bearing registration number GJ-12BT-4834 on certain conditions. The petitioner was required to provide a security bond of Rs. 5,00,000 and a solvent surety of the same amount, file an undertaking before the trial court, and produce the vehicle as and when directed by the trial court. The court also directed that necessary photographs and a detailed panchnama be taken before handing over the vehicle to the petitioner, and videography may be done if necessary. The petitioner was required to bear the expenses for the photographs and videography.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had provided sufficient security to ensure that the vehicle would not be used for any illegal activity. The court also noted that the petitioner had agreed to produce the vehicle as and when directed by the trial court, which indicated their willingness to cooperate with the authorities. The court directed that the vehicle be confiscated in the event of any subsequent offense, which would serve as a deterrent to the petitioner from engaging in any illegal activity.

In conclusion, the court issued two orders in connection with petitions filed by B.G.R Mining and Infra Ltd seeking the release of vehicles seized by forest officers. In both cases, the court considered the evidence presented by both sides and made a decision based on the facts of the case. The court's decisions were based on the principle of ensuring that justice is served while also protecting the rights of the petitioner.
