The court order in question pertains to two applications related to the same crime. The applicants are currently in custody for an offense punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants' counsel argues that they are reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case is triable by the Court of JMFC. 

The court, after hearing the arguments put forth by the applicants' counsel, allows the applications and directs the release of the applicants on bail, subject to certain conditions. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it becomes ineffective. 

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an act of the Indian Parliament enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wildlife. 

The act has been amended several times since its enactment, with the latest amendment being in 2006. The act provides for the punishment of offenses related to the hunting, poaching, or killing of wild animals, birds, or plants. The act also provides for the punishment of offenses related to the trade or possession of wildlife or wildlife products. 

In the case at hand, the applicants are accused of an offense punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants' counsel argues that they are reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case is triable by the Court of JMFC. The Court of JMFC, or the Judicial Magistrate First Class, is a lower court in India that has the power to try offenses punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years. 

The court, after hearing the arguments put forth by the applicants' counsel, allows the applications and directs the release of the applicants on bail, subject to certain conditions. Bail is a legal process that allows an accused person to be released from custody while awaiting trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the accused person will appear in court for all hearings and will not commit any further offenses while on bail. 

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the applicants' criminal history, and the likelihood of the applicants fleeing from justice. The court has the discretion to grant or deny bail based on these factors. 

The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is subject to certain conditions. These conditions include the payment of a bail bond, the surrender of the applicants' passports, and the provision of a surety. A bail bond is a sum of money that is paid to the court as a guarantee that the accused person will appear in court for all hearings. A surety is a person who agrees to be responsible for the accused person's appearance in court. 

The court's order is effective until the end of the trial. This means that the applicants will remain on bail until the trial is concluded. However, if the applicants fail to appear in court for any hearing or commit any further offenses while on bail, the court's order becomes ineffective. In such a case, the applicants may be arrested and taken into custody. 

In conclusion, the court's order pertains to two applications related to the same crime. The applicants are in custody for an offense punishable under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allows the applications and directs the release of the applicants on bail, subject to certain conditions. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it becomes ineffective. The court's decision to grant bail to the applicants is based on several factors, including the nature of the offense, the applicants' criminal history, and the likelihood of the applicants fleeing from justice. The court's order is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of a bail bond, the surrender of the applicants' passports, and the provision of a surety.
