The first court order pertains to a case where a mining lease was granted prior to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 coming into force. The lessee discovered two additional minerals during mining operations and applied to include them in the lease. The State Government agreed and executed a Deed of Incorporation. However, the Divisional Forest Officer later stated that the lessee could not win the additional minerals without prior approval of the Central Government under the Act. The High Court allowed the writ petition filed by the lessee, holding that the Act did not apply to leases granted prior to its coming into force. The State of Bihar appealed the decision.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to check deforestation and to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act applies to all forest land, irrespective of whether it is owned by the government or private individuals.

The court held that the Act applies only to fresh breaking up or clearing of forest land after its coming into force and not to leases granted prior to it. The court also noted that the Act was passed to check deforestation and that breaking up of soil affects reafforestation and regeneration of forests. Therefore, the lessee was not required to obtain prior approval of the Central Government for winning the additional minerals.

The State of Bihar argued that the High Court erred in holding that the Act did not apply to leases granted prior to its coming into force. The State contended that the Act applies to all forest land, irrespective of when the lease was granted. The State also argued that the lessee was required to obtain prior approval of the Central Government for winning the additional minerals.

The court rejected the State's arguments and held that the Act applies only to fresh breaking up or clearing of forest land after its coming into force. The court also held that the lessee was not required to obtain prior approval of the Central Government for winning the additional minerals.

In the second court order, the court discusses the enforcement of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court determines that if forest land has already been broken up or cleared before the Act's commencement, permission for mining operations in that area does not require prior approval. The court allows the mining leaseholder to carry out operations on five acres of land, subject to conditions, and affirms the judgment of the High Court.

The court noted that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 was enacted to check deforestation and to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act requires prior approval from the Central Government for any use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The Act applies to all forest land, irrespective of whether it is owned by the government or private individuals.

The court held that if forest land has already been broken up or cleared before the Act's commencement, permission for mining operations in that area does not require prior approval. The court also held that the mining leaseholder was entitled to carry out operations on five acres of land, subject to conditions.

The court affirmed the judgment of the High Court, which had allowed the mining leaseholder to carry out operations on five acres of land, subject to conditions. The court noted that the High Court had taken into account the environmental impact of the mining operations and had imposed conditions to mitigate the same.

In conclusion, both court orders deal with the enforcement of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court held that the Act applies only to fresh breaking up or clearing of forest land after its coming into force and not to leases granted prior to it. The court also held that if forest land has already been broken up or cleared before the Act's commencement, permission for mining operations in that area does not require prior approval. The court allowed the mining leaseholder to carry out operations on five acres of land, subject to conditions, and affirmed the judgment of the High Court. The court's decisions were based on the need to check deforestation and to regulate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes.
