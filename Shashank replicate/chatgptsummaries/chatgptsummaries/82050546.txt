The Supreme Court of India recently dismissed an appeal filed by the State of Rajasthan against a High Court order that suspended the conviction of actor Salman Khan under the Wild Life (Protection Act), 1972. The High Court had allowed the suspension of the order of conviction, which was coming in the way of Khan's travel abroad for professional engagements. The State argued that the suspension of conviction only takes away the operative effect of conviction, but the conviction as a fact stands until reversion and acquittal. The Supreme Court considered the rival contentions raised by the parties and perused the record before dismissing the appeal.

The court order pertains to a case where an individual has been convicted of an offense and is seeking to travel abroad for work purposes. The court has set aside the previous judgment and remitted the case to the High Court to decide the matter afresh. The court has stated that the power to suspend conviction and sentence pending appeal/revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances where failure to stay the conviction would lead to injustice and irreversible consequences. The court has also noted that if the irreversible consequences/injustice caused by the conviction cannot be undone if the individual ultimately succeeds, then it may be within the court's domain to stay the conviction.

The case involving Salman Khan dates back to 1998 when he was accused of hunting two blackbucks in Rajasthan's Kankani village while shooting for the film 'Hum Saath Saath Hain.' The actor was charged under the Wild Life (Protection Act), 1972, and sentenced to five years in prison in 2018. However, the High Court suspended the conviction, allowing Khan to travel abroad for professional engagements.

The State of Rajasthan appealed against the High Court order, arguing that the suspension of conviction only takes away the operative effect of conviction, but the conviction as a fact stands until reversion and acquittal. The State contended that the High Court had erred in suspending the conviction, as the irreversible consequences/injustice caused by the conviction could be undone if Khan ultimately succeeds.

The Supreme Court considered the rival contentions raised by the parties and perused the record before dismissing the appeal. The court noted that the power to suspend conviction and sentence pending appeal/revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances where failure to stay the conviction would lead to injustice and irreversible consequences. The court also observed that if the irreversible consequences/injustice caused by the conviction cannot be undone if the individual ultimately succeeds, then it may be within the court's domain to stay the conviction.

The court order has significant implications for individuals who have been convicted of offenses and are seeking to travel abroad for work purposes. The court has clarified that the power to suspend conviction and sentence pending appeal/revision can only be exercised in exceptional circumstances where failure to stay the conviction would lead to injustice and irreversible consequences. The court has also emphasized that if the irreversible consequences/injustice caused by the conviction cannot be undone if the individual ultimately succeeds, then it may be within the court's domain to stay the conviction.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's dismissal of the State of Rajasthan's appeal against the High Court order that suspended the conviction of actor Salman Khan under the Wild Life (Protection Act), 1972, has significant implications for individuals who have been convicted of offenses and are seeking to travel abroad for work purposes.
