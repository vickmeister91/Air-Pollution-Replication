The court order pertains to a case where the accused-petitioner is facing prosecution for offences punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The prosecution filed a charge-sheet along with the sanction purported to have been granted by the Chief General Manager of State Bank of India. The accused-petitioner moved an application under Section 91 of the Code stating that the production of the report and file was necessary for the purpose of enquiry, trial and further cross-examination of the witness. The prosecution claimed privilege in respect of the said document under Sections 123 and 124 of the Evidence Act, 1872.

The learned trial Judge came to the conclusion that the document in question was not a privilege document but the production of the same was not warranted. The learned trial Judge further held that the examination of the sanctioning authority is not necessary and the order of sanction can be proved by other evidence. The accused-petitioner challenged the order, but the court held that an application under Section 91 of the Code is not tenable, and the learned trial Judge has rightly opined that it would be open to the defence to challenge the validity of the sanction.

The court order states that the defense can challenge the validity of the sanction and the judge's opinion on this matter is approved. The defense can challenge the sanction from all aspects and the judge will consider it at the appropriate stage. The applications made by the defense are dismissed as they are without merit.
