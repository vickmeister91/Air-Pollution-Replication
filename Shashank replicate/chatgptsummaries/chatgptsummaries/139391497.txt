The case in question involves the petitioner, who is one of the accused in a case under Sections 302/307/201 of the IPC read with Section 120-B IPC. The petitioner has invoked the inherent powers of the Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr.P.C.) for setting aside of the order dated 19.12.2007 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge ('ASJ') and seeks recalling of PW-1, PW-52, PW-114, PW-149, PW-168 and PW-170 examined by the prosecution and summoning of the seven persons as mentioned in the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C.

The petitioner's request to recall the earlier said witnesses and summon the seven persons under Section 311 Cr.P.C. was declined by the court. The court held that the order dated 19.12.2012 does not call for any interference under inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. The section is a residuary provision which saves the inherent powers of the High Court.

In the present case, the petitioner has invoked the inherent powers of the Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. for setting aside of the order dated 19.12.2007 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge ('ASJ') and seeks recalling of PW-1, PW-52, PW-114, PW-149, PW-168 and PW-170 examined by the prosecution and summoning of the seven persons as mentioned in the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C.

The court, however, declined the petitioner's request to recall the earlier said witnesses and summon the seven persons under Section 311 Cr.P.C. The court held that the order dated 19.12.2012 does not call for any interference under inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.

Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the power of the court to summon material witnesses, or examine any person present in court, or recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such summoning, examination, recall or re-examination is necessary for the just decision of the case.

In the present case, the petitioner sought the recalling of PW-1, PW-52, PW-114, PW-149, PW-168 and PW-170 examined by the prosecution and summoning of the seven persons as mentioned in the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. However, the court declined the petitioner's request.

The court held that the order dated 19.12.2012 does not call for any interference under inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The court further held that the petitioner has not been able to make out a case for recalling the witnesses and summoning the seven persons under Section 311 Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court declined the petitioner's request to recall the earlier said witnesses and summon the seven persons under Section 311 Cr.P.C. The court held that the order dated 19.12.2012 does not call for any interference under inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The court further held that the petitioner has not been able to make out a case for recalling the witnesses and summoning the seven persons under Section 311 Cr.P.C.
