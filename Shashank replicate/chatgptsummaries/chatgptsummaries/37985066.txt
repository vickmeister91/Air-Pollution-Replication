The Himachal Pradesh High Court issued an order on March 11, 2020, regarding several cases related to the jurisdiction of the court and the regulation of stone crushers in the state. The first case, CWP No. 2067 of 2019 and CWP No. 4342 of 2019, pertains to the jurisdiction of the Division Bench of the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India over the order passed by the National Green Tribunal and modification of the interim order passed in this matter by this Court on Aug 29, 2019. The Court cited a Supreme Court judgment in Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board vs. Sterlite Industries (I) Ltd. & others, 2019 (3) SCALE 721, to clarify the jurisdiction of High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution over the orders passed by the National Green Tribunal.

The second case discussed in the court order pertains to the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal in matters related to service and recruitment of members of All-India Services, civil services, defense services, and civilians appointed to government or government-controlled entities. The order also specifies that the NGT, a statutory tribunal, does not have the power of judicial review akin to that of a High Court exercising constitutional powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court order discusses two judgments by the Hon'ble Supreme Court regarding the jurisdiction and powers of High Courts under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court clarifies that the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 does not limit the powers of High Courts against military or armed forces disputes, but such powers must be exercised restrictively and on limited grounds. The court also emphasizes that the jurisdiction under Article 226 cannot be circumscribed by any enactment and must be zealously protected. The court suggests that direct appeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals should be revisited and appeals to Division Benches of High Courts should be provided instead.

The court order directs the Union to undertake an exercise to increase affordability of justice and provide High Court judges with adequate experience before coming to the Supreme Court. The court has jurisdiction to pass an interim order and modify it. The interim order in question prohibits the application of a prohibition of 100 meters to non-perennial rivulets. The court also discusses an impugned order related to the operation of stone crushers in Himachal Pradesh.

The court order discusses the regulation of stone crushers in the state of Himachal Pradesh. The State Pollution Control Board had directed a stone crusher unit to stop its operation due to violation of distance norms from a water body. However, consent to operate was later granted. The court refers to a notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 which prohibits the location of a stone crusher within 100 meters of springs, canals, reservoirs, or functional water supply schemes, including natural water springs. The court clarifies that this includes rivulets of perennial nature and cannot be read as excluding non-perennial water bodies. The court quashes the consent to operate granted to any stone crusher within 100 meters of a water body and orders the State Pollution Control Board to take steps to stop their operation. A review petition was filed by the state, but the court upheld its previous order.

The court order discusses the minimum distances that must be maintained between stone crushers and various water bodies, including springs, canals, reservoirs, and natural water schemes. The court also clarifies that the regulatory regime under the Notification applies to non-perennial water bodies as well. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has granted liberty to parties to move the Tribunal for a suitable modification of the order on the merits. The State of Himachal Pradesh and representative of Stone Crushers have requested that the distance of 100 meters from non-perennial rivulets should not be applied in the same manner as it is applied to perennial rivers or other water bodies mentioned in the Notification.

The court order discusses the regulation of the location of stone crushers near water bodies. The court rejected the argument that only perennial water bodies need to be protected and sought expert opinion on the matter. The expert committee recommended that the distance norm of 100 meters should be uniformly applied to all streams, and no mining/extraction activities should be carried out on first order non-perennial streams. The court refused to review or modify the earlier view that non-perennial water bodies are not covered by the prohibition of location of stone crushers within 100 meters.

The court order states that non-perennial water bodies are not covered by the prohibition of location of stone crushers within 100 meters of such bodies. The expert opinion suggests that restriction of distance for location of stone crushers should universally apply for 'perennial' as well as 'non-perennial' water bodies. The court cannot go into the issue of exemption in certain situations subject to conditions as they are not sure whether such conditions or their enforcement is environmentally viable at any particular location. The court also rejects the contention that the prohibition does not apply to the units already set up. The court dismisses the applications. The order also discusses the history of the controversy and the filing of petitions challenging the guidelines relating to stone crushing units.

The court order pertains to the recommendations made by a Joint Expert Committee regarding the location and operation of stone crusher units near streams. The committee recommends that a distance norm of 100 meters be applied uniformly to all streams, and that no mining/ex
