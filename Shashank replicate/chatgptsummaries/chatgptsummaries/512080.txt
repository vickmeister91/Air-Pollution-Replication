In 1946, a court order was issued in the case of Sheikh Mohammad vs Mt. Rukmina Kunwar and others. The case involved a suit for specific performance of an alleged contract of sale. The Civil Judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that it was not maintainable due to the Encumbered Estates Act. The plaintiffs appealed to the High Court, which remanded the case to the Civil Judge with the direction to stay the hearing of the suit until the decision of the Encumbered Estates Act case.

After the Encumbered Estates Act case was decided, the Civil Judge dismissed the suit for want of prosecution. However, the plaintiffs filed an application under Section 151, Civil P.C. requesting the Court to set aside the order and restore the suit to its original number. The application was opposed by the defendants, but the Court allowed the application and set aside the order of the Civil Judge, directing that the suit be restored to its original number.

The case involved a dispute over a contract of sale, which the plaintiffs alleged had been breached by the defendants. The plaintiffs had filed a suit for specific performance of the contract, seeking to compel the defendants to perform their obligations under the contract. However, the Civil Judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that it was not maintainable due to the Encumbered Estates Act.

The Encumbered Estates Act was a law that was enacted in British India in 1856. The law provided for the appointment of a special officer, known as the Encumbered Estates Court, to take over the management of estates that were burdened with debt. The law was intended to provide relief to landowners who were unable to pay their debts, by allowing them to surrender their estates to the Court, which would then sell the estates and distribute the proceeds among the creditors.

In the present case, the defendants had argued that the suit was not maintainable under the Encumbered Estates Act, as the property in question had been surrendered to the Encumbered Estates Court. The Civil Judge had accepted this argument and dismissed the suit.

However, the plaintiffs had appealed to the High Court, arguing that the suit was maintainable, as the property had not been sold by the Encumbered Estates Court. The High Court had agreed with the plaintiffs and remanded the case to the Civil Judge with the direction to stay the hearing of the suit until the decision of the Encumbered Estates Act case.

After the Encumbered Estates Act case was decided, the Civil Judge had dismissed the suit for want of prosecution. However, the plaintiffs had filed an application under Section 151, Civil P.C. requesting the Court to set aside the order and restore the suit to its original number.

Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code empowers the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court. The plaintiffs had argued that the dismissal of the suit for want of prosecution was not justified, as they had been waiting for the decision of the Encumbered Estates Act case.

The defendants had opposed the application, arguing that the plaintiffs had not shown sufficient cause for the restoration of the suit. However, the Court had allowed the application and set aside the order of the Civil Judge, directing that the suit be restored to its original number.

In conclusion, the court order in the case of Sheikh Mohammad vs Mt. Rukmina Kunwar and others involved a dispute over a contract of sale, which the plaintiffs alleged had been breached by the defendants. The case was dismissed by the Civil Judge on the grounds that it was not maintainable due to the Encumbered Estates Act. However, the High Court had remanded the case to the Civil Judge with the direction to stay the hearing of the suit until the decision of the Encumbered Estates Act case. After the Encumbered Estates Act case was decided, the Civil Judge had dismissed the suit for want of prosecution. The plaintiffs had filed an application under Section 151, Civil P.C. requesting the Court to set aside the order and restore the suit to its original number. The Court had allowed the application and set aside the order of the Civil Judge, directing that the suit be restored to its original number.
