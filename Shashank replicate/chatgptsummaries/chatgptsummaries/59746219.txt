The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C) to set aside an order passed by the J.M.F.C (Judicial Magistrate First Class), Bhopal in a criminal complaint case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C to call the Income Tax Return of the complainant for the year 2011-2015 for verification of the same, which was dismissed by the J.M.F.C. 

The petitioner, in this case, was accused of issuing a cheque that was dishonored by the bank. The complainant, who was the recipient of the cheque, filed a criminal complaint against the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner, in turn, filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C to call the Income Tax Return of the complainant for the year 2011-2015 for verification of the same. The J.M.F.C dismissed the application, which led to the petitioner filing a petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C to set aside the order.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, allowed the petition subject to the condition that the income tax return of the complainant for the year 2014-2015 be called at the expenses of the petitioner/accused. The court held that the Income Tax Return of the complainant for the year 2014-2015 was relevant to the case and could be called for verification. However, the court dismissed the petition regarding the "draft of the sale deed" alleged to have been signed and taken by the petitioner/accused.

The court's decision to allow the petition subject to the condition that the income tax return of the complainant for the year 2014-2015 be called at the expenses of the petitioner/accused is significant. It shows that the court is willing to consider relevant evidence in a case, even if it means calling for the Income Tax Return of the complainant. This decision also highlights the importance of providing evidence in a case and the role it plays in determining the outcome.

However, the court's decision to dismiss the petition regarding the "draft of the sale deed" alleged to have been signed and taken by the petitioner/accused is also noteworthy. This decision shows that the court is not willing to consider evidence that is not relevant to the case. It also emphasizes the importance of presenting relevant evidence in a case and not wasting the court's time with irrelevant evidence.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case highlights the importance of providing relevant evidence in a case. It also shows that the court is willing to consider evidence that is relevant to the case, even if it means calling for the Income Tax Return of the complainant. However, the court is not willing to consider evidence that is not relevant to the case and emphasizes the importance of presenting relevant evidence in a case.
