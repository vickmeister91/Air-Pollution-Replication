The National Green Tribunal recently dismissed an appeal made by M/S P. Manokaran Power Loom and others against an order made under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981. The order directed the closure of their unit and the stoppage of electricity supply for certain violations. The tribunal held that the appeal was not maintainable as an appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act was available, and the petitioners had approached the High Court of Madras under Article 226 of the Constitution of India instead.

The tribunal also clarified that the petitioners could file an appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act and seek condonation of delay in filing the appeal. This decision by the tribunal highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures when filing appeals and seeking redressal for grievances.

The case in question involved violations of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 by M/S P. Manokaran Power Loom and others.

The petitioners, however, chose to approach the High Court of Madras under Article 226 of the Constitution of India instead of filing an appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act.

The National Green Tribunal, in its decision, pointed out that the petitioners had not followed the correct legal procedure. The tribunal held that an appeal under Section 31 of the Air Act was available to the petitioners, and they should have filed the appeal instead of approaching the High Court of Madras under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

This means that the petitioners still have a chance to seek redressal for their grievances, but they must follow the correct legal procedure.

The decision by the National Green Tribunal highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures when seeking redressal for grievances. It also emphasizes the need for individuals and organizations to be aware of the various legal options available to them and to choose the appropriate option based on their specific circumstances.

In conclusion, the National Green Tribunal's decision to dismiss the appeal made by M/S P. Manokaran Power Loom and others against an order made under Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1981 serves as a reminder to individuals and organizations to follow the correct legal procedures when seeking redressal for grievances.
