The court has granted bail to Soma Ram, who was arrested and lodged in judicial custody for an offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner's counsel argued that the co-accused had already been granted bail, and the case of the petitioner was not distinguishable from him. The court allowed the bail application and ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs. 25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trade in wildlife, and the conservation of endangered species. The Act also provides for penalties for offences related to wildlife, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Soma Ram was arrested and lodged in judicial custody for an offence under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The specific offence that he was charged with is not mentioned in the court order, but it is likely that it was related to hunting or trade in wildlife. The fact that he was granted bail suggests that the offence was not very serious, or that there were mitigating circumstances that warranted his release.

The petitioner's counsel argued that the co-accused had already been granted bail, and that the case of the petitioner was not distinguishable from him. This argument is based on the principle of parity, which holds that similarly situated individuals should be treated similarly by the law. If the co-accused had been granted bail, then it would be unfair to deny bail to Soma Ram on the same charges.

The court agreed with the petitioner's counsel and allowed the bail application. The court ordered the accused to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/- with two surety bonds of Rs. 25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This means that Soma Ram will have to provide a guarantee of Rs. 50,000/- that he will appear in court when required, and that two other individuals will have to provide guarantees of Rs. 25,000/- each that they will ensure his appearance in court. If Soma Ram fails to appear in court, then the bond amount will be forfeited.

The court's decision to grant bail to Soma Ram is significant because it shows that the court is willing to consider the principle of parity in its decisions. This is important because it ensures that similarly situated individuals are treated similarly by the law, and that there is no discrimination or bias in the legal system. The court's decision also shows that it is willing to consider mitigating circumstances in its decisions, which is important because it ensures that the punishment fits the crime.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Soma Ram is a positive development in the legal system. It shows that the court is willing to consider the principle of parity and mitigating circumstances in its decisions, which is important for ensuring fairness and justice in the legal system. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats, and it is important that the law is enforced in a fair and just manner.
