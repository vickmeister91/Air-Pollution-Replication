The Indian courts have recently issued two orders related to environmental clearances and ecologically sensitive areas (ESA). The first case involved several individuals engaged in stone quarrying and crushing operations who held quarrying leases/permits issued by statutory authorities. The petitioners had approached Environment Impact Assessment Authorities for Environmental Clearance certificates, but their applications were not processed due to ambiguity regarding whether the proposed operations fell within ESA as notified by the Central Government. The petitioners sought direction to process their applications for Environmental Clearance, treating their projects as falling under non-ESA category. The court heard counter-affidavits and considered exhibits submitted by both parties.

In this case, the court directed the Environment Impact Assessment Authorities to consider the applications for environmental clearance submitted by the petitioners, who are carrying out quarrying operations, by treating the area where they are operating as not falling under the ambit of ESA for the purposes of the draft notification. The court also clarified that the starting point of limitation for the purposes of the deeming provisions under the 2006 Notification will commence from the date of production of a copy of this judgment before the said authorities.

The second case pertains to the identification of ecologically sensitive areas (ESA) in the state of Kerala, India. The draft notification issued by the Central Government in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change identified an area of 56,825 Sq.km spread across six states as the Western Ghats ecologically sensitive area. The court directed the Environment Impact Assessment Authorities to consider the applications for environmental clearance submitted by the petitioners, who are carrying out quarrying operations, by treating the area where they are operating as not falling under the ambit of ESA for the purposes of the draft notification.

The court's decision in both cases is significant as it clarifies the ambiguity surrounding the identification of ESA and provides relief to the petitioners who were unable to obtain environmental clearances due to the confusion. The court's decision also highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision in the first case is particularly noteworthy as it clarifies the starting point of limitation for the purposes of the deeming provisions under the 2006 Notification. This provision states that if an application for environmental clearance is not processed within a certain period, it will be deemed to have been granted. The court's decision clarifies that the starting point of limitation will commence from the date of production of a copy of the judgment before the authorities.

Overall, the court's decisions in both cases provide clarity and relief to the petitioners who were unable to obtain environmental clearances due to the ambiguity surrounding the identification of ESA. The decisions also highlight the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection and the need for clear and consistent regulations to achieve this balance.
