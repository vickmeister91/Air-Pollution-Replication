In a recent court order, Prashanthakumar filed a criminal petition seeking anticipatory bail in the event of his arrest for alleged offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Explosive Act. The court heard arguments from both sides and found that the allegations against Prashanthakumar were not supported by sufficient evidence. As a result, the court granted him anticipatory bail subject to certain conditions.

The court's decision was based on a thorough examination of the evidence presented by both parties. The prosecution argued that Prashanthakumar had violated the Wild Life Protection Act and Explosive Act by possessing and using explosives to hunt wild animals. However, the defence argued that there was no evidence to support these allegations and that Prashanthakumar was being falsely accused.

After considering both sides of the argument, the court found that the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their allegations. The court noted that there was no direct evidence linking Prashanthakumar to the alleged offences and that the prosecution had relied on circumstantial evidence to make their case.

In light of this, the court granted Prashanthakumar anticipatory bail subject to certain conditions. These conditions included executing a personal bond and not tampering with prosecution witnesses. The court also noted that if Prashanthakumar were to violate any of these conditions, his bail could be revoked.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of presenting strong evidence in criminal cases. Without sufficient evidence to support their allegations, the prosecution's case is unlikely to succeed. In this case, the court found that the allegations against Prashanthakumar were not supported by sufficient evidence and granted him anticipatory bail as a result.
