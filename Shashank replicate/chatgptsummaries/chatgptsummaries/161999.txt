The court orders discussed in this summary cover a wide range of topics, including the appointment of an Advocate General, the evolution and importance of public interest litigation (PIL), the protection and preservation of the environment, and the misuse of PIL. 

In one case, the State of Uttaranchal filed appeals against the orders of the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital in a PIL challenging the appointment of L.P. Nathani as Advocate General. The High Court directed the State Government to take a decision on the issue raised within 15 days and apprise the same to the High Court. The Supreme Court stayed the operation of the impugned judgment of the High Court and granted leave. The Division Bench of the High Court observed that the Governor shall appoint a person as the Advocate General who is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of a High Court. 

In another case, the court discussed a controversy regarding the appointment of an Advocate General and whether the age of retirement for a Judge of a High Court applies to the Advocate General. The court concluded that the age of retirement does not apply to the Advocate General as there is a specific provision in the Constitution about the duration of the Advocate General's appointment. The court also noted that this controversy has been settled by a previous judgment and that filing indiscriminate petitions with the same relief creates unnecessary strain on the judicial system. 

The court also discussed various cases where the appointment of advocates and other authorities was challenged on the grounds of age limit. The court held that the age of superannuation of a High Court Judge does not apply to the post of Advocate General. The appointment of the Attorney General for India can be made after the age of 65 years. The court also emphasized that the controversy once settled by an authoritative judgment should not be reopened unless there are extraordinary reasons for doing so. The court criticized the abuse of the judicial process and the filing of repeated petitions in various courts.

In another case, a petitioner filed a writ petition in public interest under Article 226 of the Constitution, challenging the appointment of an Advocate General in the State of Uttarakhand who was over 62 years of age. The court found that this was an abuse of process and a waste of the court's time, as the same controversy had been repeatedly raised in various High Courts. The court then went on to define PIL and examine its origins and importance in providing access to justice for marginalized sections of society. The court also discussed the evolution of PIL in various countries and the need to prevent its abuse.

The court noted that PIL is not in the nature of adversary litigation, but rather a challenge and opportunity for the government to ensure social and economic justice for all. The court also discussed the three phases of PIL, including cases related to fundamental rights, protection of the environment, and maintaining probity and transparency in governance. The court also addressed the abuse of PIL and proposed remedial measures to prevent its misuse. The order cited several important cases related to the relaxation of the traditional rule of locus standi and the importance of public-oriented litigation in fulfilling the rule of law.

The court also discussed various cases where the traditional rule of locus standi (the right to bring a legal action) was relaxed to allow for public interest litigation. The court emphasized the importance of access to justice for all, especially the poor and disadvantaged, and noted that procedural rules should not be used to deny justice. The court also highlighted the role of public interest litigation in promoting and vindicating public interest and protecting constitutional and legal rights. The court ultimately concluded that the traditional rule of standing is obsolete and should be replaced with a modern rule that allows for legal action when a legal wrong or injury is caused to a person or class of persons, or when an illegal burden is imposed.

The court also passed numerous orders and directions to ensure the protection and preservation of the environment, ecology, and wildlife. One example is the conversion of public transport in Delhi from diesel to CNG engines to reduce pollution. The court has intervened in cases of air and water pollution, environmental degradation, and hazardous work conditions. The court has also established the polluter pays principle and declared certain articles of the constitution as part of the mandate to protect and improve the environment. The court has ordered industries to ban the use of coke/coal and shift to CNG or relocate to protect the Taj Mahal from sulfur dioxide emissions.

The court emphasized the importance of meeting public interest, environmental protection, elimination of pollution, and sustainable development. The court also stressed the need for balance between economic development and environmental protection, citing principles from the Stockholm Declaration. The court upholds the principle of Polluter-pays, stating that those who cause pollution must pay for damages or compensation for restoration of the environment and ecology. The court also gives comprehensive directions to reduce air pollution and noise pollution. The court emphasizes the need for development and environment to go hand in hand, without development at the cost of the environment or vice versa. The court also passes significant directions to protect ecologically fragile coastal areas and deal with the situation created by the shrimp culture industry in coastal states.

The court also discussed the evolution of standing rules in England and South Africa for public interest litigation. In England, the judiciary was initially hesitant to grant standing to individuals seeking remedy through relator claims, but an amendment to the Rules of the Supreme Court in 1978 overcame this hesitation. In South Africa, Section 38 of the Constitution broadly grants standing to approach a
