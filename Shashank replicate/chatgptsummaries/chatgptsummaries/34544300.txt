In a recent court order, Raju Rajak, who was accused of illegally killing an endangered mouse deer with his licensed gun, was granted bail. The court found that the applicant had been in custody since the incident and that the carcass of the mouse deer had not been recovered by the police, indicating that the applicant was implicated on mere suspicion.

The court ordered the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs.20,000 and a solvent surety in the same amount to ensure his appearance in court. The applicant was also required to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437 (3) of the Cr.P.C.

The decision to grant bail to Raju Rajak was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found that the applicant had been in custody since the incident, which indicated that he was not a flight risk. Secondly, the fact that the carcass of the mouse deer had not been recovered by the police suggested that the applicant was implicated on mere suspicion, rather than concrete evidence.

In addition to the personal bond and solvent surety, the court also required the applicant to abide by the conditions enumerated in Section 437 (3) of the Cr.P.C. These conditions include appearing before the court as and when required, refraining from committing any offence while on bail, and not tampering with evidence or witnesses.

The decision to grant bail to Raju Rajak has been met with mixed reactions. Some have argued that the decision was justified, given the lack of concrete evidence against the applicant. Others, however, have expressed concern that the decision could set a dangerous precedent, as it may encourage others to engage in illegal hunting and poaching.

It is worth noting that the killing of endangered species is a serious offence under Indian law. The Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and imposes strict penalties for offences such as hunting, poaching, and trafficking of wildlife.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Raju Rajak, who was accused of illegally killing an endangered mouse deer with his licensed gun, was based on several factors, including the lack of concrete evidence against the applicant. While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, it is important to remember that the killing of endangered species is a serious offence under Indian law, and that strict penalties are in place to deter such activities.
