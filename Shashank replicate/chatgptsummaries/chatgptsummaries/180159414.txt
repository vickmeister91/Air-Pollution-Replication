The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s Sindh Plastic & Anr for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The accused argued that the complaint was not maintainable as the DPCC had no authority to file it. The complainant argued that the complaint was filed by an authorized officer in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board and with the prior approval of the Member Secretary. The court considered the arguments and relevant provisions of the law and concluded that the complaint was maintainable. The court also referred to previous judgments and relevant provisions of the law to support its decision.

The court order states that no offense under the Act can be taken cognizance of unless a complaint is made by the Central Government, an authorized authority or officer, or a person who has given notice of the alleged offense and their intention to make a complaint. The order also explains that the provisions of the Act and its rules will have effect despite anything inconsistent in any other enactment, except when an act or omission constitutes an offense punishable under both this Act and another Act, in which case the offender will be punished under the other Act. The order cites two relevant court decisions, one interpreting Section 20(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and the other discussing the delegation of powers under Section 69(1) of the Act.

The court order discusses the delegation of powers, duties, and functions conferred upon the Commissioner or Transport Manager under the Act to a municipal officer. The court clarifies that only the authorities mentioned in the Act can launch proceedings against persons charged with offenses under the Act or the rules, regulations, or bye-laws made under it. The court also emphasizes that an officer of the municipality must perform their duties created by statute or bye-law and cannot delegate them to others unless expressly authorized. The court concludes that the complaint under the EP Act cannot be filed by any person who is not authorized specifically under the Act or by notification.

The court order states that for a complainant to request a magistrate to take cognizance of an offense, they must satisfy the eligibility criteria prescribed by the statute. In this case, the present complaint was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act. The DPCC exceeded their power by passing a resolution to sub-delegate their power to file a complaint to the area AEE, and no steps were taken to remove the defect in filing the complaint. The court held that the present complaint is not maintainable, and since the complaint itself is not maintainable, no charge can be framed. The accused stands discharged, and the bail bond and surety are cancelled.

In summary, the court orders discussed the maintainability of complaints filed under the Environmental Protection Act (EP Act). The first order dealt with a complaint filed by the DPCC against M/s Sindh Plastic & Anr for violating a notification on the use, sale, and storage of plastic bags. The court concluded that the complaint was maintainable as it was filed by an authorized officer in accordance with the authority conferred upon him by the DPCC Board and with the prior approval of the Member Secretary.

The second order clarified that no offense under the Act can be taken cognizance of unless a complaint is made by the Central Government, an authorized authority or officer, or a person who has given notice of the alleged offense and their intention to make a complaint. The order also explained that the provisions of the Act and its rules will have effect despite anything inconsistent in any other enactment, except when an act or omission constitutes an offense punishable under both this Act and another Act, in which case the offender will be punished under the other Act.

The third order discussed the delegation of powers, duties, and functions conferred upon the Commissioner or Transport Manager under the Act to a municipal officer. The court clarified that only the authorities mentioned in the Act can launch proceedings against persons charged with offenses under the Act or the rules, regulations, or bye-laws made under it. The court also emphasized that an officer of the municipality must perform their duties created by statute or bye-law and cannot delegate them to others unless expressly authorized.

The fourth order dealt with a complaint filed by the DPCC against an accused who argued that the complaint was not maintainable as it was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act. The court held that the present complaint was not maintainable as it was not filed by a person authorized under the EP Act, and since the complaint itself was not maintainable, no charge could be framed. The accused stood discharged, and the bail bond and surety were cancelled.

In conclusion, the court orders emphasized the importance of filing complaints under the EP Act by authorized authorities or officers and clarified the delegation of powers, duties, and functions under the Act.
