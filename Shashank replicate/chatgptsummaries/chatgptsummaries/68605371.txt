The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various cases involving the admissibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods, inputs, and input services. In the first case, M/S J.K.Paper Mills filed an appeal against an order passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise, Customs & Service Tax, Bhubaneswar-I. The appeal concerns the Appellant's alleged contravention of Rules 3(5B), 2(a)(A) and 3(5) of the Central Credit Rules, 2004, and the confirmation of a demand and imposition of equivalent penalty on the Appellant under Rule 15 of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AC of the Central Excise Act, 1944.

The Appellant challenges the impugned Order on the grounds that it has gone beyond the scope of the show cause notice, and that Rule 3(5) of the CCR, 2004, on the basis of which the demand has been confirmed, is not applicable to the facts of the present case. The Appellant also argues that credit cannot be denied on the ground that the capital goods are sold and owned by another company, and that physical removal of the capital goods from the factory of the Appellant is necessary to bring them under the fold of Rule 3(5) of CCR, 2004.

In the second case, Areni Collieries Co. Ltd. and Vemuganti Ramakrishnan Rao & Others were involved in a dispute over whether the appellant is entitled to avail/retain the CENVAT credit in their books and utilize it towards payment of duty on their finished products or otherwise, after selling capital goods to M/s JKETL. The appellant argues that ownership is not relevant to the eligibility of CENVAT Credit on inputs/capital goods under the CENVAT Credit Rules,2004. However, the court finds that the circumstances in the present case are different, and the principle of law laid down in previous cases is not applicable. The court also discusses the criterion of removal of capital goods and refers to the judgment of the Honble Supreme Court in J.K.Spinning and Weaving Mills case to understand the meaning of removal.

In the third case, the court order states that capital equipment and machinery cannot be recovered from the appellant. The meaning of the word "removal" in excise provisions is discussed, and it is concluded that it should be understood in the context in which it is used. The court cites previous cases to support this conclusion. The court also refers to a case where a company sold a power unit and leased the premises to the purchaser, and it was considered to be physical removal of the unit. The court applies this principle to the present case, where the appellant sold a lime kiln plant and the lime manufactured by another company was supplied to the appellant. The appellant argued that the tests laid down in the previous case were not satisfied in the present case, but the court found that the land was given on lease and there was no finding in the impugned order on the control of the plant.

In the fourth case, the court order discusses a case involving the admissibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods, inputs, and input services. The court finds that the principle laid down in Associated Cements case is applicable to the present case, and once the ownership and control of the equipment and machinery are transferred to another legal entity, even if it is situated in the same factory premises, it would be construed as removal within the meaning of Rule 3(4) of the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, and CENVAT Credit on the capital goods availed by the transferor is liable to be recovered. The case is remanded to the Ld. Commissioner for ascertaining the facts and applying the ratio of Associated Cements case. The court also finds that penalty under Rule 15 of CCR,2004 read with Sec.11AC is not imposable on the Appellant.

In summary, these court orders deal with the admissibility of CENVAT credit on capital goods, inputs, and input services. The courts have discussed the meaning of "removal" in excise provisions and have referred to previous cases to support their conclusions. The courts have also considered the ownership and control of equipment and machinery when determining the eligibility of CENVAT credit. In some cases, the courts have remanded the case to the Commissioner for further investigation and application of relevant case law.
