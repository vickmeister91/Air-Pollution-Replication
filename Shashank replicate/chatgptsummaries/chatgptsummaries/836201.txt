The Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of an industry for not complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the High Court quashed the order, stating that the Board did not have the authority to issue such an order without first determining if the plant was emitting air pollutants. As no such finding was made, the Board's exercise of power was without jurisdiction and authority. The appeal was dismissed.

The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, is a legislation enacted by the Indian Parliament to provide for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the Central and State Pollution Control Boards to take measures to prevent and control air pollution. The Pollution Control Board is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act and ensuring compliance by industries and other sources of air pollution.

In a recent case, the Pollution Control Board had ordered the closure of an industry for not complying with the provisions of the Act. The Board had alleged that the industry was emitting air pollutants in violation of the Act and had issued a closure order under Section 31A of the Act. The industry had challenged the order before the High Court, which had quashed the order on the ground that the Board did not have the authority to issue such an order without first determining if the plant was emitting air pollutants.

The High Court had observed that the Board's power to issue a closure order under Section 31A of the Act was subject to the condition that the Board had to first determine if the plant was emitting air pollutants. The Court had noted that the Board had not made any such finding in the present case and had issued the closure order without any basis. The Court had held that the Board's exercise of power was without jurisdiction and authority and had quashed the closure order.

The industry had appealed against the High Court's order before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had dismissed the appeal and upheld the High Court's order. The Court had observed that the Board's power to issue a closure order was not absolute and was subject to the condition that the Board had to first determine if the plant was emitting air pollutants. The Court had noted that the Board had not made any such finding in the present case and had issued the closure order without any basis. The Court had held that the Board's exercise of power was without jurisdiction and authority and had quashed the closure order.

The Court's decision in this case is significant as it clarifies the scope of the Board's power to issue closure orders under the Act. The Court has held that the Board cannot issue a closure order without first determining if the plant is emitting air pollutants. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on the enforcement of the Act and the compliance of industries with its provisions.

In conclusion, the recent decision of the Supreme Court in this case has clarified the scope of the Pollution Control Board's power to issue closure orders under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The Court has held that the Board cannot issue a closure order without first determining if the plant is emitting air pollutants. This decision is likely to have a significant impact on the enforcement of the Act and the compliance of industries with its provisions.
