The Act aimed to ensure that these establishments provide quality healthcare services to the public. However, the Ashirbad Nursing Home filed a writ petition challenging the Orissa Clinical Establishments (Control and Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2006, claiming that they were ultra vires the Act and frustrated the purpose of establishing nursing homes and clinical establishments.

The court order addressed several questions related to the registration and renewal of clinical establishments and nursing homes. The court found that the Rules, 2006 were not contrary to the provisions of the Act, 1990 and were valid. The court also addressed the fee structure for registration and renewal, including whether the period of registration is valid for one or two years, whether charging separate fees for different types of establishments is discriminatory, and whether the fee structure is reasonable.

The fees for registration and renewal vary based on the number of medical facilities and beds provided. The court also upheld the requirement for obtaining clearance from the Orissa State Pollution Control Board for disposal of biomedical waste.

The court dismissed the claim of unequal treatment and justified the charging of 10% for delayed registration.
