The court order pertains to a case where M/s Villa Paradiso challenged a notice issued by the H.P. State Pollution Control Board. The notice was issued in response to the construction carried out by the petitioner beyond the sanctioned plan and beyond the compoundable limits stipulated under the provisions of the H.P. Municipal Act, 1994 and Town and Country Planning Act, 1977. The court directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable as per the existing Municipal laws, and the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable. The court also directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

The court noted that several petitions of similar nature were filed and tagged together, all of which had violations of municipal laws and construction raised in excess of the sanctioned plans. The court dismissed the writ petition as the issue raised is no longer res integra and permits the petitioner to withdraw the petition subject to depositing a sum of Rs. 2.00 lac as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. All interim orders stand vacated.
