In a recent court order, a bail application filed by Chain Singh alias Raju under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. was dismissed as withdrawn. The applicants had been arrested in connection with a wildlife crime, and their counsel sought permission to withdraw the application with liberty to revive the prayer after the charge-sheet is filed.

The court granted the permission and dismissed the bail application as withdrawn. This means that the applicants will not be released on bail at this time, but they may be able to file another bail application in the future.

The decision to dismiss the bail application was likely based on the nature of the crime and the evidence against the applicants. Wildlife crimes are taken very seriously in India, and those who are accused of such crimes may face significant penalties if convicted.

It is also possible that the court considered the applicants to be flight risks or a danger to society, which would have made it more difficult for them to obtain bail.

Overall, the court's decision to dismiss the bail application as withdrawn is a reminder of the seriousness of wildlife crimes and the challenges that defendants may face in obtaining bail in such cases.
