The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ petition that challenged a consent letter issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court stated that the petitioners have the right to appeal under Section 28 of the Water Act and disposed of the writ petition, leaving it open for the petitioners to pursue appellate remedies. The court also declined to issue a direction requiring the first respondent to consider a non-statutory representation.

The case involved a dispute between the petitioners and the Kerala State Pollution Control Board over the issuance of a consent letter for the operation of a plant. The petitioners argued that the consent letter was issued without proper consideration of the environmental impact of the plant and that the Board had not followed the proper procedures for issuing the consent letter. The petitioners also argued that the Board had not considered their non-statutory representation before issuing the consent letter.

The court, however, found that the petitioners had not exhausted their appellate remedies under Section 28 of the Water Act. The court noted that Section 28 provides for an appeal to the National Green Tribunal against an order of the State Pollution Control Board. The court also noted that the petitioners had not filed an appeal under Section 28 and that they were free to pursue their appellate remedies.

The court also declined to issue a direction requiring the first respondent to consider the non-statutory representation of the petitioners. The court noted that the representation was not a statutory requirement and that the Board had already considered the representation before issuing the consent letter. The court also noted that the Board had followed the proper procedures for issuing the consent letter and that there was no evidence to suggest that the Board had acted improperly.

Overall, the court's decision highlights the importance of following proper procedures and exhausting appellate remedies in environmental disputes. The court's decision also underscores the limited role of non-statutory representations in environmental decision-making and the importance of complying with statutory requirements.
