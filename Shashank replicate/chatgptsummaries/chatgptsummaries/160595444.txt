The Kerala High Court recently heard several writ petitions related to the functioning of two rubber factories in Kottayam Municipality. The factories had been operating with licenses issued by the Kumaranalloor Grama Panchayat, which later merged with the municipality. The Panchayat had cancelled the licenses, but the factories continued to operate with requisite consents and permits from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board and the Factories and Boilers department. The court did not make a decision on the legality of the factories' operation at this stage.

The court order pertains to the production of a No Objection Certificate from nearby residents in relation to the renewal of an existing license. The court states that the pollution aspects must be considered regardless of the production of the certificate. The court also notes that the licenses were cancelled without affording the petitioners an opportunity to be heard and that the cancellation is liable to be reconsidered. The court directs the second respondent to consider the objections raised by the petitioners and all other parties concerned and to afford them an opportunity to be heard before making a decision. The court orders an expeditious decision within two weeks.
