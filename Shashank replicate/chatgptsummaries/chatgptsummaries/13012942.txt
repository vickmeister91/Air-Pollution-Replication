The court order pertains to a civil writ jurisdiction case filed by Fulena Construction Pvt. Ltd. against The East Central Railway and others. The petitioner sought to quash a letter rescinding their contract and attaching risks and costs to a fresh tender notice. The petitioner claimed that they were instructed to stop work due to lack of clearance from the Forest Department of the State, and despite several reminders to the respondents, they did not receive any guidance. The petitioner also protested against the illegal deduction of royalty. 

The court found that the risks and costs clause could only be invoked within six months after the expiry of the original period of completion of the contract and that the impugned action of carrying out the risks and costs clause could not sustain in the eyes of the law. The court held that the petitioner had not been given a reasonable opportunity to complete the work and that the Railways had not provided any evidence to show that the petitioner had failed to perform their contractual obligations. The court also found that the petitioner had not been given any notice before the contract was rescinded, and therefore, the rescission was illegal.

The court order discusses a case where a petitioner claimed that the Railways' invocation of the risks and costs clause was illegal and violated their fundamental and legal rights. The petitioner argued that the contract was frustrated due to non-performance of obligations by the Railways. However, the court found that the Railways had given sufficient indulgence to the petitioner to perform their contractual obligation and that there was no circumstance that could have frustrated the contract. The Railways had also been overindulgent with the petitioner, extending the contract multiple times. Ultimately, the court found that the writ petition had become infructuous and no effective relief could be granted to the petitioner.

The court order states that the petitioner was granted a tender in 2006 but failed to complete the work despite several extensions given to him. The subsequent tenderer completed the same work in the same set of circumstances. The Railways suffered a substantial loss of public money due to the petitioner's non-performance of the work. The contract was rescinded in terms of Clause 62 of the GCC, and the risk and cost clause was imposed on the petitioner, making him liable to payment thereof. The court found no merit in the writ application and upheld the impugned order dated 30.03.2011.
