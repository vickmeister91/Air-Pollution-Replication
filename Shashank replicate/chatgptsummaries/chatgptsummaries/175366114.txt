The court order pertains to a public interest litigation filed by Zoru Darayus Bhathena against the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation and other government bodies regarding the establishment of a casting yard at Juhu Koliwada for the construction of a sea-link from Bandra to Versova. The petitioner questions the establishment of the yard despite it being recorded as temporary and restricted to CRZ-II areas. The court heard arguments regarding the CRZ Notification and its regulations on prohibited activities and permissible building activities in CRZ-II. The court ultimately upheld the establishment of the casting yard but with certain conditions and restrictions.

The court order discusses the interpretation of regulations regarding construction activities in Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ). Regulation 3 prohibits certain activities in CRZ, including land reclamation and construction in CRZ-I, except for those specified in Regulation 8. The court considers the definition of "building" and the permissible activities under the Notification. The court also cites relevant portions of the CRZ Notification-2011. Regulation 7 classifies CRZ into four categories. The court order ultimately addresses the rival contentions and provides a decision on the matter.

The court order discusses the classification of Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) into four categories and the norms for regulating activities permissible under the Notification. The order emphasizes the need to balance conservation and protection of coastal stretches with construction and development. The order also highlights the prohibited activities in all four zones of CRZ, including the setting up of new industries and land reclamation.

The court order discusses the regulations regarding land reclamation, bunding, and construction activities in CRZ-I and CRZ-II areas. The court notes that while Regulation 8 permits building in CRZ-II, it is only on the landward side of existing roads or structures. The court also notes that the establishment of a casting yard involves activities that are akin to building, and the footprints left by the yard after the machinery is removed would have a permanent and lasting impact on the coastal stretch. The court concludes that the establishment of the casting yard violates the regulations and must be stopped.

The court order declares the permission to establish a casting yard as illegal and quashes the permission granted by MCZMA on February 26, 2019. The Public Interest Petition succeeds and there are no costs.
