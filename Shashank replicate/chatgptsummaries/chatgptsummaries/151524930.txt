The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to public interest litigations (PILs) filed by individuals seeking to address various issues. The first order pertains to a writ petition filed by M. Venkatesa Perumal, who sought a Writ of Mandamus to direct the District Collector of Chennai to consider a representation to realign a pipeline route from Madhavaram leather facility to Kondungaiyur Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) through Madhavaram High Road and through the bank of flood water drain canal from Moolakkadai to Kodungaiyur STP to be executed by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. The petitioner argued that the proposed pipeline would pass through highly populated residential areas, consisting of residential houses and flats, commercial establishments, and schools, and would cause hardship to the public. The second respondent, Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, argued that the proposed pipeline was necessary to meet TNPCB norms regarding TDS by Madhavaram Leather Manufacture Facility Private Limited and that there was no space for laying the pipeline along the bank of flood drain canal from Moolakkadai Junction to Kodungaiyur Sewage Treatment Plant. The court dismissed the writ petition.

The second court order discusses a project to lay a pipeline for Metro Water connection in certain streets, which has been objected to by residents. The court cites rules for regulating PILs and emphasizes that PILs must be filed in accordance with these rules. The court also cites previous decisions on PILs and warns against the abuse of the process for personal gain or private motives. The court stresses that PILs should be aimed at redressing genuine public wrongs or injuries and not for publicity or personal vendettas. The court must be satisfied with the credentials and information provided by the applicant before considering the PIL.

The third court order discusses the need for caution when entertaining public interest litigations, as they can be misused for personal gain or to delay legitimate administrative action. The court must ensure that the petitioner is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or political motivation. The court should also be careful not to encroach upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution to the Executive and the Legislature. The court must act ruthlessly while dealing with imposters and busybodies impersonating as public-spirited individuals. The court should filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique motives. The court must strike a balance between two conflicting interests: avoiding public mischief and preventing wild and reckless allegations besmirching the character of others.

The fourth court order emphasizes the need for caution in using public interest litigation (PIL) as a tool for justice. The court warns against frivolous and vexatious petitions filed by imposters and busybodies who have no genuine interest in public welfare. The court also notes that PILs should not encroach upon the sphere reserved for the executive and legislature. The court urges the judiciary to filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs. The court also highlights the importance of genuine litigants with legitimate grievances and the need to prioritize their cases over frivolous PILs. The court cites previous judgments and emphasizes that PILs should be used with great care and circumspection and not for personal gain or private motive. The court also notes that the judiciary must ensure that a petitioner is acting bona fide and not for ulterior motives. The court order also cites a previous case where an identical issue was dismissed, and the court urges the petitioner to seek impleadment in the pending case instead of filing a new petition.

The fifth court order states that a second writ petition for the same issue is unnecessary and will only increase litigation. The petitioner is not allowed to seek a Mandamus to consider their representation to realign the route for a Sewerage Treatment Plant as it has been rejected on multiple occasions. The writ petition is dismissed with no costs.

Overall, these court orders emphasize the need for caution and circumspection when filing PILs. The courts stress that PILs should be aimed at redressing genuine public wrongs or injuries and not for personal gain or political motives. The courts also warn against frivolous and vexatious petitions filed by imposters and busybodies who have no genuine interest in public welfare. The courts urge the judiciary to filter out frivolous petitions and dismiss them with costs to discourage oblique motives. The courts also highlight the importance of genuine litigants with legitimate grievances and the need to prioritize their cases over frivolous PILs.
