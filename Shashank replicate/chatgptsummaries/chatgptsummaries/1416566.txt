The Karnataka High Court recently heard several petitions related to the construction of a building in Mangalore, India. The petitioners sought the quashing of a building license and sanctioned plan issued to the fourth respondent by the Planning Authority and City Corporation. They also requested a direction to enforce the Zonal Regulations issued under the Outline Development Plan and Comprehensive Development Plan and the demolition of the offending structure put up by the fourth respondent. The court heard arguments from both sides, including objections to the petitioners' locus standi, and considered the alleged violations of the sanctioned plan and zoning regulations.

The Planning Authority had cancelled the Commencement Certificate for the construction due to violations of the sanctioned plan and Commencement Certificate. The fourth respondent challenged this in court, but the case was dismissed. The current case involves the petitioners challenging the reduction of the building line from 20 to 8.5 feet by the State Government, which they argue is not authorized. The court must determine the locus standi of the petitioners and whether the Writ Petitions are liable to be dismissed on the ground of malafides.

The petitioners in this case are rate payers and residents of Mangalore City who have challenged the construction of a multistoreyed building in the Hampankatta area, which is a busy commercial area with heavy traffic. The petitioners have stated that the construction violates the sanctioned plan and zoning regulations and would cause serious hazards to public safety and impede the free movement of traffic. The court has held that the petitioners have the locus standi to challenge the construction as they have a legal right to demand compliance with statutory rights, and their special interest as rate payers and residents is injured by the illegal construction. The court has also noted that the local authorities have a duty to observe the statutory rights of the public and prevent contraventions of statutory schemes like the Outline Development Plan, which are evolved for the public good.

The court order emphasizes the importance of adhering to the planned development of a city and strict scrutiny of any violations of zoning regulations. The court rejects the argument of delay and holds that any license or permission granted in contravention of the regulations is void. The court also upholds the right of rate-payers and residents of a locality to challenge any action that contravenes zoning regulations. The distinction is made between a public interest litigation and a petition by rate-payers and residents of a locality, who have a special interest recognized by the courts. The court directs the Commissioner of the Corporation to consider whether the building constructed was in accordance with the City Development Plan and Building Bye-laws.

The court order also discusses the rule of locus standi, which allows individuals with a legal right or legally protected interest to bring an action for judicial redress. Exceptions to this rule have been made for rate payers of local authorities who have a direct and immediate interest in the application of municipal funds. The court emphasizes the need for individuals to act bona fide and in the spirit of justice when seeking judicial redress, particularly in cases where they assert that their action is to vindicate the public interest. The court also discusses the need to maintain the rule of law and uphold zoning regulations in the context of a case involving a builder who violated building line requirements. The court ultimately quashes two government orders and instructs the respondents to consider the allegations of the petitioners regarding the builder's alleged deviations and illegalities.

The court considered the alleged violations of the sanctioned plan and zoning regulations and the petitioners' locus standi. The court emphasized the importance of adhering to the planned development of a city and strict scrutiny of any violations of zoning regulations.
