The court order pertains to a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, which sought a writ of mandamus to stop the installation of a solid waste dumping and micro composting process unit in Shakirabad. The petitioner argued that the site was not suitable for the purpose and lacked proper clearance from the Pollution Control Board. The Commissioner of Vaniyambadi Municipality filed a counter stating that the unit was a Micro Composting Centre and not a Solid Waste Dumping site or Sanitary Landfill, and that it was covered under Schedule-II of the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Notification.

The court order states that the Micro Composting Centre (MCC) in Vaniyambadi Taluk, Vellore District, Tamil Nadu, does not need authorization from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board as it is not covered under Schedule-I of the MOEFCC Notification dated 08.04.2016. The MCC is a pucca building with roofing and the entire unit is built up on RCC concrete floor and the processing tubs are brick built, as per the Schedule â€“ II A (e) of MOEFCC Notification dated 8/4/2016. The court also notes that the MCC is not a waste dumping unit and is necessary for the welfare of the locality. The MCC is built to cater to the public at large and is not intended to cause any hardship to the general public. The court order also mentions that the MCC is constructed in strict compliance with the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has authorized the Commissioner of Vaniyambadi Municipality to operate a waste processing/recycling/treatment/disposal facility for municipal solid waste. The authorization is valid until March 30, 2020, and subject to various conditions, including compliance with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, and orders of the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal. Violations of the rules will attract penal provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The local body must ensure 100% source segregation, and the facility must not accept e-waste, bio-medical waste, or industrial hazardous waste. The processing facility must take necessary steps to avoid contamination of groundwater and avoid landfill activity on the premises.

The court order outlines several conditions that must be met for the proper management and handling of municipal solid waste in the Vaniyambadi Municipality. These conditions include taking preventive measures to avoid contamination of nearby ground level water sumps, complying with Municipal Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, and ensuring that waste is not burnt in open or incineration facilities. The waste processing facility must also meet specified standards for composting and treated leachates, and compostable waste must be transported in covered vehicles to avoid spills and odors. The facility must operate without causing nuisance to neighbors or generating gases or odors, and any accidents must be reported immediately. The site must not be used as a dumping yard, and a buffer zone or no development zone must be maintained around the solid waste processing facility.

The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition, as the respondents had provided evidence that the micro composite center was built in compliance with regulations and was processing only bio-degradable waste. The court order lists the names and addresses of two individuals, the Principal Commissioner of the Municipal Administration Department in Chennai and the Commissioner of the Municipal Office in Vaniyambadi. It also includes the case numbers for two writ petitions filed in 2019.
