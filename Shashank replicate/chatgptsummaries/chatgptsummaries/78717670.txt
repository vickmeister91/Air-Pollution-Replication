The trial court dismissed the application, and the petitioner challenged the order before the Revision Court, which held that the order of the trial court was an interlocutory order and revision against such order is not maintainable.

The petitioner had argued that the earlier complaint filed by the complainant for dishonour of another cheque was relevant to the present case and should be taken into consideration. However, the court held that the present complaint is limited to the dishonour of a specific cheque, and other matters are not relevant to the trial of the present case. The court further observed that the petitioner had not been able to show any illegality or impropriety in the order of the trial court.
