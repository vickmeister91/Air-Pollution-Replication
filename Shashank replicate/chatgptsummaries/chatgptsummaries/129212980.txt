The Kerala High Court has recently ordered the revocation of a circular issued by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board that unilaterally revoked the consent to operate granted to two industrial units engaged in the production of skim crepe (rubber) without hearing them. The court quashed the orders revoking the consent to operate and directed the Chairman of the Board to reconsider the issue of renewal of consent. The court also ordered the Chairman of the Board to issue a fresh circular governing the field after hearing the petitioners within a month. The right to run the industrial units in question would be dependent on the orders to be passed afresh by the Chairman of the Board in compliance with the court's directions.

The case was brought before the court by two industrial units engaged in the production of skim crepe (rubber) who had been granted consent to operate by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The Board had unilaterally revoked the consent to operate without hearing the petitioners. The petitioners had argued that the Board had acted in violation of the principles of natural justice and had not given them an opportunity to be heard before revoking the consent to operate.

The court agreed with the petitioners and held that the Board had acted in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court observed that the Board had not given the petitioners an opportunity to be heard before revoking the consent to operate. The court held that the Board's action was arbitrary and violative of the petitioners' right to carry on their business.

The court quashed the orders revoking the consent to operate and directed the Chairman of the Board to reconsider the issue of renewal of consent. The court held that the Chairman of the Board should consider the issue of renewal of consent afresh after hearing the petitioners. The court also directed the Chairman of the Board to issue a fresh circular governing the field after hearing the petitioners within a month.

The court's order is significant as it upholds the principles of natural justice and ensures that the petitioners are given an opportunity to be heard before any adverse action is taken against them. The court's order also ensures that the Board acts in a fair and transparent manner and does not act arbitrarily.

The court's order is also significant as it recognizes the importance of the right to carry on business. The court held that the petitioners had a right to carry on their business and that the Board's action had violated this right. The court's order ensures that the petitioners are able to carry on their business without any arbitrary interference from the Board.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's order is a significant step towards upholding the principles of natural justice and ensuring that the Board acts in a fair and transparent manner.
