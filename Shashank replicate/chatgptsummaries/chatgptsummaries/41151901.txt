The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) filed a petition against Metro Paint Industries, challenging a court order that stated the respondent was not required to surrender any land to the DDA. The case involved the closure of hazardous industries in Delhi and the surrender of excess land. The Supreme Court had directed that industries surrender 57% of their land if they had land in excess of 2000 sq mtr and up to 5000 sq mtr. The issue arose as to whether industries that had stopped their hazardous units and started conforming/permissible use as per the Master Plan were still required to surrender their lands.

The Supreme Court clarified that those industries that had started conforming user prior to the passing of the order on 1.3.2001 were not required to surrender land, but those that had not started such industries with appropriate clearance from the competent authority must surrender the land. The court order states that industries that have not started conforming user industries with appropriate clearance from the competent authority cannot retain the land and must surrender it. This applies to industries that have not relocated their hazardous industries elsewhere. However, if they have relocated, they cannot benefit from this.

The final position is that industries that had stopped non-conforming use but had not started any fresh industry till 1.3.2001 were not exempted from the direction to surrender the land. Industries that had already started industries by 1.3.2001, which were conforming user as per the Master Plan, were held not liable to surrender any land. The respondent-industry had been given a license with respect to carrying out a conforming industry being cement products and was fully protected by para 31.Re(iv) of the judgment of the Supreme Court reported as (2001) 4 SCC 577 passed on 1.3.2001.

Therefore, the petition filed by the DDA against Metro Paint Industries was dismissed. The court order makes it clear that industries that have not started conforming user industries with appropriate clearance from the competent authority cannot retain the land and must surrender it. The order also clarifies that industries that had stopped non-conforming use but had not started any fresh industry till 1.3.2001 were not exempted from the direction to surrender the land. Industries that had already started industries by 1.3.2001, which were conforming user as per the Master Plan, were held not liable to surrender any land.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to regulations and obtaining appropriate clearances from competent authorities. Industries that fail to comply with regulations and clearances risk losing their land and facing legal action. The court order also emphasizes the need for hazardous industries to be closed down and excess land to be surrendered to prevent environmental damage and health hazards. The order serves as a reminder to industries to prioritize environmental and health concerns and comply with regulations to avoid legal consequences.
