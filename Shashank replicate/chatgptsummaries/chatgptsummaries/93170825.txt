The Central Bank of India filed a writ petition to quash an order passed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) demanding penalty and threatening sealing of the property. The petitioner had been a tenant in the property since 1970 and had attorned to different landlords at different periods of time. The NDMC had issued a notice demanding penalty and also threatened sealing, and a notice of attachment was issued by respondent no.1. The petitioner filed a detailed representation and appeared for personal hearing, but the impugned order was passed on 01.01.2013, and consequently, the notice dated 29.05.2015 was issued for recovery of the said amount.

The learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the representation made to the respondent no.1 raising four issues. However, on 02.01.2013, a speaking order was passed to the effect that the charges levied were on account of violations of the provisions of the MPD-2021 and regarding responsibility for payment of penalty amount in terms of the lease deed.

The court order states that the charges levied on a property are due to violations of the provisions of MPD-2021, and the responsibility for payment of penalty amount is on the petitioner. The violation of MPD-2021 is proved as the branch of Central Bank of India was running from the said premises without registration and requisite payment. The payment on account of penalty for amounting to Rs.18,77,696/- has to be made to NDMC. Besides this, the area put under Mixed use for running Bank Activity needs to be restored within 2/3rd of the permissible FAR i.e. 163.42 sq.m including registration of the premises.

The court also notes that the petitioner is responsible for paying user charges as demanded by the respondent. The only issue remaining is whether the penalty of 10 times the user charges can be levied or not, and the court states that it has statutory binding and cannot be set aside.
