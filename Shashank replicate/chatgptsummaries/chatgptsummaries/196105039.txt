The court order pertains to a series of civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The controversy involves mining activity in the Rishabhdev area of Udaipur, Rajasthan, and the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The government issued a notification in 2015 requiring the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) of forest land in two equal installments within two years, which the petitioner and other mining lease holders deposited under protest. The court heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.

One of the petitions pertains to a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The petitioner and 62 other mining lease holders had already deposited the compensation amount, while the remaining lease holders either surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argued that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the compensation as they were not responsible for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and the common area being utilized by cluster members. The court heard arguments from both sides and examined various documents related to the case.

Another petition pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area and wish that the proposal should be extended for the entire area.

Another petition pertains to a dispute between mining lease holders and the Forest Department over the payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land. The court found that the mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, which was approved in 2000. The mining lease holders refused to pay the NPV amount for the entire area, but also refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the cluster area. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including their share in the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, and houses of workers, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.

Overall, the court order addresses multiple civil writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan, Department of Mines & Geology, and other government officials regarding mining leases and forest clearances. The court has heard all the petitions together and reserved judgment on May 27, 2019, and pronounced it on May 30, 2019.
