The court order in question pertains to two petitions filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The petitions sought to quash an order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate of the First Class in Manantoddy, in relation to a case pending before the Magistrate. The case in question was O.R. No. 2 of 1980 of Kannoth Range in Wynad Forest Division, and the petitioners were accused in the case.

The Magistrate had ordered the release of the petitioners on bail, but the Deputy Superintendent of Police, C.I.D. Forest Cell, Bangalore (Karnataka) filed an application before the Magistrate to hand them over, along with the other accused, to police custody for investigation of several crimes registered in Mysore District. The Magistrate had committed an error of law in directing the accused to be handed over to the Karnataka Police after granting bail.

The court set aside the order forwarding the accused-petitioners to the Karnataka Police. The court held that the Magistrate had erred in law by directing the accused to be handed over to the Karnataka Police after granting bail. The court observed that the Magistrate had no power to order the accused to be handed over to the Karnataka Police for investigation of crimes registered in Mysore District. The court held that the Magistrate had exceeded his jurisdiction in passing the order.

The court further observed that the order passed by the Magistrate was not only illegal but also unjust. The court noted that the accused had been granted bail by the Magistrate, and there was no reason to hand them over to the Karnataka Police for investigation of crimes registered in Mysore District. The court held that the order passed by the Magistrate was arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights of the accused.

The court also observed that the order passed by the Magistrate was against the principles of natural justice. The court noted that the accused had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the order was passed. The court held that the order passed by the Magistrate was therefore null and void.

In light of the above, the court set aside the order passed by the Magistrate and directed that the accused be released on bail. The court also directed that the accused be produced before the Magistrate on the next date of hearing.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to two petitions filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court set aside an order passed by the Magistrate, which had directed the accused to be handed over to the Karnataka Police for investigation of crimes registered in Mysore District. The court held that the Magistrate had erred in law and exceeded his jurisdiction in passing the order. The court further held that the order passed by the Magistrate was arbitrary, violative of the fundamental rights of the accused, and against the principles of natural justice. The court directed that the accused be released on bail and produced before the Magistrate on the next date of hearing.
