The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the treatment of an elephant named Sunder who was being kept in captivity in poor conditions. The first court order involves a writ petition filed by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents regarding the treatment of animals. The respondents include the Chief Wildlife Warden, Ministry of Forests, Rehabilitation & Relief Works, the Chairman of Devasthan Management Committee, and the Central Zoo Authority. Another writ petition was filed by Shri Vinay V. Kore, MLA, against the State of Maharashtra and other respondents regarding the treatment of elephants. The court order lists the lawyers representing each party.

The second court order is regarding the welfare of Sunder. Two petitions were filed, one by a charitable organization and the other by a member of the legislative assembly. The petitions seek to quash ownership certificates and direct the authorities to set Sunder free and relocate him to a wildlife rescue center. The court heard both petitions and reserved judgment on March 20, 2014, and pronounced the judgment on April 7, 2014. The court ordered that Sunder be released and relocated to a wildlife rescue center.

The third court order pertains to the mistreatment of Sunder at a temple in Kolhapur, Maharashtra. The Animal Welfare Officer filed a complaint against the temple for keeping Sunder chained, administering sedatives, and denying him food, water, and walks. The court ordered Sunder to be relocated to a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center in Bangalore. However, a Member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly promised to establish a suitable facility for Sunder's welfare and requested that Sunder be allowed to remain at the temple. The petitioner seeks the enforcement of the relocation order and the quashing of the ownership certificate.

The fourth court order pertains to a petition seeking enforcement of an order issued by the Joint Secretary (Forests), Revenue and Forest Department, and quashing of an ownership certificate. The petitioner has taken up the issue of ownership and a complaint is pending before the appropriate authority. Respondent No.4 disputes the jurisdiction of the Joint Secretary and denies all allegations of ill-treatment of the elephant. The court has considered various affidavits and reports, including an assessment report that highlights the elephant's stereotypical behavior, lack of exercise, and deficient nutrition. The court has directed the authority to consider the application without undue delay and has noted that Sunder is distressed and disturbed only when his own mahout or assistant mahout approach him, indicating that he is not being treated humanely.

The fifth court order pertains to the case of Sunder who was being kept in captivity in poor conditions. The court received affidavits and photographs showing the elephant's aggressive behavior and physical injuries from chaining. The court ordered Sunder to be transported to an elephant care and rehabilitation center for immediate enrichment of environment and to avoid further permanent damage to his mental status. The court also noted that elephants are highly cognitive and intelligent animals and that it is in Sunder's best interest to be kept in natural surroundings. The court rejected the argument that Sunder should be retained by the Devasthan or Warananagar Group and upheld the jurisdiction of the State Government to issue directions for the welfare of captive elephants.

The sixth court order directs that Sunder be transported to a facility in Bengaluru in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The court cites the Doctrine of public trust and Article 51A(g) of the Constitution of India, which mandate the protection and conservation of wildlife and the natural environment. The court also notes that translocation of animals is not uncommon and that laws tend to be biased towards humans, so it is the court's duty to ensure balance in the system. The court dismisses a related writ petition and denies a request for a stay of the order.

In summary, the court orders all pertain to the treatment of Sunder, an elephant who was being kept in captivity in poor conditions. The court ordered Sunder to be released and relocated to a wildlife rescue center, and later to a wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center in Bangalore. The court rejected arguments that Sunder should be retained by the Devasthan or Warananagar Group and upheld the jurisdiction of the State Government to issue directions for the welfare of captive elephants. The court cited the Doctrine of public trust and Article 51A(g) of the Constitution of India, which mandate the protection and conservation of wildlife and the natural environment.
