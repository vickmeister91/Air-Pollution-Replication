In a recent court order, an application filed by Pranish Jasathi was dismissed by the court. The application was filed against an order passed on an application filed by the applicant under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. However, the court noted that nobody had appeared in the matter for a long time and the applicant seemed uninterested in prosecuting the application. Therefore, the application was dismissed for want of prosecution.

Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also allows the court to direct any person to make a statement or furnish information that is necessary for the purpose of any such investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding.

In this case, it appears that Pranish Jasathi had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking the production of certain documents or things that were necessary for the purpose of an investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding. However, the court had passed an order on the application filed by the applicant, which was the subject matter of the present application filed by Pranish Jasathi.

It is not clear from the court order what the order passed on the application filed by the applicant was. However, it appears that Pranish Jasathi was not satisfied with the order and had filed an application challenging the same. The court, however, noted that nobody had appeared in the matter for a long time and the applicant seemed uninterested in prosecuting the application.

The court's observation raises questions about the seriousness of the application filed by Pranish Jasathi. It is not clear why Pranish Jasathi did not appear in the matter for a long time or why he seemed uninterested in prosecuting the application. It is possible that Pranish Jasathi had lost interest in the matter or had realized that the application was not likely to succeed.

The court's decision to dismiss the application for want of prosecution is not uncommon. Courts often dismiss applications or cases when the parties fail to appear or show interest in prosecuting the same. This is done to ensure that the court's time is not wasted and that the parties are serious about pursuing their claims.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss Pranish Jasathi's application for want of prosecution highlights the importance of being serious and committed when filing applications or cases in court. Parties must ensure that they appear in court and actively pursue their claims to avoid having their applications or cases dismissed.
