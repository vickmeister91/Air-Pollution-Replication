The court order discusses a dispute over the payment of compensation for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. Only 63 out of 136 mining lease holders, including the petitioner, had deposited the required amount, while the rest surrendered their leases or had them cancelled. The petitioner argues that they should not be required to pay the second installment of the Net Present Value (NPV) for the vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas. The petitioner also cites a government letter stating that the provisions of NPV do not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected. The court considers the status of the cluster at the time of diversion and the present status of the diverted cluster. The case involves complex legal and technical issues related to mining and forest land use.

The court order pertains to a demand notice for payment of NPV (Net Present Value) amount for the extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for the diversion of forest land for the entire cluster area of 281 hectares, and approval was given for the same. However, out of the 136 mining leases, 62 of the leases have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed. The court has been requested to give directions to the Forest Department, Government of Rajasthan to extend the period of validity of diversion subject to certain conditions. The court has also been informed that the mining lease holders do not deserve any relief as they have refused to get the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases segregated from the entire cluster area.

The court order pertains to a cluster area of 281 hectares of forest land in Udaipur, where 136 mining lease holders collectively submitted a proposal for diversion of forest land. The court found that the mining lease holders did not deserve any relief as they refused to segregate the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed mining leases from the entire cluster area and also refused to pay the Net Present Value (NPV) amount for the entire 281 hectares. The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount for each lease holder individually, including the common areas being used for storing machines and equipment, offices, houses, and dumping areas, but excluding the 62 mining leases that have been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. The court also directed the Mining Department to pursue appropriate relinquishment proceedings for these leases.
