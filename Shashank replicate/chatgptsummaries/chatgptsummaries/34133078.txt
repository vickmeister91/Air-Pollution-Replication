The Rajasthan High Court recently granted bail to two accused, Basant and Tantu, who were charged with killing a Sambhar by giving it a poisonous substance. The court order pertains to a bail application filed by the accused, who had been in custody since May 17, 2019. The court noted that no poisonous substance was found in the medical report, which was a crucial factor in granting bail to the accused.

The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicants to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 each with one surety each. The court also imposed certain conditions on the applicants, including cooperating in the trial and not leaving India without the trial court's permission. The order will remain effective until the end of the trial, but will be cancelled if the applicants breach any of the pre-conditions of bail.

The case pertains to the killing of a Sambhar, which is a protected animal under the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were charged with killing the animal by giving it a poisonous substance. The incident had taken place in the Kailadevi sanctuary in Rajasthan, and the accused were arrested soon after the incident.

The bail application was filed by the accused on the grounds that they had been in custody for a long time and that there was no evidence against them. The court noted that the accused had been in custody for more than a year and that there was no evidence to suggest that they were a flight risk or that they would tamper with the evidence.

The court also took into account the fact that the accused had no criminal record and that they were not likely to commit any offence while on bail. The court, therefore, granted bail to the accused on the condition that they cooperate in the trial and do not leave India without the trial court's permission.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused has been met with mixed reactions. While some have welcomed the decision, others have criticized it, saying that it sends the wrong message to poachers and wildlife smugglers. The Wildlife Protection Act is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to protect India's rich biodiversity, and any violation of the Act should be dealt with strictly.

However, it is important to note that the court's decision was based on the evidence presented before it and the legal principles governing bail. The court noted that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused were guilty of the offence and that they had been in custody for a long time. The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is, therefore, in line with the principles of natural justice and the rule of law.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's decision to grant bail to the accused in the Sambhar killing case is a significant development in the ongoing trial. The court's decision was based on the evidence presented before it and the legal principles governing bail. While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, it is important to note that the court's decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and the rule of law. The accused will now have to cooperate in the trial and abide by the conditions imposed by the court.
