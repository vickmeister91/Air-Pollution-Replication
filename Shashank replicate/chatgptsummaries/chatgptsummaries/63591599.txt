The trial court dismissed both petitions, and the accused appealed to the High Court.

The first petition filed by the accused was under Section 91 Cr.P.C. for summoning the enquiry report.

The court further stated that the accused had not made out a case for summoning the enquiry report. The court observed that the accused had not shown how the report would help him in proving his innocence. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition.

The second petition filed by the accused was under Section 242 Cr.P.C. for examining Mr.Sunil as a defense witness. The accused contended that Mr.Sunil was a material witness and his evidence would enhance the case of the accused. However, the trial court dismissed the petition, stating that the evidence of Mr.Sunil cannot enhance the case of the accused. The accused appealed to the High Court, arguing that the evidence of Mr.Sunil was necessary to prove his innocence.

The High Court, after hearing both parties, dismissed the petition. The court held that the evidence of Mr.Sunil cannot enhance the case of the accused. The court further stated that the accused had not made out a case for examining Mr.Sunil as a defense witness.
