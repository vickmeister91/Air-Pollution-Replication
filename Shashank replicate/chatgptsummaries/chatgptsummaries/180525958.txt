The Madras High Court has issued several court orders related to environmental protection and waste management in Tamil Nadu. The Global Warming Environment Protecting Society filed a public interest litigation requesting a writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to take appropriate action to reduce and protect air and water pollution in slum areas, dispose of solid waste at two dumping yards, and save the lives of people living in affected areas. The respondents include the Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu, the Ministry of Environment Forest, Climate Change, the Ministry of Urban Development Dept., the Industries Department, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and others. The court has ordered the respondents to consider the representation and take appropriate action.

However, the court has determined that the issue of solid waste disposal and pollution falls under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, and therefore the petitioner should present their petition before the National Green Tribunal. The disposal of solid waste is already being monitored by the National Green Tribunal, and the court cites an order from August 2018 regarding the matter. The court proposes the constitution of an Apex Monitoring Committee, Regional Monitoring Committees, and State Level Committees to oversee the implementation of the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Apex Monitoring Committee will be chaired by Honâ€™ble Mr. Justice D.K. Jain, among others.

The court order also establishes an Apex Monitoring Committee and Regional Monitoring Committees to ensure effective implementation of The Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016. The Apex Monitoring Committee will have members from various government departments and special invitees. The Regional Monitoring Committees will ensure compliance with the rules and prevent the mixing of bio-medical waste with municipal solid waste. They will also interact with the concerned states and may solicit the service of special invitees. The constitution of the Regional Monitoring Committees will vary by zone. The committees will be paid remuneration and logistic support as required by the Department of Urban Development. The committees may function for a period of one year subject to any further order.

The court order lists the members of various State Pollution Control Boards and Central Pollution Control Board in different zones of India, including their respective Principal Secretaries and Representatives. The order also directs the formation of a South Zone-Chennai with specific members listed.
