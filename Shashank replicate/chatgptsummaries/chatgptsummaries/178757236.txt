In September 2016, the Central India Ayush Drugs Manufacturers Association and other companies filed a writ petition seeking a declaration that Rule 17 of the Biological Diversity Rules, 2004 does not apply to Indian entities or body corporates. They also prayed that the rule, which envisages equitable sharing of benefits by Indian entities, should be declared ultra vires to the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 and therefore unconstitutional. The court heard preliminary objections and issued a judgment on September 28, 2016.

The court order declares that benefits received by Indian entities from biological resources are unconstitutional and ultra vires to the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The court also seeks a declaration that the Guidelines on Access to Biological Resources and Associated Knowledge and Benefits Sharing Regulations, 2014 only apply to transactions involving non-Indian entities. The court hears arguments from both sides, with one side arguing that the case should be raised before the National Green Tribunal, while the other side argues that the Tribunal does not possess jurisdiction to look into challenges to the vires of any Act or Rule.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal and its ability to examine challenges related to the implementation of the B.D. Act. The order also lists seven enactments included in Schedule-I of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, which provide for channels of grievance redressal and appeals to the National Green Tribunal. The order concludes that the National Green Tribunal can examine challenges related to the implementation of the B.D. Act, as long as they arise under the seven enactments listed in Schedule-I.

The court order discusses various sections of different acts related to the jurisdiction and powers of the National Green Tribunal (NGT). It explains that the NGT has the power to settle disputes and grant relief, compensation, and restitution under certain conditions and time limits. It also mentions the procedure for filing an application or appeal to the Tribunal. The order emphasizes the need to interpret the provisions of the NGT Act in the context of these other acts.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction and procedures of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in India. It explains that the NGT has appellate jurisdiction under various enactments and against certain orders, but this is distinct from its jurisdiction under Sections 14 and 15 of the NGT Act. The order also clarifies that civil cases must be related to the environment and arise out of implementation of Schedule-I enactments to be cognizable by the NGT. The order cites previous judgments and legal principles to support its analysis.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal under the N.G.T. Act. It states that the Tribunal can only consider civil cases that affect the environment, and that the cause giving rise to the case must have some impact on the environment to make it a substantial question. The definition of "environment" and "substantial question relating to environment" are also discussed. The order cites previous court judgments to support its interpretation of the law.

The Administrative Tribunal functioning at the Center or in States under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985 is an independent body not interested in disputes between employer State and its employees. Its jurisdiction to decide such disputes is absolute and not limited by any stipulation in the enactment. The National Green Tribunal has a limited jurisdiction to deal with specific types of civil disputes related to the environment and cannot be said to be conferred with the absolute jurisdiction to adjudicate all types of disputes or even all civil disputes. The power to pronounce upon the vires of any statutory provision or of any subordinate legislation cannot be read into any of the provisions which confer either appellate or original jurisdiction upon National Green Tribunal. The scheme of the N.G.T. Act does not permit the National Green Tribunal to decide upon the vires of any of the enactments which confer appellate or other jurisdiction upon it and find mention in Schedule-I of N.G.T. Act. The petitioners do not have any alternate remedy before the National Green Tribunal to raise its challenge in this writ petition.

In summary, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by the Central India Ayush Drugs Manufacturers Association and other companies seeking a declaration that Rule 17 of the Biological Diversity Rules, 2004 does not apply to Indian entities or body corporates. The court declares that benefits received by Indian entities from biological resources are unconstitutional and ultra vires to the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and procedures of the National Green Tribunal in India and clarifies that civil cases must be related to the environment and arise out of implementation of Schedule-I enactments to be cognizable by the NGT. The order emphasizes the need to interpret the provisions of the NGT Act in the context of other acts and cites previous judgments and legal principles to support its analysis. The court concludes that the petitioners do not have any alternate remedy before the National Green Tribunal to raise its challenge in this writ petition.
