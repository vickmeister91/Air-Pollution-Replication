The Bombay High Court recently received a petition from M/S. G.R. Infra Projects Ltd. challenging an order to issue process against them for alleged offenses under various pollution control acts. The company had set up a ready mix concrete plant after obtaining necessary permissions, but some individuals harassed them and made false complaints, leading to the closure of the plant without a hearing. The court found that the order was passed without due application of mind and a prima facie case did not exist, and therefore the petition deserved to be heard.

The court has ordered that notice be issued to the respondents and the trial court is directed to defer the hearing of the case until August 7th, 2019. The case will stand over until August 6th, 2019. The petitioner's representation has been relied upon and the petition will be heard after notice to the respondents.
