The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Nagu Nayaka, who was accused of violating the Wildlife Protection Act. The petitioner sought anticipatory bail in the event of his arrest, and the court granted the bail subject to certain conditions.

The order begins by outlining the nature of the allegations against the petitioner. According to the order, Nayaka was accused of violating Sections 9, 39, and 50 of the Wildlife Protection Act, which deal with hunting, possession of wildlife, and penalties for offenses under the Act. The order also notes that the investigating officer had already arrested three other accused persons in connection with the case.

The court then goes on to consider the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail. The order notes that the petitioner had filed the petition under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows a person to seek anticipatory bail if they believe they may be arrested for a non-bailable offense. The court observes that there is no impediment to granting anticipatory bail in this case, and proceeds to do so subject to certain conditions.

The conditions of the bail are outlined in the order. The petitioner is required to furnish a bond of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of the same amount. He is also required to cooperate with the investigating officer and attend all court hearings related to the case. In addition, the petitioner is prohibited from leaving the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

Overall, the court order in this case is relatively straightforward. It grants anticipatory bail to the petitioner, subject to certain conditions, on the grounds that there is no impediment to doing so. The order also provides some background information on the nature of the allegations against the petitioner and the status of the investigation.
