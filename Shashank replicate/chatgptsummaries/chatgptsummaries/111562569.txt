In a recent court order, a petition filed by Dilip Sakargayen against Pramod Chaturvedi under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. was dismissed. The court granted the dismissal with the liberty for Sakargayen to file an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. at the time of defense statement. However, the court also ruled that Sakargayen cannot call the complainant again under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, Sakargayen had filed a petition under this section against Chaturvedi.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition means that the case will not proceed further on the basis of the petition filed by Sakargayen. However, the court has granted him the liberty to file an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. at the time of defense statement. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the power of the court to summon and examine any person as a witness or to produce any document or other thing for the purpose of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

This means that Sakargayen can file an application under this section to summon and examine any person or produce any document or other thing that he believes will help his case. However, the court has also ruled that he cannot call the complainant again under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C.

Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the power of the court to summon any person as a witness or to examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or to recall and re-examine any person already examined, if it appears to the court that such person is able to throw light upon the matter in dispute. In this case, the court has ruled that Sakargayen cannot use this section to call the complainant again.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition and grant Sakargayen the liberty to file an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. while also restricting him from using Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. to call the complainant again is significant. It shows that the court is willing to consider the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, but is also mindful of the need to prevent abuse of the legal process and ensure that justice is served.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of understanding the various sections of the Cr.P.C. and how they can be used in legal proceedings. It also emphasizes the need for parties to present their case effectively and efficiently, while also respecting the legal process and the decisions of the court.
