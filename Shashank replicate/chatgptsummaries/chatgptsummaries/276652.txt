The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Jesubalan against the State Inspector of Police. Jesubalan had filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking documents related to the investigation of a case against him. However, the court dismissed the application, stating that the accused is not entitled to call for police diaries under Section 172 of Cr.P.C. and that the diaries mentioned in the application were not required to be maintained by the police.

The court cited a Supreme Court decision that police diaries do not contain substantive or corroborative evidence and cannot be used by or against any other witness than the police officer. This decision was based on the fact that police diaries are not meant to be a record of evidence, but rather a record of the day-to-day activities of the police officer. Therefore, the court held that the accused cannot rely on police diaries to prove his innocence or to challenge the prosecution's case.

The court also noted that the police diaries mentioned in the application were not required to be maintained by the police. Section 172 of Cr.P.C. requires the police officer in charge of a case to maintain a diary of the investigation, but this diary need not contain every detail of the investigation. The diary is meant to be a brief record of the investigation, and the police officer is not required to record every conversation or action taken during the investigation.

In light of these facts, the court dismissed the application filed by Jesubalan. The court held that the accused is not entitled to call for police diaries under Section 172 of Cr.P.C. and that the diaries mentioned in the application were not required to be maintained by the police. The court also cited the Supreme Court decision that police diaries do not contain substantive or corroborative evidence and cannot be used by or against any other witness than the police officer.

The revision filed by Jesubalan was also dismissed by the court. The court held that there was no merit in the revision, and that the application filed by Jesubalan was closed. This decision by the court reaffirms the principle that police diaries are not meant to be a record of evidence, but rather a record of the day-to-day activities of the police officer. Therefore, the accused cannot rely on police diaries to prove his innocence or to challenge the prosecution's case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal revision case filed by Jesubalan against the State Inspector of Police. The court dismissed the application filed by Jesubalan under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. seeking documents related to the investigation of a case against him. The court held that the accused is not entitled to call for police diaries under Section 172 of Cr.P.C. and that the diaries mentioned in the application were not required to be maintained by the police. The court also cited a Supreme Court decision that police diaries do not contain substantive or corroborative evidence and cannot be used by or against any other witness than the police officer. The revision filed by Jesubalan was also dismissed by the court, and the application was closed. This decision reaffirms the principle that police diaries are not meant to be a record of evidence, but rather a record of the day-to-day activities of the police officer.
