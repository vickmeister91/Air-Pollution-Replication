The court order in question pertains to a case filed by Pankajbhai against the State of Gujarat for offences under the Bombay Prohibition Act. The court has allowed the application for bail and ordered the applicant to be released on bail on certain conditions.

The first condition is that the applicant must execute a bond of Rs. 5,000. This is a common requirement for bail, as it ensures that the accused will appear in court for their trial. If they fail to do so, the bond will be forfeited.

The second condition is that the applicant must surrender their passport. This is also a common requirement for bail, as it prevents the accused from leaving the country and avoiding trial.

The third condition is that the applicant must mark their presence at the police station on the first Sunday of every month. This is a relatively uncommon requirement, but it is not unheard of. It ensures that the accused is still in the country and available for trial.

The fourth condition is that the applicant must not leave the state without prior permission. This is another common requirement for bail, as it ensures that the accused does not flee the jurisdiction and avoid trial.

Finally, the court has ordered that the trial court is not to be influenced by the observations made by the High Court while granting bail. This is an important point, as it ensures that the trial court will make its decision based solely on the evidence presented in court, rather than being swayed by the High Court's decision to grant bail.

Overall, this court order is fairly standard for a bail application. The conditions imposed are designed to ensure that the accused appears in court for their trial and does not flee the jurisdiction. The order also ensures that the trial court will make its decision based solely on the evidence presented in court, rather than being influenced by the High Court's decision to grant bail.
