The Madras High Court recently received writ petitions from various trade unions representing plantation workers in Valparai and Anaimalai areas in Coimbatore District. The unions claimed that the Planters Association of Tamil Nadu intended to terminate settlements regarding wages and working conditions, which had been in place since 1962. The unions objected to the proposed changes, which would result in a reduction of wages and incentives, and increased workload.

The court considered issues such as the maintainability of the writ petition, alternative remedies, whether the Conciliation Proceeding was pending, and whether the notice given to the Association was sufficient to bind individual employers. The court order discusses the issue of whether a writ can be issued against a private company or individual under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court cites previous judgments, including V.S.T. Industries Ltd. v. V.S.T. Industries Workers' Union, which states that a writ can be issued against a private person or company if they violate statutory or public duties or engage in monstrous activities.

The court also notes that the Industrial Disputes Act involves public interest and duty, and therefore, a mandamus can be issued against private companies in cases of gross violation of statute or public duty. The court ultimately concludes that the writ petitions in question are maintainable. The court order states that a writ can be issued against a private body in the context of gross violation of statute or public duty. The court also concludes that the writ petitions in this case are maintainable and that the judgment in a previous case does not affect the facts of this case.

The court discusses the issue of alternate remedy and the monstrosity of the issue, stating that the necessity of seeking permission of the authority during the pendency of the dispute is a mandatory requirement and a precondition before the management could seek to alter the conditions of service. The court also notes that resort to Section 33A of the Act is not an effective or an alternate remedy. The court concludes that the plea of Section 33A as being an alternate remedy cannot be sustained, more so in a case where the management intentionally and with impunity violates Section 33(1) of the Act.

The court order states that an order of discharge or dismissal remains valid unless set aside under Section 33A. The court also concludes that the plea of Section 33A as an alternate remedy cannot be sustained, especially when it is the management that initiated the conciliation proceedings. The court also rejects the argument that the conciliation proceedings are no longer pending and that the notice given to the Planters' Association of Tamil Nadu (PAT) is sufficient to bind individual employers/estates.

The court allows the writ petitions and grants the respondents the liberty to move the Conciliation Officer for permission under Section 33(1) of the Act before altering the conditions of service. The court's decision is significant as it upholds the rights of workers and ensures that private companies are held accountable for their actions. The court's ruling also highlights the importance of maintaining settlements regarding wages and working conditions, which are crucial for the well-being of workers. Overall, the court's decision is a step towards ensuring that workers' rights are protected and that private companies are held accountable for their actions.
