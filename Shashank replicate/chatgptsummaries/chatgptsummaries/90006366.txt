The court order pertains to three separate cases, each with its own unique set of circumstances and legal arguments. In the first case, M/s Dharampal Satyapal Ltd filed an appeal against the Customs, Excise & Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) upholding the demand of the Revenue with reference to Section 154 of the Finance Act, 2003. The appellant had been granted an exemption under Section 5-A of the Act read with sub-section(3) of Section 3 of the Additional Duties of Excise Goods of Special Importance Act, 1957 and sub-section(3) of Section 3 of the Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile articles) Act, 1978. However, the exemption was retrospectively withdrawn, and the appellant was ordered to repay the amount of exemption availed. The appellant claimed several substantial questions of law, but the court dismissed the appeal and upheld the order for recovery of the amount of exemption availed by the appellant.

In the second case, a Deputy Commissioner ordered the recovery of unpaid duty on goods cleared by the petitioner during a certain period. The petitioner had been adjusting their duty liability and claiming refunds, but the notification regarding this had been amended retrospectively. The appellate authority found fault with the non-issuance of a show cause notice to the petitioner, but ultimately rejected their stay application and ordered them to deposit the entire amount before the appeal could be heard. The order also discusses the concept of natural justice and the principle of prejudice, noting that the absence of a notice to show cause does not make a difference if no prejudice is shown. The case was remanded for fresh consideration, but the CESTAT ultimately held that the appeal was not maintainable and the objection to the recovery proceeding was not open to the petitioner.

In the third case, the court found that the lower Appellate Authority was not justified in allowing the appeals and setting aside the Order-in-Original, due to the specific provision regarding non-maintainability of appeal contained in Section 154(3) of the Finance Act, 2003 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court's decision in the case of R.C. Tabacco. The appellant's submission that they were not given an opportunity to be heard and that the validity of the order was in question was rejected, as the issue had already been decided in a previous writ petition and had become res judicata. The appeal was dismissed with no costs.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of understanding the specific provisions and legal arguments at play in each case. While some appeals may be dismissed due to technicalities or previous legal decisions, others may be upheld if substantial questions of law are raised. It is crucial for parties involved in legal disputes to seek the advice of experienced legal professionals and to carefully consider their options before filing an appeal or challenging a court order.
