The Trial Court had dismissed the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to prove the negligence of the defendants. However, the plaintiffs appealed the decision, arguing that the MPEB was negligent and failed to maintain the electric wires properly.

The court set aside the Trial Court's decision and awarded a lump sum compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/- with simple interest.
