Shiv Kumar, a resident of Haryana, had filed an application for anticipatory bail in connection with a case registered against him under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution had alleged that Kumar had hunted a barking deer along with other co-accused persons. Kumar's counsel had argued that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case.

The case had been registered against Kumar and his co-accused persons under Sections 9, 27, 29, and 30 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Section 9 of the Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 27 prohibits possession of any animal, animal article, or trophy. Section 29 prohibits the sale, purchase, or transport of any animal, animal article, or trophy, while Section 30 provides for punishment for abetment and attempt to commit offences under the Act.

During the hearing of the anticipatory bail application, Kumar's counsel had submitted that he had no criminal antecedents and had been falsely implicated in the case. The counsel had further submitted that Kumar was a law-abiding citizen and had cooperated with the investigating agency during the investigation.

The prosecution, on the other hand, had opposed the anticipatory bail application and had submitted that Kumar had committed a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution had further submitted that Kumar was a flight risk and may abscond if granted anticipatory bail.

After hearing the arguments of both the parties, the court had allowed Kumar's anticipatory bail on the condition that he complies with certain terms and conditions. The court had directed Kumar to cooperate in the investigation/trial and not to commit a similar offence. The court had further directed Kumar to furnish a personal bond and surety bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000 each.

The court had also directed Kumar to report to the investigating officer once a week for a period of four weeks and thereafter as and when required by the investigating officer. The court had further directed Kumar to surrender his passport, if any, to the investigating officer and not to leave the country without the permission of the court.

In conclusion, the court had allowed Shiv Kumar's anticipatory bail application on the condition that he complies with certain terms and conditions, including cooperating in the investigation/trial and not committing a similar offence. The court had also directed Kumar to furnish a personal bond and surety bond in the sum of Rs. 50,000 each and to report to the investigating officer once a week for a period of four weeks and thereafter as and when required by the investigating officer. The court had further directed Kumar to surrender his passport, if any, to the investigating officer and not to leave the country without the permission of the court.
