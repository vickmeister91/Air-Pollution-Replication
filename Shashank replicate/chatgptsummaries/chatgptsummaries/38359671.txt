On November 4th, 2019, a court order was issued regarding a bail application filed by two individuals facing charges in Assam. The case is against the State of Assam and a special counsel has been appointed to represent the respondent.

The court order does not provide details about the charges faced by the two individuals, but it is clear that they are seeking bail. Bail is a legal process that allows a person who has been arrested and charged with a crime to be released from custody while they await trial. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person appears in court for their trial and does not flee or commit further crimes while they are out of custody.

The court order lists the names of the two individuals who have filed the bail application, but their identities are not disclosed in the public record. It is also not clear whether they are being held in custody or are currently out on bail.

The case is against the State of Assam, which suggests that the charges may be related to a crime committed within the state. The court order does not provide any further information about the nature of the charges or the circumstances of the alleged crime.

The fact that a special counsel has been appointed to represent the respondent suggests that this is a high-profile case or one that is particularly complex. Special counsel are typically appointed in cases where the interests of the government or other public entities are at stake, or where the case involves complex legal issues.

The court order sets the date for a hearing on November 4th, 2019. It is not clear whether this will be the only hearing in the case or whether there will be further proceedings. The outcome of the hearing is also unknown, as the court order does not provide any indication of what the two individuals are seeking in their bail application or what arguments the special counsel will make in response.

Overall, the court order provides limited information about the case and the individuals involved. It is clear that two individuals are seeking bail in a case against the State of Assam, but the nature of the charges and the circumstances of the alleged crime are not disclosed. The appointment of a special counsel suggests that this is a significant case, but the outcome of the hearing on November 4th, 2019 is unknown.
