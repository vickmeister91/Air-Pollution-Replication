The court order pertains to a bail application filed by Prakash Sahu under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Sahu was arrested on 21.12.2018 by Police Station Dehat, District Ashoknagar in connection with Crime No.713/2018 registered in relation to the offence punishable under Sections 9 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court allowed the bail application and directed the applicant to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties, each of Rs.25,000/-.

The court also imposed certain stringent conditions on Sahu. These conditions include compliance with all the terms and conditions of the bond, cooperation in the investigation/trial, not committing an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial, and not leaving India without previous permission of the trial Court/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. The applicant shall mark his attendance before the concerned trial Court once a week till investigation is over.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act has been amended several times since its enactment, with the latest amendment being in 2006.

Section 9 of the Act deals with hunting of wild animals. It states that whoever hunts any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III, and IV shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine. Schedule I of the Act includes animals like tigers, lions, and elephants, while Schedule II includes animals like leopards, bears, and rhinoceroses.

Section 51 of the Act deals with the penalty for contravention of any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder. It states that whoever contravenes any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine.

In the present case, Sahu was arrested in connection with a case registered under Sections 9 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The exact nature of the offence committed by Sahu is not clear from the court order. However, it can be inferred that Sahu was involved in some form of hunting or poaching of wild animals, which is a serious offence under the Act.

The court, while granting bail to Sahu, imposed certain stringent conditions on him. These conditions are aimed at ensuring that Sahu cooperates with the investigation and trial, and does not commit any similar offence in the future. The condition that Sahu shall mark his attendance before the concerned trial Court once a week till investigation is over is also significant, as it ensures that Sahu does not abscond or tamper with evidence.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a bail application filed by Prakash Sahu under Section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Sahu was arrested in connection with a case registered under Sections 9 and 51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.
