In September 2012, the Punjab and Haryana High Court passed an order in a writ petition filed by Manisha Mahajan against the State of Punjab and others. The petitioner had alleged that the respondents had violated directions issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the High Court. The court, however, ruled that a writ cannot be entertained to enforce directions that have already been issued.

The order was passed by Hon'ble Mr. Justice Jasbir Singh, Acting Chief Justice and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain. The court allowed the petitioner to withdraw the writ petition with liberty to avail of proper remedy. The order essentially means that the petitioner can approach the appropriate forum to seek redressal for the alleged violations.

The court's ruling is significant as it underscores the importance of following directions issued by higher courts. It also highlights the need for individuals to approach the appropriate forum to seek redressal for grievances, rather than filing writ petitions that may not be entertained.

The order also serves as a reminder to government authorities and other respondents to comply with court directions. Failure to do so can result in legal action being taken against them, as was the case in this instance.

Overall, the court's order in this case reinforces the importance of following court directions and seeking redressal through appropriate channels. It also serves as a warning to those who may be tempted to flout court orders that they do so at their own peril.
