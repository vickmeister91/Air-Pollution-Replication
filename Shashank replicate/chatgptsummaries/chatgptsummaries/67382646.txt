The National Green Tribunal in Chennai recently heard an appeal by Janajagrithi Samithi and others against the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and Udupi Power Corporation Limited. The appellants argued that the Board had granted consent to the power plant without considering the damage already caused and not providing mitigating measures to control or prevent pollution to air and water. The Appellate Authority had dismissed the appeal, but the appellants argued that they were aggrieved persons and competent to prefer an appeal under the Air and Water Acts. The respondents argued that only the person who sought consent from the Board could appeal. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous rulings before making a judgement.

The court order discusses the maintainability of an appeal against a consent order granted by the State Board under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court rejects the argument that only the proponent who sought the consent order can appeal and holds that any person aggrieved by the order can appeal. The court cites previous rulings and provisions of the Acts to support its decision. The court also notes that complainants or objectors can be considered aggrieved persons. The court concludes that the appellants in the case are indeed aggrieved persons and are entitled to an opportunity to present their grievances.

The court order states that the appellants had submitted objections and representations regarding violations and deficiencies noted by inspecting authorities. The court acknowledges that the appellants are aggrieved persons and have the right to ventilate their grievances. The court also notes that the phrase "aggrieved person" includes the appellants, who are original complainants and objectors, and they can maintain appeals under the appeal provision of the respective enactments. The court further states that any person who is really aggrieved should be allowed to agitate their grievance in order to get protection and also for the improvement of the environment. The court allows the appeal and remands the matter to the Appellate Authority with directions to take the appeals on file, enquire and pass suitable order on merits and in accordance with law.
