The court order pertains to five different cases related to land use and development in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The first case involves two civil writ petitions that raise identical questions of law and facts. The petitioners claim to have been residing in Chandigarh for the last 20-30 years and are seeking allotment of flats under the Chandigarh Small Flats Scheme, 2006. The respondents argue that the petitioners have raised constructions without permission and have violated the provisions of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952. The court notes that the petitioners' argument for extension of Lal Dora has been declined in a previous case and upholds the respondents' stand.

In the second case, the court order states that the land in question cannot be developed haphazardly and must be preserved for the future growth of Chandigarh. The Act only puts reasonable restrictions on the use of the land and does not restrict the owner's use of it. The petitioners are not entitled to allotment of dwelling units meant for economically weaker sections of society. The court also defines abadi deh as the inhabited site of the village consisting of sites where the houses of the members of the brotherhood or proprietary body are usually built together. The land is held in joint ownership and is treated as the common property of the community. The court finds no merit in the writ petition.

The third case discusses various cases related to land use and development in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. It notes that certain exceptions exist under Section 15 of the Act, which do not apply to buildings for residential or agricultural purposes in the abadi area of any village. The order also cites the East Punjab Holdings Act, which defines common purposes to include the extension of village abadi. The court finds that none of the judgments deal with the right of villagers to seek extension of Lal Dora or abadi deh land.

The fourth case pertains to the reservation of land for common purposes, specifically for the extension of village abadi. The East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948 allows for the reservation of land for abadi during consolidation. The petitioners, who occupy small portions of land outside abadi, have no right to demand extension of abadi as it is a common purpose for which land can only be reserved in the manner prescribed under the statute. The court also notes that haphazard growth over private land is not contemplated for planned cities like Chandigarh. The court cites a previous case where the administration argued against extending Lal Dora, stating that it would be counterproductive and lead to unauthorized construction. The court found that an administrative decision taken for a good cause does not call for interference in the public interest.

The fifth case dismisses a public interest litigation petition regarding the extension of abadi area in Punjab and Chandigarh. The court states that the extension can only be ordered during consolidation and is a matter of policy, not a right. The court also notes that the Chandigarh Small Flats Scheme does not apply to private landowners and dismisses the petition.

In summary, the court order deals with various cases related to land use and development in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The court upholds the respondents' stand in the first case, stating that the petitioners have violated the provisions of the Punjab New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952. In the second case, the court notes that the land in question cannot be developed haphazardly and must be preserved for the future growth of Chandigarh. The court defines abadi deh as the inhabited site of the village consisting of sites where the houses of the members of the brotherhood or proprietary body are usually built together.
