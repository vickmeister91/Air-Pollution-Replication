The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/S Tata Mines and Minerals against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had sought a direction from the court to expedite the issuance of a notification granting a mining lease over an area of 11.74 hectares of land in Bellary district. The Central Government had already granted approval for the lease in 2010, but the notification had not been issued by the State Government.

The court directed the Secretary (Mines) to issue the notification within six weeks and the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the petitioner's application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court did not award any costs to either party.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the Central Government had already granted approval for the mining lease in 2010, and the delay in issuing the notification by the State Government was causing undue hardship to the petitioner. The court noted that the delay was also causing a loss of revenue to the State Government, as the petitioner had already paid the necessary fees and royalties for the lease.

The court's order is significant as it highlights the importance of timely issuance of notifications by the State Government. The delay in this case had caused significant financial losses to the petitioner and the State Government, and the court's decision will help to prevent similar delays in the future.

The court's direction to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests to consider the petitioner's application for approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 is also significant. The Act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes must be approved by the Central Government or the State Government, depending on the size of the area to be diverted. In this case, the petitioner had applied for approval under the Act, but the application had not been considered by the State Government. The court's direction will ensure that the application is considered in a timely manner, and that the necessary approvals are obtained before the mining lease is granted.

Overall, the court's order is a positive development for the mining industry in Karnataka, as it will help to streamline the process of granting mining leases and ensure that the necessary approvals are obtained in a timely manner. It is also a reminder to the State Government of the importance of timely issuance of notifications and the need to comply with the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.
