In the case of M/S. Fireball Securities & Consultants v. O.P. Rawat, the plaintiff was employed with the defendant company and sustained injuries while on duty. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant did not fulfill its obligations in terms of reimbursement of medical expenses and salary payments. The trial court passed a decree in favor of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 62,900/- and rejected the defendant's counter-claim. The defendant filed an appeal challenging the decree passed in favor of the plaintiff.

The appeal was heard by the court, which upheld the decree for compensation for pain and suffering and medical expenses but modified the decree for salary payments. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to receive a salary of Rs. 20,912 for July and August 2003, but not for September 2003. The court also dismissed the plaintiff's claim for compensation for permanent injury.

The court order stated that the plaintiff was absent from work without authorization, but the defendant did not inform the plaintiff until September 2003. Therefore, the defendant was not justified in invoking clause 8 of the appointment letter to deny the plaintiff's salary for July and August 2003. However, since the plaintiff did not resume work after receiving the notice in September 2003, the defendant was entitled to invoke clause 8 and terminate the plaintiff's services.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the appointment letter and the evidence presented by both parties. The court found that the defendant was not justified in denying the plaintiff's salary for July and August 2003, as the plaintiff was not informed of the absence until September 2003. However, the court also found that the plaintiff did not resume work after receiving the notice in September 2003, which entitled the defendant to terminate the plaintiff's services.

The court also considered the plaintiff's claim for compensation for permanent injury. The plaintiff claimed that the injury sustained while on duty had resulted in permanent disability and loss of earning capacity. However, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the claim for permanent injury and dismissed the claim.

In conclusion, the court upheld the decree for compensation for pain and suffering and medical expenses but modified the decree for salary payments. The plaintiff was entitled to receive a salary of Rs. 20,912 for July and August 2003, but not for September 2003. The court also dismissed the plaintiff's claim for compensation for permanent injury. The court's decision was based on the interpretation of the appointment letter and the evidence presented by both parties.
