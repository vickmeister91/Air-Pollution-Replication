The case in question involves a petitioner named Sri Santhosh Kumar, who filed a Criminal Petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. seeking release on bail in C.C. No.87/11. The petitioner was accused of issuing a NOC for construction on a property located in a reservation forest area. The forest officials had informed the concerned authorities not to accord any sanction of license, and when the petitioner was informed, he cancelled the NOC. 

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the case was registered against the petitioner much prior to the issue of the NOC. The court also noted that the petitioner had cancelled the NOC when he was informed of the forest officials' objections. Based on these findings, the court determined that the case was not a fit case for quashing the proceedings and dismissed the petition.

The petitioner's argument for release on bail was based on the fact that he had cancelled the NOC when he was informed of the forest officials' objections. However, the court found that this did not absolve him of the charges against him. The court also noted that the case had been registered against the petitioner prior to the issue of the NOC, indicating that the petitioner may have been aware of the illegality of his actions.

The court's decision to dismiss the petition highlights the importance of following proper procedures and regulations when dealing with forest areas and other protected lands. The forest officials' objections to the construction in the reservation forest area were based on the need to protect the environment and preserve the natural resources of the area. By issuing the NOC despite these objections, the petitioner may have put the environment and the natural resources of the area at risk.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of accountability and responsibility in public service. As a public official, the petitioner had a duty to uphold the law and protect the environment. By issuing the NOC despite the objections of the forest officials, the petitioner may have violated this duty and put the environment and the natural resources of the area at risk.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the petitioner's Criminal Petition highlights the importance of following proper procedures and regulations when dealing with protected lands and the environment. It also underscores the importance of accountability and responsibility in public service. As public officials, it is our duty to uphold the law and protect the environment for the benefit of present and future generations.
