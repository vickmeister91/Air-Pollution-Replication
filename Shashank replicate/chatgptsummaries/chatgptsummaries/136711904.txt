The Tamilnadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO) has filed a writ petition challenging an office memorandum issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The memorandum directed TANGEDCO to comply with the Fly Ash Utilisation Amendment Notification. TANGEDCO argues that their right to collect service charges, to recover the expenditure incurred in collecting and supplying fly ash, is based on the principle of quid pro quo. They also argue that there was no violation of the notification issued by the Ministry.

The third respondent, an Association of manufacturers of fly ash, bricks and blocks, argues that TANGEDCO is bound by the statutory notifications issued by the Ministry, in exercise of the powers conferred by the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The court order discusses the conflict between the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Electricity Act, 2003.

The court concludes that while the Ministry of Environment and Forests has the power to issue directions to all polluting industries, any directive that infringes upon the property rights of the generating companies is inconsistent with the Electricity Act, 2003. The court sets aside the impugned order and states that the respondents have not considered the impact of the Electricity Act, 2003 upon the Notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

The case revolves around the issue of fly ash utilization. Fly ash is a byproduct of coal combustion and is a major environmental concern due to its potential to contaminate soil and water. The Ministry of Environment and Forests issued a notification in 1999, which was amended in 2003, to regulate the utilization of fly ash. The notification requires all thermal power plants to ensure that at least 25% of the fly ash generated is used in the manufacture of bricks, blocks, and other construction materials.

TANGEDCO is a state-owned power generation and distribution company in Tamil Nadu. They generate electricity by burning coal and produce a significant amount of fly ash. TANGEDCO collects and supplies fly ash to manufacturers of bricks, blocks, and other construction materials. They charge a service fee for this service, which they argue is based on the principle of quid pro quo.

The Association of manufacturers of fly ash, bricks and blocks argues that TANGEDCO is bound by the statutory notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. They argue that TANGEDCO is required to comply with the notification and cannot charge a service fee for the collection and supply of fly ash.

The court order discusses the conflict between the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Electricity Act, 2003. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 gives the Ministry of Environment and Forests the power to issue directions to all polluting industries. The Electricity Act, 2003 regulates the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in India.

The court concludes that while the Ministry of Environment and Forests has the power to issue directions to all polluting industries, any directive that infringes upon the property rights of the generating companies is inconsistent with the Electricity Act, 2003. The court notes that TANGEDCO has a right to recover the expenditure incurred in collecting and supplying fly ash. The court sets aside the impugned order and states that the respondents have not considered the impact of the Electricity Act, 2003 upon the Notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests.

In conclusion, the court order provides clarity on the conflict between the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Electricity Act, 2003. The court recognizes the importance of fly ash utilization in reducing environmental pollution. However, the court also recognizes the property rights of the generating companies and their right to recover the expenditure incurred in collecting and supplying fly ash. The court's decision sets a precedent for future cases involving the conflict between environmental regulations and property rights.
