The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by an individual named Bachhu under section 439 of the Cr.P.C. Bachhu was accused of offences punishable under sections 27, 29, 50, 51 and 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act and 41, 52 of the Indian Forest Act. Specifically, Bachhu was accused of illegal transportation of Chambal Sand.

The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, allowed the bail application filed by Bachhu. The court directed Bachhu to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent and local sureties of Rs. 50,000 each. This means that Bachhu would have to provide a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 as a guarantee that he would appear in court when required. Additionally, two other individuals would have to provide guarantees of Rs. 50,000 each, indicating that they would be responsible for ensuring that Bachhu appears in court.

The court also imposed certain conditions on Bachhu, which he would have to comply with in order to ensure that the bail order remains effective. These conditions include:

1. Bachhu must not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission.

2. Bachhu must not tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses in the case.

3. Bachhu must cooperate with the investigating agency and appear before them whenever required.

4. Bachhu must attend all court hearings and proceedings.

If Bachhu fails to comply with any of these conditions, the bail order would become ineffective, and he would be liable to be taken into custody.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail to Bachhu does not mean that he has been acquitted of the charges against him. The trial will continue, and Bachhu will have to defend himself against the charges in court. However, the court has deemed it fit to grant him bail, indicating that it does not consider him to be a flight risk or a danger to society.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bachhu, who was accused of illegal transportation of Chambal Sand. The court allowed the bail application and directed Bachhu to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000 with two solvent and local sureties of Rs. 50,000 each.
