The court order in question pertains to a fatal accident case where the parents of the deceased filed a suit under the Fatal Accident Act, 1855, and were awarded compensation by the trial court. The appeal filed by the appellants, who were held responsible for the accident, was dismissed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh.

The case involved the death of a young boy who was electrocuted while playing near a pole belonging to the electricity company. The parents of the deceased filed a suit under the Fatal Accident Act, 1855, seeking compensation for the loss of their son. The trial court found the appellants, who were responsible for the accident, liable and awarded compensation to the parents.

The appellants filed an appeal against the decision of the trial court, arguing that the electricity company should be held liable for the accident as well. They contended that the company had failed to maintain the wires and poles in a safe condition, which had led to the accident.

The High Court of Madhya Pradesh dismissed the appeal, holding that the principle of strict liability can be invoked to hold the electricity company liable not only when electrocution occurs on coming in direct contact with electric wire belonging to the Company but also when electrocution takes place on coming in contact with wires used for pilfering electric energy from the wires/poles belonging to the Company. The court stated that the electricity company had a duty to ensure that its wires and poles were safe and that it had failed to discharge this duty in the present case.

The court also held that the judgment of the trial court was in accordance with the law and cannot be held to be perverse or unlawful in any manner. The dismissal of the appeal will not come in the way of the plaintiffs seeking enhancement of compensation amount before the appropriate forum.

This court order is significant as it clarifies the principle of strict liability in cases involving electrocution. It establishes that the electricity company can be held liable not only for accidents that occur due to its own wires and poles but also for accidents that occur due to wires used for pilfering electric energy from its wires and poles. This decision is likely to have far-reaching implications for the electricity industry, as it will require companies to take greater care in maintaining their infrastructure and ensuring the safety of the public.

Furthermore, the court's decision to uphold the judgment of the trial court and dismiss the appeal is a reminder of the importance of following due process and respecting the decisions of lower courts. It reinforces the principle that judgments should be based on the law and the facts of the case, rather than on personal biases or interests.

Overall, this court order serves as an important precedent for future cases involving electrocution and strict liability. It highlights the need for companies to prioritize safety and take responsibility for the consequences of their actions, and it underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law and respecting the decisions of the judiciary.
