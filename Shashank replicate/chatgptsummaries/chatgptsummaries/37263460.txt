The High Court recently passed an order in two criminal petitions filed by Mr. Satish B. Sharma and M/S Balaji Enterprises against Kutch Digital Zone. The petitions were filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, seeking to set aside an order passed by the trial court dismissing their application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The application sought production of certain documents from the complainant in two criminal cases.

The trial court had dismissed the application on the grounds that the accused had filed several applications before the court and that the documents sought were not necessary for the defense of the accused. However, the High Court allowed the petitions and directed the complainant to produce the documents sought by the accused. The accused were also directed to pay a cost of Rs. 2,000/- in each of the cases to the complainant.
