The court order pertains to a case where an applicant, who was working as Regional Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Kolkata, applied for the post of Member (Technical), Company Law Board (CLB). The applicant received an offer of appointment as Member (Technical) in the CLB, but his request to keep his lien on the existing post was rejected. The applicant did not seek voluntary retirement nor gave his unqualified acceptance for the post of Member (Technical) CLB, but continued to make repeated representations. The respondents ultimately cancelled the appointment of the applicant as Member (Technical), CLB and debarred him for 03 years for consideration for appointment in all autonomous/statutory bodies.

The court had to decide whether the Central Administrative Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the matter. The court held that the CLB, which functions independently as a statutorily constituted Tribunal while exercising quasi-judicial functions cannot be said to be a department of the Government but is a statutory Board, which performs quasi-judicial functions and has power to regulate its own procedure while deciding the matters. Thus, a Member of the CLB cannot be said to be holder of a civil post under the Union.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal in relation to disputes and complaints regarding recruitment and conditions of service of personnel appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or any State or local authority within the territory of India. The Tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction over members of All India Service, persons appointed to civil service of the Union or any civil post under the Union, and civilians appointed to defense services or post connected with defense. However, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over all types of disputes of the specified personnel, only those related to recruitment and service matters.

The Tribunal's jurisdiction can be extended to include personnel appointed to any service or post in connection with the affairs of any local or other authority or corporation if provisions of Section 14 (3) of the A.T. Act are applied by the Central Government. In this case, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the matter as no notification has been issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 14 (2) of the A.T. Act, 1985 in respect of the Board of Company Law Administration. The present OA is not maintainable, and the applicant may take recourse to the appropriate forum to agitate his grievances.

In summary, the court order deals with the jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal in relation to disputes and complaints regarding recruitment and conditions of service of personnel appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or any State or local authority within the territory of India. The court held that the CLB, which functions independently as a statutorily constituted Tribunal while exercising quasi-judicial functions cannot be said to be a department of the Government but is a statutory Board, which performs quasi-judicial functions and has power to regulate its own procedure while deciding the matters. The Tribunal's jurisdiction can be extended to include personnel appointed to any service or post in connection with the affairs of any local or other authority or corporation if provisions of Section 14 (3) of the A.T. Act are applied by the Central Government. However, in this case, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain the matter as no notification has been issued by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section 14 (2) of the A.T. Act, 1985 in respect of the Board of Company Law Administration.
