Dr. Sathish Rajashekarayya, a concerned citizen, filed a writ petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, seeking the intervention of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in addressing the issue of persistent pollution in his locality. The petitioner had previously approached the Regional Officer, who had conducted an inquiry into the matter and submitted a report to the KSPCB. However, no action had been taken by the KSPCB in response to the report.

The petitioner argued that the KSPCB had a statutory duty to take appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution, and that its failure to act in this case was a violation of his fundamental right to a clean environment. He requested the court to direct the KSPCB to act on the outcome of the inquiry held by the Regional Officer and take necessary steps to address the pollution in his locality.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, observed that the petitioner had not provided any material or data to support his claim of persistent pollution in the subsequent period. The court noted that the report submitted by the Regional Officer was based on a one-time inspection and did not establish the existence of persistent pollution. Therefore, the court ordered the petitioner to collect necessary material and data for making a complaint before the Pollution Control Board if there is persistent pollution in the subsequent period.

The court also observed that the KSPCB had a statutory duty to take appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution, and that it was expected to act on the report submitted by the Regional Officer. However, the court did not find any evidence of non-compliance by the KSPCB in this case. Therefore, the court disposed of the petition accordingly, with no order as to cost.

This court order highlights the importance of providing sufficient evidence to support claims of environmental pollution. While the court acknowledged the petitioner's concern for the environment, it emphasized the need for concrete evidence to establish the existence of persistent pollution. The court also reiterated the statutory duty of the KSPCB to take appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution, and the expectation that it would act on the report submitted by the Regional Officer.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the role of citizens in protecting the environment and the responsibility of government agencies in enforcing environmental laws. It also emphasizes the need for evidence-based decision-making in environmental matters.
