Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala had filed a criminal revision against the judgment passed in Crl.M.P.No.3027 of 2006, in C.C.No.2825 of 2004, on the file of the XVIIth Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai dated 21.11.2007. The case was filed against the petitioner and two others under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had filed a petition stating that he is an innocent person and someone has dragged him into the case by way of forging his signature in the alleged said cheque which has not been duly signed by him on behalf of the 1st accused namely, M/s.Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The Magistrate had dismissed the petition, and the 3rd accused had filed a revision. The court had declined to set aside the trial court order, and the revision was dismissed.

The case in question was filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which deals with dishonour of cheques. The petitioner, Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala, had been accused along with two others of dishonouring a cheque issued on behalf of M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The petitioner had claimed that he was innocent and that his signature had been forged on the cheque. He had filed a petition to this effect, but the Magistrate had dismissed it.

The petitioner had then filed a criminal revision against the Magistrate's order. The revision had been filed on the grounds that the Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petitioner's petition without considering the evidence presented by him. The petitioner had claimed that he had not signed the cheque in question and that his signature had been forged. He had also claimed that he had no connection with M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited and that he had been falsely implicated in the case.

The court had considered the petitioner's arguments and had declined to set aside the trial court order. The court had noted that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to support his claim that his signature had been forged. The court had also noted that the petitioner had not denied his association with M/s. Merlin Leasing and Investment Private Limited. The court had therefore concluded that the petitioner had failed to prove his innocence and had upheld the trial court's order.

The case highlights the importance of producing evidence in court to support one's claims. In this case, the petitioner had claimed that his signature had been forged, but had failed to produce any evidence to support this claim. The court had therefore been unable to accept his argument and had upheld the trial court's order. It is important for litigants to understand the importance of evidence in court and to ensure that they have sufficient evidence to support their claims.

In conclusion, the court had declined to set aside the trial court order in the case of Dr. Feroze S. Dhanaliwala, who had been accused of dishonouring a cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had claimed that he was innocent and that his signature had been forged, but had failed to produce any evidence to support this claim. The court had therefore upheld the trial court's order and had dismissed the petitioner's criminal revision. The case highlights the importance of producing evidence in court to support one's claims and the need for litigants to understand the importance of evidence in court.
