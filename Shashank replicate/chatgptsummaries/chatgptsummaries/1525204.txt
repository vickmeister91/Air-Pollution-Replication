In 1999, the Gujarat High Court issued a court order based on a report by a committee that found 289 out of 387 industrial units surveyed were operating without authorized drainage and/or outlet or without a trade license. The court ordered the closure of these units and directed the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the Municipal Commissioner to ensure compliance. The court later modified the order to allow certain units to operate on a trial basis for three months, subject to certain conditions. The court also directed the units to apply for necessary permits and to treat their effluent before discharge. The court gave several opportunities for compliance and warned of closure for non-compliance.

The court order emphasizes the importance of compliance with the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Environment (Protection) Act, which aim to prevent contamination of water and protect the environment. The State Board has the power to grant or refuse consent for discharge of pollutants, and there are provisions for appeal and revision. The court cannot monitor the granting of consent, which is the exclusive statutory function of the Board. The court also clarifies that trade licenses and consents cannot be waived, and the authorities must take action against violators.

The court order also discusses the obligations of the Municipal Corporation and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The Municipal Corporation has an obligatory duty to provide for the construction, maintenance, and cleansing of drains and drainage work. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board is responsible for granting or refusing consent for establishing any industry, operation, or process that is likely to discharge sewage or trade effluent. The court cannot issue directions that contravene the provisions of the law.

The court ordered the closure of 39 industrial units that had not obtained necessary licenses and consents under the Water Act and the BPMC Act. The Municipal Corporation and the GPCB were directed to file affidavits stating their actions taken and proposed time-bound action plans. The units were carrying out trade operations without health permits and discharging trade effluent without complying with statutory provisions.

The court issues directions for the authorities to take expeditious decisions on pending applications and to treat all units equally, regardless of membership in any association. The court emphasizes that its jurisdiction is limited to issuing appropriate writs or orders for the enforcement of fundamental rights or to set aside illegal orders or actions of authorities.

The court order states that the concerned authorities should follow the Municipal law, Pollution Control laws, and other applicable laws while considering applications for clearance. The authorities should take their own decisions without waiting for any orders from the court. The pending applications should be decided within one month. The petition is disposed of with no order as to costs.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and the responsibilities of the Municipal Corporation and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board in ensuring compliance. The court also emphasizes the limited jurisdiction of the court in issuing appropriate writs or orders for the enforcement of fundamental rights or to set aside illegal orders or actions of authorities. The court order serves as a reminder to all industrial units to obtain necessary licenses and consents and to comply with statutory provisions to prevent contamination of water and protect the environment.
