The court order pertains to two civil writ jurisdiction cases filed by M/s Bhagwati Timber and M/s Wasif Plywood Works against the State of Bihar and other forest authorities. The petitioners sought to quash the final seniority list of Veneer Mills and Plywood Industries and prepare a fresh list in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Central Empowered Committee and the State. The court heard both cases together and disposed of them with a common judgment.

The court reviewed the history of the petitioners' businesses and their compliance with various regulations and granted relief in favor of the petitioners. The court order discusses the establishment of a Veneer Mill by the petitioner and the various licenses and registrations obtained by them under different acts and regulations. The petitioner had applied for and obtained licenses under the Prime Minister Rojgar Scheme, the Factories Act, the Central Sales Tax Act, and the Bihar Saw Mills (Regulation) Act, among others. The court notes that the petitioner had been operating the Veneer Mill since 1996 and had been regularly filing returns and paying taxes. The court order confirms the legality of the petitioner's operations and dismisses any claims to the contrary.

The court order discusses the establishment of Veneer Mills and Plywood Industries in Bihar and the government's decision to fix the number of such industries based on the sustainable capacity of the forests. The government constituted an Expert Committee to assess the capacity of the forests and recommended the closure of unlicensed Saw Mills. The government also amended the Saw Mill (Regulation) Act to include Veneer and Plywood manufacturing units. The order mentions the existence of the Petitioner Veneer Mill before the cut-off date of 12.12.1996 and its registration with the Commercial Tax Department. The government published lists of existing Plywood and Veneer Mills in various districts of Bihar. The court dismissed writ petitions filed against the government's resolution on issuing licenses and shutting down excess Saw Mills.

The court order states that veneer mills and plywood manufacturing units established before 12.12.1996 can continue to operate if they submit an application for a license. Those established after that date must be closed down immediately. The state government has issued detailed guidelines for the closure of wood-based industries and the preparation of a seniority list. The seniority list will be based on the date of establishment, and licenses issued by the Industries Department and Factory License will be considered. Only veneer mills established before 29.10.2002 will be taken into account for the preparation of the seniority list.

The court order discusses the determination of seniority for Veneer Mills/Plywood Industries in the state of Bihar. The date of establishment is to be determined based on various factors such as the date of registration, purchase/lease of land, electric connection, purchase of relevant machines, start of commercial production, sales tax registration, and sales tax paid. The date of production is to be considered as the date of establishment if the unit started production much later than the date of registration. The Central Empowered Committee's recommendations should be followed while preparing the seniority list. The petitioners have challenged the seniority list on the grounds of arbitrary placement of certain mills and not considering the date of production for their own units.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the seniority list of Veneer Mills/Plywood Industries in the state of Bihar. The petitioners argue that the list was prepared without any standard yardstick and in contravention of guidelines set forth by the Central Empowered Committee and the government of Bihar. They claim that the final seniority list is full of defects and anomalies and should be quashed. The respondents argue that the list was prepared in accordance with the recommendations of the Central Empowered Committee and the government of Bihar, and that objections were invited and verified before the final list was published. The court is considering the arguments of both sides.

The court order discusses the preparation and publication of seniority lists for Veneer Mills and Plywood pasting units in the state of Bihar. The Central Empowered Committee's guidelines for determining the date of establishment of a unit were adopted, but the petitioners allege that the seniority lists were prepared in an arbitrary manner without following these guidelines. The court finds that the respondents have not provided justifiable reasons for the allegations made by the petitioners and that certain units were placed in the seniority list in an arbitrary manner. The court orders a review of the seniority list preparation process.

The court has ruled that the seniority list of Veneer Mills/Plywood Industries published in 2013 is not in accordance with the law and is therefore quashed. The authorities are ordered to consider the case of the petitioners and the mentioned industries after following the recommendation of the Central Empowered Committee and the order of the Supreme Court in a transparent and legal manner while preparing a fresh seniority list. The court has allowed both writ applications and ordered that status quo with respect to seniority be maintained until a final seniority list is prepared afresh by the authorities after considering the case of each unit along with the petitioners on merit. The authorities are given nine months to prepare a fresh seniority list. The petitioners are ordered to file a separate representation before the authorities along with relevant documents and a copy of the judgment.

In summary, the court order pertains to two civil writ jurisdiction cases filed
