The Customs, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Mumbai recently heard several appeals against orders passed by the Commissioner of Central Excise in Nagpur. The cases involved disputes over the admissibility of CENVAT credit for capital goods received by the appellants, as well as penalties imposed for violations of CEVAT Credit Rules and the Central Excise Act.

In one case, the appellant, M/S. Indorama Synthetics (I) Ltd., had been disallowed credit on certain items declared as capital goods by the Commissioner of Central Excise in Nagpur. The Commissioner had demanded a penalty of Rs. 3,63,05,053/- and Rs. 3,97,70,821/- respectively, and the Tribunal upheld the Commissioner's decision and dismissed the appeals.

In another case, the court examined various agreements and documents related to the setting up of a TPP and found that the second party had leased premises from the appellant and had capitalized the TPP in their books of accounts. The court concluded that the premises were legally not part of the appellant's premises. The court also found that the demand for the credit taken during a certain period was time-barred and that penalties could not be imposed.

In yet another case, the court determined that the leased premises were not part of the appellant's factory and that the second party was a separate legal entity with its own liabilities and duties. The court also cited legal provisions and previous court decisions to support its ruling that the appellant was not entitled to the claimed CENVAT credit. The court considered several issues related to the ownership and operation of the thermal power plant on the leased premises and ultimately concluded that the appellant was not entitled to the claimed credit and was liable for interest and penalty.

The court also discussed the implementation of a Thermal Power Plant by a company called Indo Rama Petrochemicals Ltd. The expenses towards the procurement of goods for the plant were incurred by the company and not on the account of the appellants. The mention of consignee as "M/s Indo Rama Synthetics Limited" on invoices was an attempt to create entitlement to CENVAT Credit for the appellants without passing the actual ownership or right to use the goods in their favor. The court concludes that the 2nd party was constructing, installing, owning, operating, and maintaining the Thermal Power Plant as its own business asset for generating profits for itself by way of sale of power, and the appellants had no role or authority over the 2nd party.

In another case, the court found that the appellant had no role or authority over the power plant and did not receive the goods covered by the invoices on which they were shown as consignee. Therefore, the credit was not admissible to them. The court also discussed the provisions of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 and found that credit on capital goods can only be availed if the same are received in the factory of the manufacturer of final product and used in the factory of manufacture.

In a case involving M/s. JSWPL, the court relied on previous case laws to determine that the appellants are entitled to Cenvat credit on the capital goods used for manufacturing 'CPP' by M/s. JSWPL, which is being used by the appellants to manufacture their final product, iron and steel. The court also distinguishes this case from previous cases where the premises were leased out to another company.

In another case, the court found that the Tribunal had allowed the appeal of the assessee-company without proper appreciation of the transactions in the light of relevant provisions of the Central Excise Act and the Rules. The court also held that ownership of the capital goods is not relevant for determining eligibility for CENVAT credit, but receipt and usage are. The court further discussed the admissibility of credit in respect of goods that are not identifiable and classified under Chapter 84 of the First Schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985.

In yet another case, the court upheld the penalties imposed under Rule 15 of CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004 read with Section 11AC of Central Excise Act, 1944. The court partially allowed the appeal and remanded the matter to determine the quantum of inadmissible credit post-merger of the 2nd party and appellant.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of complying with CEVAT Credit Rules and the Central Excise Act when claiming CENVAT credit for capital goods. The court emphasized that ownership of the capital goods is not relevant for determining eligibility for CENVAT credit, but receipt and usage are. The court also examined various agreements and documents related to the setting up of thermal power plants and found that leased premises were not part of the appellant's factory and that the second party was a separate legal entity with its own liabilities and duties. The court also distinguished cases where premises were leased out to another company.
