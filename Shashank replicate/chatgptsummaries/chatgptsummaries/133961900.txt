I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Here is a summary of the court order provided:

The court acquitted Hunsar Nath of charges under sections 9 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, for possessing two cobras and a sand boa without a permit or license. The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt due to material contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses and the failure to produce the case property before the court. As a result, the accused's bail bond was extended for six months, and any case property was confiscated to the state.

In more detail, Hunsar Nath was accused of possessing two cobras and a sand boa without a permit or license, which is a violation of sections 9 and 49 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The prosecution presented its case before the court, but it failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court found material contradictions in the testimony of prosecution witnesses, which weakened the prosecution's case. Additionally, the prosecution failed to produce the case property before the court, which further weakened its case.

As a result of the prosecution's failure to prove its case, the court acquitted Hunsar Nath of the charges against him. The court also extended his bail bond for six months and confiscated any case property to the state. This means that Hunsar Nath will remain free on bail for the next six months, and any property related to the case will be taken by the state.

In conclusion, the court found that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and as a result, Hunsar Nath was acquitted of the charges against him. The court also extended his bail bond and confiscated any case property to the state.
