The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by N.L. Mallikarjuna against Miss Nagini. The petitioner had filed a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (N.I. Act) for dishonour of a cheque issued by the respondent. The petitioner had sought an opportunity to recall PW1 (Prosecution Witness 1) for the purpose of production of passbook relating to his account in proof of the debit of the cheque amount to the bank account of the complainant. However, the learned Magistrate had rejected this application.

The petitioner then approached the higher court, which found fault with the reasoning assigned by the learned Magistrate and allowed the petition. The impugned order was set aside, and the application filed by the petitioner under Section 311 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) stands allowed. The trial court was directed to fix a date for examination of PW1 and proceed in accordance with the law.

Section 138 of the N.I. Act deals with the offence of dishonour of cheques for insufficiency of funds in the account of the drawer. The provision makes it a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. The provision has been enacted to ensure the credibility of cheques as a mode of payment and to promote the efficacy of banking operations.

In the present case, the petitioner had alleged that the respondent had issued a cheque in his favour, which was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds in the account of the respondent. The petitioner had then sent a legal notice to the respondent demanding payment of the cheque amount, but the respondent had failed to make the payment within the stipulated time. Hence, the petitioner had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.

During the trial, PW1 had deposed that he had received the cheque from the respondent and had deposited it in the bank. However, the petitioner had contended that the cheque had not been debited to his account, and hence, he had sought an opportunity to recall PW1 for the purpose of production of passbook relating to his account in proof of the debit of the cheque amount to the bank account of the complainant.

The learned Magistrate had rejected this application on the ground that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the passbook was not available earlier. The learned Magistrate had also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the passbook earlier and had only made the application at a later stage of the trial.

However, the higher court found fault with this reasoning and held that the petitioner had a right to recall PW1 for the purpose of production of passbook, which was relevant to the case. The court observed that the passbook was a document that could be produced at any stage of the trial, and the petitioner had not been given a fair opportunity to prove his case.

The court also noted that the petitioner had made the application for recall of PW1 at the earliest opportunity, and there was no delay on his part. The court held that the learned Magistrate had erred in rejecting the application and directed the trial court to fix a date for examination of PW1 and proceed in accordance with the law.

The court order is significant as it upholds the right of the petitioner to recall a witness for the purpose of production of relevant evidence. The order also emphasizes the importance of fair trial and the need to ensure that both parties are given a fair opportunity to prove their case. The order also highlights the role of the higher courts in correcting errors committed by the lower courts and ensuring that justice is done.
