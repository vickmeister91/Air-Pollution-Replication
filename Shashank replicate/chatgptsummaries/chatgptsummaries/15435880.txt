The court has rejected the plaintiff's claim for permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendants who had demolished a partition wall on the second floor of a property in New Delhi. The court found that the demolition had been carried out by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) after due process of law, and that any grievance against the demolition orders should be addressed to the Ld. Appellate Tribunal of MCD, not the civil court. The court cited Section 343(4) and Section 347(E) of the DMC Act, which bar courts from entertaining suits or applications against the Commissioner to restrain him from taking any action or making any order in pursuance of the provisions of this section.

The court order further states that no court can entertain any suit or application in respect of any order or notice appealable under section 343 or section 347B of the Delhi Municipal Corporation (Amendment) Act, 1984. The court also states that it has no jurisdiction to entertain a suit against orders of demolition passed by the competent authority of MCD. The plaintiff's suit is barred under Section 347 (E) read with Sections 347 (B) and 343 (4) of DMC Act, 1957, and U/s 41(h) of Specific Relief Act. The court allows the application and rejects the plaint. No order as to costs is given.
