In a recent criminal petition, the petitioner sought to set aside an order rejecting their application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The trial court had rejected the application on the grounds that it did not provide sufficient details about the requested documents. The petitioner had argued that the documents were necessary for the proper conduct of the trial.

However, the trial court had found that the application was vague and lacked specificity. The court had also noted that the petitioner had not provided any reasons for why the documents were necessary for the trial. As a result, the court had rejected the application.

The petitioner had then appealed to the High Court, arguing that the trial court had erred in rejecting the application. The High Court, however, upheld the trial court's decision. The court noted that the application was indeed vague and lacked specificity. The court also found that the petitioner had not provided any reasons for why the documents were necessary for the trial.

Despite upholding the trial court's decision, the High Court did allow the petitioner to file a fresh application with more details. The court noted that the petitioner could provide more specific details about the documents they were seeking and explain why they were necessary for the trial. The court also noted that the trial court would have to consider the new application on its merits.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of providing specific and detailed information when making an application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court will not grant an application if it is vague or lacks specificity. However, if the applicant can provide specific details and explain why the documents are necessary for the trial, the court may be more likely to grant the application.
