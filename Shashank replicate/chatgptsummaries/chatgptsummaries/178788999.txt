The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Pookoya.C, the 9th accused in Crime No.15 of 2019 of the Agathi Police Station. The prosecution alleges that Pookoya.C is the registered owner of a fishing vessel that was found within the limits of the territorial waters of Agathy without any valid entry permit. The vessel was seized, and electronic gadgets like GPS equipment, echo sounder, wireless sets, etc. were found on board. The accused had also collected meat of protected species of sharks and dolphins, violating the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court allowed Pookoya.C's application for pre-arrest bail, subject to certain conditions. This decision has raised concerns among environmentalists and animal rights activists, who argue that the accused should not be granted bail given the severity of the charges against him.

The case against Pookoya.C is based on a complaint filed by the Agathi Police Station, which alleged that the accused had violated several provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The Act prohibits the hunting, killing, or capturing of any wild animal, including sharks and dolphins, without a valid permit. The Act also prohibits the possession, sale, or transport of any part of a protected animal, including its meat, skin, or bones.

The prosecution argued that Pookoya.C had violated these provisions by collecting meat of protected species of sharks and dolphins without a valid permit. The prosecution also alleged that the accused had used electronic gadgets like GPS equipment, echo sounder, wireless sets, etc. to locate and capture these animals, which is a violation of the Act.

The defense, on the other hand, argued that Pookoya.C was not present on the fishing vessel at the time of the seizure and that he had no knowledge of the illegal activities being carried out by the crew. The defense also argued that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had no criminal antecedents.

After hearing both sides, the court allowed Pookoya.C's application for pre-arrest bail, subject to certain conditions. The conditions include a requirement that the accused cooperate with the investigation, not tamper with evidence, and not leave the jurisdiction of the court without prior permission. The court also directed the accused to deposit a sum of money as a surety and to report to the police station at regular intervals.

The decision to grant bail to Pookoya.C has been criticized by environmentalists and animal rights activists, who argue that the accused should not be allowed to go free given the severity of the charges against him. They argue that the accused's actions have caused irreparable damage to the marine ecosystem and that he should be held accountable for his actions.
