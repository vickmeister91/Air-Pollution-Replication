The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) had received an application from private respondents seeking permission to establish an industry. In response, Cheruku Sathamma filed two writ petitions challenging the proposal to hold a public hearing on the matter. Sathamma argued that a pending civil suit filed by her would have a bearing on the public hearing and that the hearing should not be conducted until the civil suit was resolved.

However, the court dismissed both writ petitions, stating that the pending civil suit would not deter the public hearing. The court clarified that the public hearing would be conducted without reference to any question of title or other allied matters. The court also allowed Sathamma to participate in the public hearing.

The court's decision was based on the principle that a public hearing is an essential part of the decision-making process in matters related to the environment. The court noted that the TSPCB had a statutory duty to conduct a public hearing before granting permission for the establishment of an industry. The court also observed that the purpose of a public hearing is to provide an opportunity for the public to express their views and concerns on the proposed project.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the importance of public participation in environmental decision-making. The court's ruling ensures that the public has a say in matters that affect their environment and their lives. The court's decision also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.

The court's decision also has implications for the pending civil suit filed by Sathamma. The court's ruling clarifies that the public hearing will not be influenced by any question of title or other allied matters. This means that the public hearing will focus solely on the environmental impact of the proposed project and will not address any legal disputes related to the ownership of the land.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the writ petitions filed by Sathamma and allow the public hearing to proceed is a significant victory for public participation in environmental decision-making. The court's ruling ensures that the public has a voice in matters that affect their environment and their lives. The court's decision also highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process.
