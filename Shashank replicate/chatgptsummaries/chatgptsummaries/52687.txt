The National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) filed a writ petition seeking a writ of prohibition to prevent the Government of Karnataka and its officers from interfering with its mining operations. The company had been granted a mining lease for iron ore, which was set to expire in 1988. The company applied for renewal in 1987, but the state government did not dispose of the application. The company continued mining operations until 1992 when the state government refused to grant working permits. 

The central government granted prior approval for renewal of the mining lease subject to certain conditions, which the company fulfilled. However, the state government directed the company to stop mining operations until it obtained explicit orders from the state government. The company approached the High Court of Karnataka seeking relief. The court granted an interim order allowing the company to recommence mining operations until further orders.

The court order pertains to a case involving the renewal of a mining lease and the statutory aspects related to it. The court discusses the provisions of the Minerals Act, Minerals Rules, Conservation Act, and Conservation Rules. It is stated that an application for renewal of a mining lease must be made to the State Government at least 12 months before the lease is due to expire. The court also discusses the restrictions on the use of forest land for non-forest purposes and the need for prior approval from the Central Government.

The court observed that the company had applied for renewal of the mining lease in 1987, but the state government did not dispose of the application. The court held that the state government's failure to dispose of the application cannot be a ground for refusing to grant working permits to the company. The court also held that the state government's direction to the company to stop mining operations until it obtained explicit orders from the state government was illegal.

The court quashed an order issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forests directing the company to stop its mining operations and allowed the company to claim damages for the loss suffered due to the stoppage of mining operations. The State of Karnataka was ordered to pay costs to the company.

The court also observed that the company had obtained prior approval from the Central Government for renewal of the mining lease subject to certain conditions, which the company had fulfilled. The court held that the state government cannot refuse to grant working permits to the company on the ground that it had not obtained explicit orders from the state government.

The court further observed that the company had fulfilled the conditions imposed by the Central Government for renewal of the mining lease. The court held that the state government cannot impose additional conditions for granting working permits to the company.

The court also discussed the restrictions on the use of forest land for non-forest purposes. The court held that the company had obtained prior approval from the Central Government for use of forest land for mining purposes. The court held that the state government cannot refuse to grant working permits to the company on the ground that it had not obtained explicit orders from the state government for use of forest land.

In conclusion, the court held that the state government's direction to the company to stop mining operations until it obtained explicit orders from the state government was illegal. The court quashed the order issued by the Deputy Conservator of Forests directing the company to stop its mining operations and allowed the company to claim damages for the loss suffered due to the stoppage of mining operations. The State of Karnataka was ordered to pay costs to the company. The court also held that the state government cannot refuse to grant working permits to the company on the ground that it had not obtained explicit orders from the state government for renewal of the mining lease and use of forest land for mining purposes.
