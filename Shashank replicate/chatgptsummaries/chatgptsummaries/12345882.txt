The case in question involves a criminal misc. petition filed by the petitioners under section 482 Cr.P.C. against the order of Additional Sessions Judge (Fast Track) No.2 Head Quarter Shrimadhopur in Criminal revision No. 25/12. The accused petitioners were charged under sections 18 read with sections 54 (E) and 54 (D) of the Rajasthan Excise Act. The trial court had rejected the application moved by the petitioner for their discharge. Against the order, they preferred a revision petition but the same was rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge.

The petitioners argued that the impugned orders were final orders and therefore, they were entitled to file a revision petition against them. However, the court held that the impugned orders were not final orders but were interlocutory orders. The court further held that against interlocutory orders, revision is not maintainable.

The term "interlocutory order" refers to an order that is passed during the pendency of a case and is not a final order. Such orders are passed to regulate the proceedings of the case and to ensure that justice is done. Interlocutory orders are not final and can be modified or reversed at a later stage of the proceedings.

In the present case, the trial court had rejected the application moved by the petitioner for their discharge. This order was an interlocutory order as it did not finally dispose of the case but only regulated the proceedings. Similarly, the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge was also an interlocutory order as it did not finally dispose of the case but only regulated the proceedings.

The court relied on several precedents to support its decision that revision against interlocutory orders is not maintainable. In the case of State of Maharashtra v. Praful Desai, the Supreme Court held that "revisional jurisdiction cannot be exercised against an interlocutory order which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties." Similarly, in the case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, the Supreme Court held that "revisional jurisdiction cannot be exercised against an interlocutory order which does not finally dispose of the rights of the parties."

The court also noted that the petitioners had an alternative remedy available to them. They could challenge the impugned orders in an appeal against the final order passed by the trial court. The court held that the petitioners could not bypass the appeal process and file a revision petition against an interlocutory order.

In conclusion, the court held that the impugned orders were interlocutory orders and therefore, revision against them was not maintainable. The court also noted that the petitioners had an alternative remedy available to them and they could challenge the impugned orders in an appeal against the final order passed by the trial court. The court's decision is in line with the established legal principles that revision against interlocutory orders is not maintainable.
