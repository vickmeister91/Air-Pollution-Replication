The court order in question pertains to an appeal challenging an order passed by a single judge in an application for the grant of temporary injunction in a civil original suit for partition of properties. The order modified the ex parte ad-interim order to maintain status-quo only with respect to properties situated within the territorial limits of Jammu & Kashmir State. The appellant challenged the order on the ground that the court did not have jurisdiction to try the suit in respect of properties situated outside Jammu & Kashmir State.

The court referred to Sections 16 and 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure and held that the suit could be filed in this court only if the entire property, the subject matter of the suit, was situated within the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The court also referred to previous judgments and held that the equitable doctrine of effectiveness should be invoked to balance the conflict between the jurisdiction of the Courts in J. & K. State and those in the rest of India.

The court order further states that a suit for partition with regard to properties in the State of Jammu and Kashmir can be filed together with properties in Delhi and Jullunder, as it would be encouraging multiplicity of litigation if filed separately. The court also holds that the Courts in Jammu and Kashmir have jurisdiction to entertain and try suits for partition in respect of properties situated outside the territory of Jammu and Kashmir State, similarly as the Courts in rest of India have jurisdiction to entertain and try the suits for partition in respect of properties situated in Jammu and Kashmir State.

The court remands the question relating to the grant of temporary injunction or otherwise to the learned single Judge and directs the parties to appear before the learned single Judge on a specified date.
