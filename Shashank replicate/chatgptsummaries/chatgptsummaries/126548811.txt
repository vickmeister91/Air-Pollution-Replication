The Allahabad High Court recently heard a case involving M/s Manoj Mini Rice Mill, which has been operating in a residential area without permission from the Nagar Palika Parishad or the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The District Magistrate ordered the mill to be sealed due to air pollution caused by the mill. The petitioner claims that they have not violated any terms of their business license and that the orders passed by the Pollution Control Board were in violation of natural justice. 

The court directed the Pollution Control Board to file a counter affidavit and noted that commercial and industrial activities cannot be carried out in areas earmarked for residential purposes in the Master Plan. The Nagar Palika Parishad has no authority to act under the Essential Commodities Act, and the matter is subject to the provisions of the Control Orders. A criminal complaint under Section 245 of the U.P. Municipalities Act is still pending.

The court order discusses a case where a rice mill is being operated in a residential area without obtaining the necessary consent from the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board. The court cites various laws and regulations that require industries to obtain consent and take measures to prevent pollution. The court also notes that the principle of precautionary action should be taken to prevent harm to the environment and public health. The court finds that the industry is causing pollution and orders it to be shut down. The court also observes that the principle of natural justice does not apply in this case as the petitioner was aware of the inspection and notice and had not obtained the necessary consent.

The court order states that the petitioner's industry is causing pollution in a residential area and has not obtained consent from the U.P. Pollution Control Board. The court cites previous cases where polluting industries were relocated and compensation was given to workers. The petitioner violated regulations by running the industry in a residential area. The State is not obligated to provide help in relocating polluting industries, and the petitioner has not requested any assistance. The writ petition is dismissed.
