The first court order pertains to a civil miscellaneous second appeal against a judgment and decree made in C.M.A.No.45 of 2007. The appellants are disputing the restriction imposed under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer, Krishnagiri, recommending the issuance of patta in favor of the appellants. The learned Principal District Judge, Krishnagiri, set aside the order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer, stating that the land is a forest land and without prior permission or approval of the Central Government, the Forest Settlement Officer has no locus standi to allow the encroachers to enjoy the Survey No.168/2. The court is discussing the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882, and the power of the government to reserve forests.

The court order discusses the dispute over land that was proposed to be included within reserved forests. The Forest Settlement Officer issued an order stating that the appellants were in possession of the land and should be issued a patta. However, the respondents claimed that the order was erroneous and that the appellants had no proof of possession. The government later declared the land as forest land and issued a notification proposing to constitute the land as a reserve forest. The court found that the appellants had not challenged the notification or proclamation order and that their claim to the land was extinguished under Section 17 of the Act. The appeal was dismissed.

In the first court order, the appellants were disputing the restriction imposed under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer, Krishnagiri, recommending the issuance of patta in favor of the appellants. The learned Principal District Judge, Krishnagiri, set aside the order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer, stating that the land is a forest land and without prior permission or approval of the Central Government, the Forest Settlement Officer has no locus standi to allow the encroachers to enjoy the Survey No.168/2. The court discussed the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882, and the power of the government to reserve forests.

The Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882, provides for the reservation of forests by the government. Section 4 of the Act empowers the government to declare any land to be a reserved forest. Section 5 provides for the notification of the proposed reservation of a forest, and Section 6 provides for the constitution of a reserved forest. Section 7 provides for the management of reserved forests, and Section 8 provides for the protection of reserved forests.

In the present case, the government had issued a notification proposing to constitute the land as a reserve forest. The court found that the appellants had not challenged the notification or proclamation order and that their claim to the land was extinguished under Section 17 of the Act. Section 17 provides that any person claiming any right in or over any land comprised in a reserved forest shall be required to prove that such right was created before the date of the notification or proclamation under Section 4.

The court also discussed the power of the government to reserve forests. The court held that the power to reserve forests is an essential attribute of sovereignty, and the government has the power to reserve forests for the public good. The court further held that the power to reserve forests is not limited by any other law, and the government has the power to reserve forests even if the land is privately owned.

In the second court order, the dispute was over land that was proposed to be included within reserved forests.

However, the respondents claimed that the order was erroneous and that the appellants had no proof of possession. The government later declared the land as forest land and issued a notification proposing to constitute the land as a reserve forest.

The court found that the appellants had not challenged the notification or proclamation order and that their claim to the land was extinguished under Section 17 of the Act. The court held that the notification or proclamation under Section 4 of the Act is a public document, and any person claiming any right in or over any land comprised in a reserved forest shall be deemed to have notice of the notification or proclamation.

The court further held that the Forest Settlement Officer has no power to allow the encroachers to enjoy the land without the prior permission or approval of the Central Government. The court held that the Forest Settlement Officer has no locus standi to allow the encroachers to enjoy the land, and any order passed by the Forest Settlement Officer without the prior permission or approval of the Central Government is void.

In conclusion, both court orders pertain to disputes over land that was proposed to be included within reserved forests. The court held that the power to reserve forests is an essential attribute of sovereignty, and the government has the power to reserve forests for the public good. The court also held that any person claiming any right in or over any land comprised in a reserved forest shall be required to prove that such right was created before the date of the notification or proclamation under Section 4 of the Act.
