The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/S Impex Commercial Pvt. Ltd. The petition challenged an order passed by the National Green Tribunal to disconnect electricity supply to their unit. The court issued a show cause notice to the respondents and directed officers of the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board to inspect the factory premises of the petitioner.

The inspection found that the petitioner was complying with the provisions of the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court took note of this finding and disposed of the writ petition. The court also allowed the Competent Authority to periodically check the premises of the petitioner.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The National Green Tribunal had ordered the disconnection of electricity supply to the petitioner's unit due to non-compliance with environmental norms. However, the court's inspection found that the petitioner was indeed complying with the relevant laws.

The court's decision to allow periodic checks by the Competent Authority is also noteworthy. This indicates that the court is keen on ensuring that the petitioner continues to comply with environmental regulations in the future. The Competent Authority will be able to monitor the petitioner's compliance and take appropriate action if necessary.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the petitioner and for the environment. It reinforces the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and ensures that the Competent Authority can monitor compliance effectively. The court's decision to dispose of the writ petition and allow periodic checks by the Competent Authority is a balanced approach that takes into account the interests of all parties involved.
