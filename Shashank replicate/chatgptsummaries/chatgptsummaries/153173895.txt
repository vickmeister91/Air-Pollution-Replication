The Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board issued a notice to M/s Hotel Shivalik, which was challenged by the petitioner in court. The court directed the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable as per the existing Municipal laws, and the extent of construction which is otherwise not compoundable. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court further directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing.

In another case, the petitioner violated the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act by carrying out construction almost 700% more than the sanctioned plan.

The court also ordered the petitioner to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
