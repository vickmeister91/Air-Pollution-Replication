The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for modification/clarification of a bail order. The applicants had been directed to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and solvent surety, but the trial court was insisting on sureties with a solvency certificate, which the applicants were unable to furnish. The court, therefore, directed the release of the applicants on bail on furnishing a personal bond and one competent surety each to the satisfaction of the trial court. The case was disposed of with this direction.

The Code of Criminal Procedure is a comprehensive legislation that governs the procedure for the investigation and trial of criminal cases in India. Section 482 of the Code empowers the High Court to exercise its inherent powers to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.

In the present case, the applicants had been granted bail by the trial court on the condition that they furnish a personal bond and solvent surety. However, the trial court was insisting on sureties with a solvency certificate, which the applicants were unable to furnish. This led to the filing of an application under Section 482 of the Code for modification/clarification of the bail order.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the release of the applicants on bail on furnishing a personal bond and one competent surety each to the satisfaction of the trial court. This direction was made in order to ensure that the applicants were not kept in custody due to the inability to furnish a solvency certificate for their sureties.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it highlights the importance of ensuring that the conditions for bail are reasonable and do not result in the continued detention of an accused person due to their inability to meet the conditions imposed by the court. The court's direction in this case ensures that the applicants are not kept in custody due to the inability to furnish a solvency certificate for their sureties, which would have resulted in a violation of their right to personal liberty.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for modification/clarification of a bail order. The court directed the release of the applicants on bail on furnishing a personal bond and one competent surety each to the satisfaction of the trial court. This direction was made in order to ensure that the applicants were not kept in custody due to the inability to furnish a solvency certificate for their sureties. The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of ensuring that the conditions for bail are reasonable and do not result in the continued detention of an accused person due to their inability to meet the conditions imposed by the court.
