The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving the possession of cannabis or charas, a substance derived from cannabis, under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (ND & PS) Act. The orders detail the events leading up to the arrests, the evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense, and the judgments handed down by the courts.

In the first court order, Manish Kumar filed a criminal appeal against a judgment of conviction under Section 20 of the ND & PS Act. The accused was caught with cannabis/charas in his possession during a routine check by police officials. The court upheld the conviction and sentenced the accused to two years' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, with a default sentence of two months' simple imprisonment. The order details the events leading up to the arrest and seizure of the contraband.

The second court order describes the process of seizing and analyzing a parcel containing charas and the subsequent conviction of the accused under Section 20 of the ND & PS Act. The defense argues that the conviction was based on a misappreciation of evidence, while the prosecution argues that the conviction was based on a mature and balanced appreciation of evidence. The court evaluates the evidence and finds that the prosecution case was successful in establishing the charge against the accused.

The third court order affirms the conviction of the accused for possession of charas but also notes that the prosecution failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt. The court finds that the investigating officer's actions were biased and that the testimony of an independent witness did not support the prosecution's case. The court also notes discrepancies in the evidence, including the condition of the lock on the bag of charas and the lack of a memo regarding the accused handing over the keys to the lock. The court ultimately concludes that the charge against the accused is not proven and warrants reversal.

The fourth court order states that the prosecution used a false recovery of contraband from the accused to charge him, and that the preparation of memos by the investigating officer was suspicious. The court found that the trial judge did not appraise the evidence properly and acquitted the accused. The appeal was allowed, and the impugned judgment was quashed and set aside. The case property was to be destroyed, and the fine amount was to be refunded to the accused.

In all of these cases, the courts were tasked with evaluating the evidence presented by both the prosecution and defense and determining whether the charges against the accused were proven beyond reasonable doubt. The courts also had to consider the actions of the investigating officers and the reliability of the evidence presented. In some cases, the courts found that the charges were proven and upheld the convictions, while in others, the courts found that the charges were not proven and acquitted the accused.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of a fair and impartial judicial system that carefully evaluates the evidence presented in criminal cases. They also underscore the need for law enforcement officials to conduct investigations in a fair and unbiased manner, and for the prosecution to present reliable and credible evidence to support their case.
