The court order in question pertains to a bail application submitted by the accused petitioner, Prahlad, in a case related to the Wild Life Animal Protection Act. The court found the condition of furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs. 1 lakh with two local sureties to be too harsh and substituted it with a condition of furnishing personal bonds of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The petitioner can be released on bail upon furnishing the above bonds.

The Wild Life Animal Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wild animals and their habitats from human activities that may harm them. The act provides for the establishment of protected areas, the regulation of hunting and trapping, and the prevention of illegal trade in wildlife and their products. Violations of the act can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.

In this case, Prahlad was accused of violating the act by hunting and killing a protected animal. He was arrested and charged with the offense, and subsequently applied for bail. The court considered his application and found that the condition of furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs. 1 lakh with two local sureties was too harsh.

A bank guarantee is a type of financial instrument that guarantees payment to a third party in case of default by the borrower. It is often required as a condition for granting bail, as it provides assurance that the accused will appear in court and comply with the conditions of bail. However, the court found that the amount of Rs. 1 lakh was excessive and substituted it with a condition of furnishing personal bonds of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each.

A personal bond is a type of bond that is executed by the accused and his sureties, and does not require any collateral or security. It is a promise to pay a certain amount of money in case of default, and is often used as an alternative to a bank guarantee. The court found that the personal bonds of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each would be sufficient to ensure the appearance of the accused in court and compliance with the conditions of bail.

The court's decision to substitute the bank guarantee with personal bonds is significant, as it reflects a growing trend towards more lenient bail conditions. In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the use of harsh bail conditions, particularly in cases where the accused is poor or marginalized. Such conditions can result in prolonged pre-trial detention, which can have serious consequences for the accused and their families.

The court's decision in this case is a positive step towards ensuring that bail conditions are fair and proportionate, and that they do not unduly restrict the rights of the accused. It also highlights the importance of judicial discretion in determining bail conditions, and the need for judges to consider the individual circumstances of each case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a bail application submitted by the accused petitioner, Prahlad, in a case related to the Wild Life Animal Protection Act. The court found the condition of furnishing a bank guarantee of Rs. 1 lakh with two local sureties to be too harsh and substituted it with a condition of furnishing personal bonds of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The petitioner can be released on bail upon furnishing the above bonds. This decision reflects a growing trend towards more lenient bail conditions and highlights the importance of judicial discretion in determining such conditions.
