The Kerala High Court recently passed an order in a case where the petitioners were facing allegations under the Kerala Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The investigation in the case was not complete, and the final report had not been filed yet. The petitioners had earlier sought anticipatory bail, which was dismissed by the bail bench of the court. Instead of challenging the order, the petitioners had come to the court again seeking a direction to the magistrate to consider their applications for regular bail on merits.

The court observed that the petitioners had not challenged the order of the bail bench, and therefore, the order had attained finality. The court further noted that the petitioners had not made any new grounds for seeking regular bail and that their applications were based on the same grounds that were considered by the bail bench. The court held that the petitioners could not be allowed to circumvent the order of the bail bench by approaching the court again on the same grounds.

The court also observed that the petitioners had not surrendered before the investigating officer or the magistrate, and therefore, their applications for regular bail could not be considered. The court directed the petitioners to surrender before the investigating officer or the magistrate and seek regular bail in the ordinary course. The court further observed that if the petitioners surrendered and sought bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the prosecutor, the magistrate must pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously.

The court's order is significant as it emphasizes the importance of following due process of law. The court has made it clear that the petitioners cannot circumvent the order of the bail bench by approaching the court again on the same grounds. The court has also emphasized the need for the petitioners to surrender before the investigating officer or the magistrate and seek regular bail in the ordinary course.

The court's order is also significant as it highlights the importance of expeditious disposal of bail applications. The court has directed the magistrate to pass appropriate orders on merits and expeditiously if the petitioners surrender and seek bail after giving sufficient prior notice to the prosecutor. This is in line with the Supreme Court's recent observations that bail applications should be disposed of expeditiously.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court's recent order in the case where the petitioners were facing allegations under the Kerala Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act emphasizes the importance of following due process of law and expeditious disposal of bail applications. The court has made it clear that the petitioners cannot circumvent the order of the bail bench by approaching the court again on the same grounds.
