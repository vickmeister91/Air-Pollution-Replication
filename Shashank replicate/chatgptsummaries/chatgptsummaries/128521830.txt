The Government of Tamil Nadu has filed a writ petition challenging the order passed by the National Green Tribunal in O.A. No. 164 of 2015 (SZ) which directed the government to pay a fine of Rs. 100 crores for polluting the Buckingham Canal. The second respondent, a social activist, had filed the original application claiming that the canal was highly polluted and posed a serious health hazard to the public. The canal serves as an important water link during water upsurge, cyclonic storms, and tsunami, but its present condition is dismal. The second respondent furnished a tabulated statement indicating the various sections in the city through which the canal flows.

The court order discusses a case where the Buckingham Canal in Chennai is blocked during heavy rains, causing sewage water to inundate parts of the city and contaminate groundwater. The petitioner filed an application seeking direction to remove debris and blockages in the canal, lay proper embankments, and plug sewer water inlets. The respondents filed reports indicating maintenance work and future plans, but the Tribunal imposed a fine of Rs. 100 crores on the state government. The Advocate General argued that the government has taken several steps towards restoration and implementation of projects worth Rs. 190.90 crores. The court is considering the maintainability of the writ petition and the legality of the Tribunal's order.

The court order discusses the maintainability of a writ petition filed against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The learned Advocate General argues that only an appeal can be filed before the Supreme Court against the order passed by the National Green Tribunal, but the writ petition under Article 226 of The Constitution of India is maintainable if there is any violation of principles of natural justice. The court also discusses the distinction between the provisions under The Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007 and National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. The court concludes that the writ petition is maintainable under Article 226 of The Constitution of India.

The court order discusses a writ petition filed against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal. The second respondent had filed an Original Application in 2015, complaining about pollution caused to a water body and the failure of the government to tackle it. The petitioner had filed various status reports on the progress made by them in the project commenced for restoration of Buckingham Canal. The court held that the Tribunal had afforded sufficient opportunity to the petitioner and passed the order after hearing the counsel for the petitioner through Video-conferencing. The court also held that the word "may" in Section 22 of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, does not give an option to the aggrieved person to approach the High Court under Article 226 of The Constitution of India.

The court order states that according to Section 22 of The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, any order, decision or award of the Tribunal can only be challenged before the Supreme Court of India. Therefore, the writ petition filed before this Court is not maintainable. The court also rejected the argument that the Tribunal violated principles of natural justice and held that the order was not passed in violation of principles of natural justice. As the writ petition is not maintainable, the court did not go into the merits of the contentions raised in the petition. The writ petition was dismissed as not maintainable.
