The Patna High Court recently issued an oral order in case number 5439 of 2016, which involved a petitioner named Shivam Kumar. Kumar was found to have been running a brick kiln without obtaining the necessary environmental clearance and No Objection Certificate, which is a violation of the law. As a result, the court directed Kumar to close the kiln immediately.

The case was scheduled to be disposed of on April 15, 2019, if nobody appeared on behalf of the petitioner. This means that if Kumar did not show up in court or send a representative, the case would be closed and the court's decision would be final.

It is important to note that environmental clearance and No Objection Certificates are required for certain types of businesses and activities in order to ensure that they are not harmful to the environment or public health. These certificates are issued by the appropriate government agencies after a thorough review of the proposed activity.

In this case, it appears that Kumar did not obtain the necessary certificates before starting his brick kiln. This is a serious violation of the law, as it could potentially harm the environment and the health of nearby residents.

The court's decision to order the closure of the kiln is a strong message to other businesses and individuals who may be operating without the necessary certificates. It is important to follow the law and obtain the appropriate clearances and certificates in order to protect the environment and public health.

Overall, the Patna High Court's oral order in case number 5439 of 2016 serves as a reminder of the importance of following environmental regulations and obtaining the necessary certificates before starting any business or activity that could potentially harm the environment or public health.
