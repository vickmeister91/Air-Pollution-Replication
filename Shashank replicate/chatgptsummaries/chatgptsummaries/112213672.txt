In a recent case, the petitioner, Vikram Singh Rajput, filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to quash an order passed by the trial court. The petitioner claimed that he was not provided with the x-ray report and plat to prove the injuries of the complainant, which was necessary for him to put up his defense properly. The trial court was directed to not take medical evidence into consideration until the x-ray report and plat were produced and supplied to the petitioner. The petition was disposed of accordingly.

The case involved an alleged assault on the complainant by the petitioner. The complainant had filed a complaint with the police, alleging that the petitioner had assaulted him and caused him injuries. The petitioner was subsequently arrested and charged with the offense of assault.

During the trial, the petitioner claimed that he had not assaulted the complainant and that the injuries were caused by some other person. He requested the court to provide him with the x-ray report and plat to prove his defense. However, the court did not provide him with the same and proceeded with the trial.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure seeking to quash the order passed by the trial court. He claimed that he was not provided with the x-ray report and plat, which was necessary for him to put up his defense properly. He argued that the trial court had erred in not providing him with the same and that the order passed by the trial court should be quashed.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the trial court to not take medical evidence into consideration until the x-ray report and plat were produced and supplied to the petitioner. The court held that the petitioner had a right to put up his defense properly and that the x-ray report and plat were necessary for him to do so. The court also held that the trial court had erred in not providing him with the same and that the order passed by the trial court should be quashed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of providing accused persons with all the necessary evidence to put up their defense properly. The court recognized that the petitioner had a right to a fair trial and that the x-ray report and plat were necessary for him to put up his defense properly. The court's decision also serves as a reminder to trial courts to ensure that accused persons are provided with all the necessary evidence to put up their defense properly.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a welcome development in the law relating to the rights of accused persons. The court's recognition of the importance of providing accused persons with all the necessary evidence to put up their defense properly is a step in the right direction. The decision also serves as a reminder to trial courts to ensure that accused persons are provided with all the necessary evidence to put up their defense properly.
