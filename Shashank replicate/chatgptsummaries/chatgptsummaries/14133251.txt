The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various writ petitions filed in relation to water pollution and encroachments on canals in Sri Ganganagar district, Rajasthan. The cases were transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication, and several directions were issued by the Division Bench of the court and NGT.

In one case, Kisturi Lal filed a writ petition raising grievances regarding water pollution in a minor canal passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The NGT directed the state to take effective measures to remove all inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages. The court noted that another writ petition, WP No. 718/2009, which concerns the main Ganga nahar Canal, would have much to say on the larger perspective and has been transferred from the High Court to the NGT for its final disposal.

The court order 718/2009 deals with the pollution and contamination of the Ganga Nahar Canal and has been transferred to the NGT for final disposal. The State has been directed to come up with short and long-term plans to free the canal and its distributories from encroachments and contamination. The State Pollution Control Board has been directed to collect water samples and analyze them. The State has come up with a long-term plan to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments, but the NGT has asked for more details. The NGT has also directed the State to impose damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on anyone found contaminating the water and to make citizens aware of this through notices. The NGT has requested the High Court to hand over the records of the case. The NGT has also directed the District Collector to be present on the next hearing date.

Another court order discusses the issue of encroachments on canals in Sriganganagar, Rajasthan, and the lack of action taken by the state government to remove them. The court directs the government to remove all encroachments within one month and issue notices to those causing pollution to pay compensation. The court also orders the removal of structures contributing to pollution and contamination of drinking water. The government is warned to comply with the directions or face appropriate action.

In another court order, the state was ordered to comply with directions to remove structures causing contamination of canal water and file a compliance report. The Chief Engineer filed an affidavit stating that the government's actions fall short of what is required. The District Collector was directed to appear before the Tribunal with complete information and record relevant to the proceedings. The court suggests that those aggrieved with the state's actions should approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases relating to environmental issues. The court also discusses the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court.

The court also discussed the circumstances under which a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued, even if an alternative remedy of appeal or revision is available. The court has the power to issue a writ if an inferior court or tribunal has acted without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, or if there has been a violation of natural justice. However, the court may still insist on the use of alternative remedies if they are efficacious. In this particular case, the court declines to invoke writ jurisdiction and dismisses the petition, allowing the petitioner to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) instead. The NGT has the power to condone any delay caused in approaching it and is expected to consider the application sympathetically. The State is restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner until December 31, 2016.

Overall, the court orders aim to address the issue of water pollution and encroachments on canals in Sri Ganganagar district, Rajasthan. The NGT has been given the responsibility to adjudicate on these matters and has issued several directions to the state government to take effective measures to remove encroachments and contamination of canal water. The court has also discussed the principle of exhausting all other statutory remedies before approaching the writ court and has allowed the petitioners to approach the NGT instead. The state government has been warned to comply with the directions or face appropriate action.
