The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to private forest land in Kerala, India. In one case, a writ petition was filed by Jose and four others against the State of Kerala, claiming ownership and possession of a 1.2-acre property in Malampuzha II Village, Palakkad Revenue District. The Forest Tribunal had excluded 68.5 acres of land from the purview of Sec.3(1) vesting by taking recourse to the provisions of Sec.3(3) of the Kerala Private Forest Act. The petitioners had purchased 1.62 acres of land from the excluded land from the previous owners. The State had not preferred any statutory appeal as against such verdict of the Forest Tribunal. However, later, by virtue of the amended provisions contained in Sec.8B of the Act, the State had preferred a Review Petition as R.P.No.626/1997 which was allowed by the Forest Tribunal thereby dismissing the O.A. The court found that the judgment of the Forest Tribunal allowing the Review Petition and thereby dismissing the O.A.No.471/1976 was clearly wrong and that the State could not properly establish that they have made a case of statutory review as enshrined in Sec.8B of the Act.

In another case, the State government attempted to vest land as ecologically fragile under the Kerala Forest Act, but the owners successfully argued that they had a clear intention to cultivate the land. Later, the government issued notifications under the Kerala Preservation of Trees Act and the Kerala Private Forests Act, which the owners challenged as illegal and ultra vires. The court must determine whether these notifications are valid and whether the land can be used for non-forestry purposes without prior permission from the Central Government.

The court order discusses two points of contention. The first point is whether a notification issued by the State Government under the Trees Act is illegal and liable for judicial intervention. The second point is whether a proceeding issued by the State Government ordering prior sanction for any non-forestry use of the petitioner's land is illegal and whether it requires judicial interference. The court refers to various provisions of the Private Forests Act and the Trees Act to determine the legality of these actions. The court also notes that previous owners of the petitioner's land had obtained valid title and were entitled to exclusion from the vesting process under the Private Forests Act.

The court order also pertains to private forests held by an owner under a valid registered document of title executed before the appointed day and intended for cultivation by him, which together with other lands held by him to which Chapter III of the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963, is applicable, does not exceed the extent of the ceiling area applicable to him under S.82 of the said Act. The order also discusses the definitions of "tree" and "private forest" as per various Acts and provides for restrictions on cutting of trees in notified areas. It further explains the exclusionary clauses contained in the definition of private forest as contemplated in the Private Forests Act, 1971.

The court order discusses the exclusionary clauses in the Private Forests Act, 1971, and how if a land falls within any of these clauses, it will be excluded from the definition of private forest and the operation of the Act. However, if the land does not fall within these clauses, it may still be excluded from the Act if it fulfills the conditions laid down in Sec.3(2) or 3(3). The order also discusses previous court rulings on the definition of private forest and how they apply to the current case.

In another case, the court order discusses two issues. The first issue is whether a notification prohibiting the cutting of trees on private forest land is legal. The court finds that it is legal, as the definition of "tree" in the Trees Act is broad enough to include any species of tree. The second issue is whether a government order requiring prior permission for non-forestry use of land is legal. The court finds that it is legal, as the Forest Conservation Act applies to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification, and prior approval from the Central Government is required for any non-forestry use of forest land. The court cites previous rulings to support its decision.

In another case, the court order states that for mining operations in a forest area that was cleared before the commencement of the Act, prior approval from the Central Government is not necessary. However, mining operations can only be carried out on the specific land where it has already been carried out and no standing trees can be removed without prior permission from the Central Government. The order also discusses the legality of a notification issued by Forest authorities under the Ecologically Fragile Land Act, which resulted in the dispossession of the petitioners' land. The custodian of EFL lands found that a portion of the land did not fulfill the definition of "forest" and "ecologically fragile land" and restored it to the petitioners.

In another case, the court order discusses a report by the Chief Conservator of Forests regarding a piece of land owned by the petitioners. The report found that the land had coconut palms, fruit-bearing mango and cashew trees, an old well, and remnants of an old house. The report also recommended a committee to assess the case and avoid undue hardships. The court found that cultivation had been going on in the land since at least
