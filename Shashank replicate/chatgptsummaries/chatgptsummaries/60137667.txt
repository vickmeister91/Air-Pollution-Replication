The Patna High Court has granted bail to Bhim Kumar Paswan, who was accused of seizing 29 tractors, including his own, which were loaded with illegally extracted sand. The petitioner's tractor was found empty and parked at the scene of the crime, leading to suspicion against him. The court has ordered his release on bail of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount, subject to certain conditions.

The case against Bhim Kumar Paswan was registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 21 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. The police had alleged that Paswan and his associates had seized 29 tractors loaded with illegally extracted sand from the banks of the river Ganga in the Buxar district of Bihar. The police had also claimed that Paswan's tractor was found empty and parked at the scene of the crime, which led to suspicion against him.

Paswan had filed a bail application before the Patna High Court, which was heard by Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah. Paswan's counsel had argued that he was falsely implicated in the case and that there was no evidence to prove his involvement in the crime. The counsel had also submitted that Paswan was a law-abiding citizen and had no criminal antecedents.

The prosecution, on the other hand, had opposed the bail application, stating that Paswan was the main accused in the case and that his release on bail would hamper the investigation. The prosecution had also submitted that Paswan had a history of criminal cases against him.

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to Paswan on the condition that he would cooperate with the investigation and not tamper with the evidence. The court also directed Paswan to deposit his passport, if any, with the investigating officer and not to leave the country without the court's permission. Paswan was also directed to appear before the investigating officer as and when required.

The court's decision to grant bail to Paswan has been welcomed by his family and supporters. They have claimed that Paswan was falsely implicated in the case and that he had no role in the seizure of the tractors. They have also alleged that the police had targeted Paswan because of his political affiliations.

The case against Paswan is still under investigation, and the police are yet to make any arrests in connection with the seizure of the tractors. The court's decision to grant bail to Paswan has come as a relief to his family and supporters, who have been campaigning for his release.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted bail to Bhim Kumar Paswan, who was accused of seizing 29 tractors loaded with illegally extracted sand. The court has ordered his release on bail of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of the same amount, subject to certain conditions.
