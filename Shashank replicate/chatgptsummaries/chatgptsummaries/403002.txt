In a recent court order, the petitioner's claim for exemption under Section 54E of the Income-tax Act was upheld. The case pertained to the acquisition of land belonging to the petitioner by the government for the construction of a dairy plant. The petitioner had claimed exemption for the capital gains arising from the transfer of the land, but the Income-tax Officer had rejected the claim on the grounds that the amount had not been invested in specified securities within six months from the date of transfer and that the investments made were not specified securities as on the date of transfer.

The court held that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of Section 54E as the compensation was received within six months of the investment in specified securities and the investments made were in fact specified securities. The court quashed the order of the Income-tax Officer and directed the reworking of the benefit available to the petitioner.

Section 54E of the Income-tax Act provides for exemption from capital gains tax on the transfer of a long-term capital asset if the amount of capital gains is invested in specified securities within six months from the date of transfer. The specified securities include bonds issued by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) or Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) or any other bond notified by the central government in this behalf.

In the present case, the petitioner had invested the amount of capital gains in specified securities within six months from the date of transfer. However, the Income-tax Officer had rejected the claim on the grounds that the investments made were not specified securities as on the date of transfer.

The court, after examining the provisions of Section 54E and the facts of the case, held that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the section. The court observed that the compensation received by the petitioner was within six months of the investment in specified securities and the investments made were in fact specified securities. Therefore, the court quashed the order of the Income-tax Officer and directed the reworking of the benefit available to the petitioner.

This court order is significant as it clarifies the interpretation of Section 54E of the Income-tax Act and provides relief to taxpayers who have invested in specified securities within the prescribed time limit but have been denied the benefit of exemption due to technical reasons. The order also highlights the importance of complying with the provisions of the Income-tax Act and investing in specified securities within the prescribed time limit to avail the benefit of exemption from capital gains tax.
