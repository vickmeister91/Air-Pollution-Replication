The Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority has filed appeals against a High Court judgment and order allowing construction activities in the notified Coastal Regulations Zones (CRZ) areas. The appellant authority has been constituted by the Government of India to deal with environmental issues relating to the CRZ. The construction activities of the respondent builders are on the shores of the backwaters in Ernakulam in the State of Kerala which supports exceptionally large biological diversity and constitutes one of the largest wetlands in India. The area in which the respondents have carried out construction activities is part of tidal influenced water body and the construction activities in those areas are strictly restricted under the provisions of the CRZ Notifications. The court has constituted a Three-Member Committee to determine whether the area in question is in CRZ Category-III, Category-I or Category-II.

The court order appoints a Three-Member Committee to hear objections and determine the legality of construction in a specific area categorized under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The committee finds that the area falls under CRZ-III and that no construction is permitted within 200 meters of the High Tide Line, except for repairs of authorized structures. The local authority, Panchayat, cannot grant permission without the concurrence of the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority. Rule 23(4) of the Rules of 1999 states that any land development or building construction in a coastal regulation zone shall be subject to the restrictions contained in the notification.

The court order states that building construction without permission from the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority is impermissible and unauthorized. The court takes notice of recent devastation in Kerala due to unbridled construction activities resulting in colossal loss of human life and property. The court cites previous cases where construction in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone notifications was not condoned. The court also notes that even if permits were obtained, construction in CRZ-I is impermissible. The court rejects the argument that the resort promotes tourism and creates jobs, stating that the company's activities are illegal.

The court order states that a company promoting tourism in Kerala, which has immense potential for tourism, must abide by environmental safeguards and laws. The court finds that constructions made in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone Regulations are not to be taken lightly and must be removed within a month. The permission granted by the Panchayat was illegal and void, and no development activity could have taken place. The appeals are allowed with the direction to remove all structures within a month.

In summary, the Kerala State Coastal Zone Management Authority has filed appeals against a High Court judgment and order allowing construction activities in the notified Coastal Regulations Zones (CRZ) areas.
