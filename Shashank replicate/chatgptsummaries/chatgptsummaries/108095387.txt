The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Khategaon, District Dewas. The order in question had rejected the petitioner's application filed under Section 451 and 457 of the Cr.P.C. for custody of a seized vehicle. The vehicle had been seized for an offence punishable under various Acts, including the Indian Forest Act, 1927.

The petitioner had relied on various judgments to support their case, but the court found that the impugned order was based on valid and cogent reasons and was fully in consonance with the provisions of the Act, 1927. As a result, the petition was dismissed.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927 is a piece of legislation that regulates the management of forests in India. It provides for the protection of forests and wildlife, as well as the prevention of forest offences. The Act also empowers forest officers to seize vehicles and other property that are suspected to have been used in the commission of forest offences.

In this case, the vehicle in question had been seized for an offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. for the release of the vehicle, which was rejected by the lower court. The petitioner then filed an application under Section 457 of the Cr.P.C. for custody of the vehicle, which was also rejected.

The petitioner had argued that the lower court had erred in rejecting their application for custody of the vehicle. They had relied on various judgments to support their case, but the court found that these judgments were not applicable to the facts of the case.

The court noted that the impugned order was based on valid and cogent reasons. The lower court had found that the vehicle was seized for an offence under the Indian Forest Act, 1927, and that there was a likelihood of the vehicle being used for further commission of the offence. The lower court had also found that the petitioner had failed to establish that they were the owner of the vehicle.

The court further noted that the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, empowered forest officers to seize vehicles and other property that were suspected to have been used in the commission of forest offences. The Act also provided for the custody of such property until the conclusion of the trial.

In light of these provisions, the court found that the lower court's order was fully in consonance with the provisions of the Act, 1927. The court also found that the petitioner had failed to establish any grounds for interference under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petitioner's petition under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Khategaon, District Dewas, which had rejected their application for custody of a seized vehicle. The court found that the impugned order was based on valid and cogent reasons and was fully in consonance with the provisions of the Indian Forest Act, 1927.
