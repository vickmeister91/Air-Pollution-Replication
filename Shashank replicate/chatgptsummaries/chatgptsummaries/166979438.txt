The court has granted bail to Rakesh Jatav, who had been in custody since March 20, 2016, in connection with a case registered at Police Station Purani Chawani, District Gwalior for offenses punishable under Section 353, 379 of IPC and section 27, 29 of Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C and ordered Jatav to furnish a bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety bond of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court. The order would be effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it would become ineffective.
