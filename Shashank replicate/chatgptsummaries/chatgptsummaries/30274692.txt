The court heard three writ appeals that raised common questions of law and fact. The appeals were filed against the judgments of the learned Single Judge who directed the grant of short term permits without insisting on environmental clearance to remove the quantity of red earth recommended by the Tahsildar and also to transport the same to the railway site. The State Government and State authorities challenged the judgments of the learned Single Judge, arguing that extraction of red earth is not permissible without obtaining environmental clearance. The petitioners argued that the red earth is required for the purpose of Railway work, i.e., doubling of Railway track, for which work no environmental clearance is necessary by virtue of Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989.

The court order discusses two main issues related to the requirement of environmental clearance for the work of the Railway, which is considered to be in public interest. The court examines Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989, which empowers the Railway administrations to execute all necessary works for constructing or maintaining a railway. However, the court concludes that Section 11 is not applicable in the present case, where the petitioners are claiming the right to mine/extract red earth from the survey numbers owned by private persons. The court also discusses a Division Bench judgment of the Bombay High Court reported in Goa Foundation v. Konkan Railway Corporation (AIR 1992 Bombay 471), which held that there was no necessity to obtain environmental clearance by virtue of Section 11 of the Act, 1989. However, the court notes that the facts of that case were different, as the Corporation had acquired the land on which the Corporation intended to proceed to lay down the Railway line.

The court order discusses a case where the Railway Ministry altered the initial alignment of a railway project to avoid passing through crowded villages. The Railway Ministry commissioned a government enterprise to assess the environmental impact of the project and concluded that there would be no adverse effects. The court also discusses the applicability of various laws and regulations to the project, including the Railways Act and the Environment Act. The court concludes that the Railway Ministry cannot carry out any work on private land without compensation or accommodation work and that no mining can be done without obtaining environmental clearance. The court also notes that an exemption granted to the Kochi Metro Rail Corporation for removing minor minerals is specific to that project and cannot be applied to the current case.

The court order states that mining and quarrying operations cannot be permitted without an approved mining plan, except for existing lease holders who have been allowed time to submit a mining plan. The court found that a short-term permit for sand extraction without environmental clearance was not permissible and set aside the judgments in favor of the petitioners. The court allowed the petitioners to move an appropriate application for obtaining a mining permit in accordance with the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015. The court also noted a decision taken in a meeting regarding quarrying of earth for railway doubling works without environmental clearance, but stated that the issue of whether environmental clearance is required for sub-contractors for excavation of earth shall arise only when any such government orders are issued. The court allowed the writ appeals, set aside the judgments of the learned single judge, and dismissed the writ petitions, subject to the liberty mentioned in paragraph 24.

In summary, the court heard three writ appeals related to the extraction of red earth for the purpose of railway work. The State Government and State authorities argued that environmental clearance was necessary for the extraction of red earth, while the petitioners claimed that no clearance was required under Section 11 of the Railways Act, 1989. The court examined Section 11 and concluded that it was not applicable in this case, as the petitioners were claiming the right to mine/extract red earth from private land. The court also discussed a case where the Railway Ministry altered the alignment of a railway project to avoid passing through crowded villages and concluded that no work could be carried out on private land without compensation or accommodation work and that no mining could be done without obtaining environmental clearance. The court set aside the judgments in favor of the petitioners and allowed them to move an appropriate application for obtaining a mining permit in accordance with the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015. The court also noted a decision taken in a meeting regarding quarrying of earth for railway doubling works without environmental clearance, but stated that the issue of whether environmental clearance is required for sub-contractors for excavation of earth shall arise only when any such government orders are issued.
