The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court noted that while it has the power to review and reconsider evidence, it should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the lower court's approach is vitiated by manifest illegality or the conclusion is perverse. The court found that the appellant had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and upheld the acquittal.

The court order states that R&P (rebuttal and proof) is not necessary to decide the appeal, as the trial court's conclusion has not been challenged. The appellant has not provided any evidence to contradict the trial court's decision, and the court finds no reason to interfere with the acquittal of the respondents. The appeal is dismissed, and the record and proceedings are sent back to the trial court.
