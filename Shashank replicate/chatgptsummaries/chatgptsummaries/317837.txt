In the first court order, the petitioner, Vijay Dhandapani, filed criminal original petitions under Section 407 of the Criminal Procedure Code to withdraw and transfer the case in S.T.C.Nos.2865, 2867, 2866 and 2868/2007 pending on the file of the learned XII Judge, Small Causes Court/Special Magistrate, Chennai to the file of any other Court of competent jurisdiction in Chennai. The accused in all the four STCs is the petitioner in these criminal OPs. He has pleaded for transfer of the cases from the present trial court to any other court on the ground that he was not given reasonable opportunity to defend himself in the criminal cases pending against him and that the Presiding Officer of the trial court expressed her decision in the open court to convict him. The court considered the submissions made on either side and perused the materials available on record including the petition, affidavits and documents produced in the form of typed set of papers and also the remarks received from the trial court.

After considering all the submissions and materials, the court denied the petitioner's request to transfer the cases to another court. The court found that the petitioner's claim of not being given a reasonable opportunity to defend himself was not supported by any evidence. The court also found that the Presiding Officer's remarks in open court did not indicate any bias or prejudice against the petitioner. Therefore, the court dismissed the criminal original petitions filed by the petitioner.

In the second court order, the petitioner's request to produce documents and recall witnesses in a criminal case was denied. The lower appellate court had already given clear directions on the matter, but the petitioner was attempting to drag out the case and coerce the complainants. The court found no merit in the petitioner's requests and dismissed the case.

Overall, both court orders dealt with criminal cases and the petitioner's requests for various reliefs. In the first order, the petitioner sought to transfer the cases to another court, while in the second order, the petitioner sought to produce documents and recall witnesses. In both cases, the court found no merit in the petitioner's requests and dismissed the cases. These court orders demonstrate the importance of presenting strong evidence and arguments in support of any requests made to the court.
