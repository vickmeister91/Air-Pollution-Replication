The Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad challenged the order passed by the appellate authority and the revised assessment order, seeking a declaration that the requirements denoted by the word "successfully" and by the words "and so long as it functions successfully" in Rule 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1976 are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 7 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 and therefore inoperative and void. The petitioner Corporation argued that the entitlement to get 70% rebate under Section 7 came into existence when the plant for treatment of sewage or trade effluent was installed. The learned Counsel argued that, so far as the Corporation is concerned, two such sewage plants were installed much before the coming into force of the Cess Act. These plants were meant for the treatment of sewage.

The court order discusses the interpretation of Section 7 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, which provides for a rebate on the cess payable by a person or local authority who installs a plant for the treatment of sewage or trade effluent. The court holds that the plant must be capable of achieving the prescribed standards of treatment and must be functioning successfully to qualify for the rebate. The court also emphasizes that the court cannot rewrite or add words to a statute and must interpret it in accordance with its purpose and context.

The court order discusses the entitlement to a rebate for consumers who have successfully installed and operated a plant for the treatment of sewage or trade effluent. The court states that the entitlement to the rebate is linked to the successful functioning of the plant and will cease if the plant stops working effectively. The court also notes that occasional failures of the plant should not result in the denial of the rebate for the entire period, but rather the period of successful functioning should be taken into account. The court upholds the validity of Rule 6 of the Cess Rules, which outlines the entitlement to the rebate. The court rejects the petitioner's challenge against the validity of the rule and dismisses the petitions.

The case at hand involves a challenge by the Municipal Corporation of the City of Ahmedabad against the order passed by the appellate authority and the revised assessment order. The Corporation sought a declaration that the requirements denoted by the word "successfully" and by the words "and so long as it functions successfully" in Rule 6 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1976 are inconsistent with the provisions of Section 7 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 and therefore inoperative and void.

The court's decision is based on a careful interpretation of the relevant statutes and rules. The court notes that the purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 is to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons carrying on certain industries and by local authorities, with a view to augmenting the resources of the Central Board and the State Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The court also notes that the purpose of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1976 is to provide for the manner of assessment and collection of the cess.

The court's interpretation of Section 7 of the Cess Act is that the rebate is available only to those who have installed a plant for the treatment of sewage or trade effluent that is capable of achieving the prescribed standards of treatment and is functioning successfully. The court notes that the word "successfully" is not redundant and must be given its full meaning. The court also notes that the word "successfully" is used in the present tense, indicating that the plant must be functioning successfully at the time of the claim for the rebate.
