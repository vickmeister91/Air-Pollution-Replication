The court order in question relates to a case brought by M/s Rashi Plypack, which has challenged a notification issued by the Forest and Environment Department that prohibits the manufacture, use, storage, distribution, and sale of polythene carry bags up to 50 microns specification of 18"x12" size. The petitioner's registration certificate is not on record, and the court has given them three weeks to obtain the necessary documents. The case has been listed for admission in March 2016.

The case centers around the use of polythene carry bags, which have been a major source of environmental pollution in India. The Forest and Environment Department's notification seeks to address this issue by prohibiting the manufacture, use, storage, distribution, and sale of such bags up to a certain specification. M/s Rashi Plypack, however, has challenged this notification on the grounds that it is arbitrary and violates their right to carry on their business.

The court has given the petitioner three weeks to obtain the necessary documents, including their registration certificate, which is not on record. This suggests that the court is taking a cautious approach to the case and wants to ensure that all relevant information is available before making a decision. The case has been listed for admission in March 2016, which means that it will be heard by the court at that time.

It is worth noting that the use of polythene carry bags has been a contentious issue in India for many years. These bags are cheap and convenient, but they are also a major source of environmental pollution. They take hundreds of years to decompose and can cause harm to wildlife and marine life. Many states in India have already banned the use of such bags, and the central government has also taken steps to address the issue.

In this context, the court's decision to hear the case brought by M/s Rashi Plypack is significant. It suggests that the court is willing to consider the arguments put forward by the petitioner and may be open to the possibility of overturning the Forest and Environment Department's notification. However, it is important to note that the court has not yet made a decision on the matter and will need to consider all relevant factors before doing so.

Overall, the court order in question relates to a case brought by M/s Rashi Plypack challenging a notification issued by the Forest and Environment Department prohibiting the manufacture, use, storage, distribution, and sale of polythene carry bags up to a certain specification. The court has given the petitioner three weeks to obtain the necessary documents and has listed the case for admission in March 2016. The case is significant in the context of the ongoing debate around the use of polythene carry bags in India and suggests that the court is willing to consider the arguments put forward by the petitioner. However, it is important to note that the court has not yet made a decision on the matter and will need to consider all relevant factors before doing so.
