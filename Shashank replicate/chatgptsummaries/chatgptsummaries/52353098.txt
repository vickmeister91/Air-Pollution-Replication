The Bombay High Court has quashed and set aside an FIR registered against Madhav Govind Shembekar and B. Chiranjeev Reddy for an offense punishable under Section 13 of the Maharashtra Cotton Seeds Act, 2009, Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The criminal application was filed by the two individuals against the State of Maharashtra and Dr. Pankaj Vinayakrao Chede.

The court order was issued after the prosecution admitted that the initial test report against the applicants was contradictory and the final report was negative as regards HT Gene. Therefore, there was no warrant for the authority to proceed with the investigation of the FIR in any manner. The court allowed the application and made the rule absolute in the above terms.

The Maharashtra Cotton Seeds Act, 2009, regulates the production, supply, distribution, and sale of cotton seeds in the state of Maharashtra. Section 13 of the Act deals with the punishment for selling or distributing cotton seeds that are not of the prescribed quality. Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, deals with the punishment for contravening any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder. Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code deals with the punishment for cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property.

The FIR against Shembekar and Reddy was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by Dr. Chede, who alleged that the applicants had sold cotton seeds that were not of the prescribed quality and had also violated the provisions of the Environment Protection Act. The applicants had challenged the FIR on the grounds that the allegations made against them were false and baseless.

During the course of the investigation, the prosecution had conducted tests on the cotton seeds sold by the applicants. The initial test report had indicated the presence of HT Gene in the cotton seeds, which is a genetically modified organism. However, the final report had negated the presence of HT Gene in the cotton seeds. The prosecution had admitted that the initial test report was contradictory and that the final report was negative as regards HT Gene.

The court, after considering the submissions made by the parties, held that there was no warrant for the authority to proceed with the investigation of the FIR in any manner. The court observed that the prosecution had failed to establish a prima facie case against the applicants and that the allegations made against them were false and baseless. The court, therefore, quashed and set aside the FIR registered against the applicants.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court has quashed and set aside an FIR registered against Madhav Govind Shembekar and B. Chiranjeev Reddy for an offense punishable under Section 13 of the Maharashtra Cotton Seeds Act, 2009, Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The court order was issued after the prosecution admitted that the initial test report against the applicants was contradictory and the final report was negative as regards HT Gene. The court held that there was no warrant for the authority to proceed with the investigation of the FIR in any manner and quashed and set aside the FIR registered against the applicants.
