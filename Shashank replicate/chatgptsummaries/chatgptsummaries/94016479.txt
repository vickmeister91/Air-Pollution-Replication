The Delhi High Court recently upheld the conviction of Hem Karan Bidhuri under Sections 24, 25, and 33A of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the minimum sentence of one year and six months and fine imposed by the trial court. The case was brought by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) for discharging untreated trade effluent in violation of the Act. The petitioner challenged the conviction on the grounds that no water sample was lifted and analyzed, and that the unit was not a water discharging unit. However, the court rejected these arguments and upheld the conviction.

The court order states that the petitioner's industrial unit discharged untreated effluent into a drain sewer causing severe pollution. The petitioner's counsel relied on a Supreme Court decision where a unit with permission was acquitted, but the respondent's counsel argued that the petitioner's unit was running without consent. The court found that non-lifting of water samples for analysis was not fatal to the case and that the petitioner's unit was running without mandatory consent under the Water Act. The conviction and sentence awarded to the petitioner were upheld based on evidence from members of the inspection team. The court found no illegality or infirmity in the impugned order and dismissed the petition.

The case highlights the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to prevent and control water pollution. The Act provides for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, and empowers them to take measures to prevent and control water pollution. The Act also lays down penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) brought the case against Hem Karan Bidhuri for discharging untreated trade effluent in violation of the Act. The court found that the petitioner's unit was running without mandatory consent under the Water Act, and that non-lifting of water samples for analysis was not fatal to the case. The conviction and sentence awarded to the petitioner were upheld based on evidence from members of the inspection team.

The case also highlights the role of the judiciary in enforcing environmental laws and regulations. The court's decision to uphold the conviction and sentence sends a strong message to other industrial units that flouting environmental laws and regulations will not be tolerated. It also underscores the need for strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations to protect the environment and public health.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's decision to uphold the conviction and sentence of Hem Karan Bidhuri under Sections 24, 25, and 33A of The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, highlights the importance of complying with environmental laws and regulations.
