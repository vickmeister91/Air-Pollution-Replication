The Government of Tamil Nadu had appealed a court order that allowed Tata Tea Limited to not obtain any permit, consent, or license from the state government or its authorities for felling/transporting or using trees grown by them in their own estates/plantations for the manufacture of tea or domestic use in connection with the tea industry. The court upheld the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Hill Areas (Preservation of Trees) Act, which requires permission in writing from the committee for cutting trees, even for use as fuel. The Act was enacted to regulate the cutting of trees and the cultivation of land in hill areas in the state of Tamil Nadu to prevent deforestation and soil erosion.

The court order directs the State Government to obtain a report from TANTEA regarding the fuel trees planted by the plantations for fuel wood outside the forest area. The felling of Eucalyptus and Wattle trees in such areas may be done by the plantations for their own use as permitted by the statutory committee. The State Government is also directed to identify areas of the plantation which are a forest and are not in active use as a plantation, and no felling of any trees is permitted in these areas. The court upholds the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Hill Areas (Preservation of Trees) Act, 1955, and declares that permission in writing of the Committee is mandatory for cutting and removing of trees. The order of the learned single Judge declaring that no permission is required for cutting and removing of trees is opposed to the provisions of the Act and is set aside.
