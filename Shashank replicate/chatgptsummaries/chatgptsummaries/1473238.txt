The court order in question pertains to a case where land measuring approximately 4.10 acres was granted to the appellant, but it was later found to be within the boundary of a reserve forest, which is prohibited under the Forest Reservation Act. The learned Single Judge confirmed the order and directed an enquiry to identify the officers responsible for the grant of land.

The appellant's advocate argued that the State Government had set up a committee to examine such cases and recommended the grant of land, but the court found that the law prescribes a total bar on the granting of forest land. The court declined the appellant's request to defer any further action until the application for permission within the framework of the Forest Conservation Act was examined and decided.

The court upheld the order passed by the learned Single Judge and set aside the order for payment of costs of Rs. 5,000/-. The court's decision was based on the fact that the land in question was within the boundary of a reserve forest, which is prohibited under the Forest Reservation Act. The court found that the State Government's committee had no authority to grant land within the boundary of a reserve forest, and that the law prescribes a total bar on the granting of forest land.

The court also directed an enquiry to identify the officers responsible for the grant of land. This was done to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future. The court's decision was a clear message to the State Government and other authorities that they must follow the law and not grant land within the boundary of a reserve forest.
