The Kerala High Court recently issued an order in response to a petition filed by a chicken stall owner seeking relief against the order of the Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had obtained a trade license from the Municipality and had been issued a consent to operate the chicken stall by the Pollution Control Board. However, the consent was later revoked without affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The petitioner's appeal against the revocation had been pending for two months.

The court directed the Appellate Authority to hear the interim application and appeal so that the petitioner can ventilate his grievance. The court also ordered an interim stay of the appeal during its pendency if the interim application is not heard. The order included copies of various documents, including a reply submitted by the petitioner on October 18, 2019, a consent revoke order issued by the first respondent on November 4, 2019, a memorandum of appeal in appeal number 19/2019 on the files of the fourth respondent, and a stay petition as I.A. No. 54/2019 in appeal number 19/2019 on the files of the fourth respondent.
