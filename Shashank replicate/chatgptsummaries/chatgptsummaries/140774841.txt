The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner, Rishabh, under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Indore in Sessions Trial No. 497/2015. The petitioner claimed that his non-applicant wife had filed unnecessary and unrelated documents in the case, causing prejudice to him. 

Upon examination of the case, the court found that the documents in question were prima facie required for the allegations made in the complaint. As such, the court directed the petitioner to raise objections regarding the admissibility of the documents at the time of recording of evidence of the complaint. The court did not comment on the merits of the case and allowed the Trial Court to arrive at its own conclusion.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. In this case, the petitioner was seeking relief under this section due to the alleged prejudice caused by the filing of unnecessary documents by his wife.

The court's decision to allow the Trial Court to arrive at its own conclusion is in line with the principles of natural justice, which require that parties be given a fair opportunity to present their case and that decisions be made based on the evidence presented. By directing the petitioner to raise objections regarding the admissibility of the documents at the time of recording of evidence, the court ensured that the Trial Court would have the opportunity to consider the relevance and admissibility of the documents in question.

It is important to note that the court did not comment on the merits of the case. This means that the court did not make any determination as to whether the allegations made by the petitioner were true or false. Instead, the court focused on the procedural issue of the admissibility of the documents and allowed the Trial Court to make a determination based on the evidence presented.

Overall, the court's decision in this case highlights the importance of procedural fairness in the administration of justice. By allowing the Trial Court to make its own determination based on the evidence presented, the court ensured that both parties had a fair opportunity to present their case and that the decision was made based on the merits of the evidence.
