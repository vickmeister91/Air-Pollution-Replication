The court orders discussed in this summary all relate to cases involving the Bihar State Pollution Control Board and the termination of employees. In the first court order, Bishundeo Tiwari and others filed a Letters Patent Appeal challenging the dismissal of their writ petition to quash an office order terminating their services. The appellants argued that the Board had previously supported their regularization but turned against them after receiving a letter from the government. The court considered the arguments and ultimately dismissed the appeal, stating that the Board and its authorities must act independently as per the provisions of the law and not tow the line of the government.

The second court order discusses a case where the appellants were removed from their positions in the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The appellants argued that their initial appointment was legal and that they fulfilled all the criteria for their positions. The respondent argued that the initial appointment was irregular and that the appellants were casual employees who could be removed at any time. The court found that the appellants were appointed to vacant sanctioned posts by a competent authority and had fulfilled the necessary qualifications. The court also noted that the Full Bench decision in Ram Sevak Yadav did not apply to this case.

The third court order discusses a case where the appellants were removed from their positions by the Board despite being eligible for regularization of their services. The Board had previously decided in favor of the appellants and had taken legal advice from the Advocate General, who affirmed their decision. However, the State Government gave frivolous and misconceived directions to the Board, which led to the removal of the appellants. The court found that the State Government had no authority to interfere in such matters, and the Board was an independent and autonomous body capable of taking steps on their own as per the law governing the Board without any external pressure or influence. The court allowed the appeal, set aside the impugned orders, and directed the authorities of the Board to reinstate the appellants to their respective posts with effect from 28.04.2003. The appellants or any other similarly situated persons would be entitled to again raise their claim for regularization before an appropriate forum.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following the provisions of the law and acting independently for government bodies such as the Bihar State Pollution Control Board. The court emphasized that external pressure or influence should not be a factor in decision-making and that employees should be treated fairly and in accordance with their qualifications and appointments.
