In a recent court order, the court addressed a case where the first defendant had filed two revision petitions seeking revision of two interlocutory orders of the subordinate judge with reference to inspection of his documents by the plaintiff. The court held that the lower court had not properly understood the provisions of Order 11, Rule 14, of the Civil Procedure Code and that the result of its orders may cause unnecessary and irremediable damage to the first defendant's business interests.

The court ordered that the plaintiff cannot be allowed to inspect any documents that do not bear on the question of partnership until he establishes that he is a partner. This means that the plaintiff cannot simply request to inspect any document that he wants, but rather must establish that the document is relevant to the question of partnership. The court also ordered that inspection on behalf of the plaintiff by a former employee of the first defendant's firm cannot be permitted until the plaintiff establishes his plea of partnership. This is because the former employee may have access to confidential information that could harm the first defendant's business interests.

The court emphasized that the privilege of inspection by a party of his adversary's documents is not a matter of routine and must be exercised with caution. This means that the plaintiff cannot simply request to inspect any document that he wants, but rather must establish that the document is relevant to the question of partnership. The court also noted that the plaintiff must exercise caution when inspecting documents, as he may come across confidential information that could harm the first defendant's business interests.

Overall, the court order is aimed at protecting the first defendant's business interests while still allowing the plaintiff to inspect relevant documents. The court recognizes that the plaintiff has a right to inspect documents that are relevant to the question of partnership, but also recognizes that the first defendant has a right to protect his confidential information. By ordering that the plaintiff cannot inspect any documents that do not bear on the question of partnership until he establishes that he is a partner, the court is ensuring that the plaintiff does not have access to confidential information that could harm the first defendant's business interests. Similarly, by ordering that inspection on behalf of the plaintiff by a former employee of the first defendant's firm cannot be permitted until the plaintiff establishes his plea of partnership, the court is ensuring that the first defendant's confidential information is not compromised.

In conclusion, the court order is a balanced approach to the issue of document inspection in the context of a partnership dispute. It recognizes the rights of both parties and ensures that the plaintiff can inspect relevant documents while also protecting the first defendant's business interests. The court's emphasis on caution when exercising the privilege of inspection is a reminder that this privilege should not be taken lightly and should only be exercised when necessary.
