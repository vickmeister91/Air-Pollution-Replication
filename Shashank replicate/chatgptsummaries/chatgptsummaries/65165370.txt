In a recent court order, the legality of freezing bank accounts under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was challenged. The investigating officer had taken this action under Section 91, but it should have been under Section 102. The court examined the applicability of Section 102 and the pre-requisites for its exercise. The court found that the prosecution had not fulfilled the first condition that the property proposed to be seized must be stolen or suspected to be stolen or obtained by commission of some crime. The court also noted that the Fixed Deposit Receipt (FDR) appears to be obtained by investing money that had no connection to the crime committed by the main accused in the case. Therefore, the property in the accounts does not have any connection to the crime.

The court order further stated that the impugned communications were illegal and deserved to be quashed and set aside. As a result, the accounts were defreezed. This decision was based on the fact that the FDR was not obtained using money that had any connection to the crime committed by the main accused in the case. The court found that the property in the accounts did not have any connection to the crime and therefore, the freezing of the accounts was not justified.

The court's decision was based on the interpretation of Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This section allows for the seizure of property that is suspected to be stolen or obtained by commission of some crime. The court found that the prosecution had not fulfilled the first condition of this section, which is that the property proposed to be seized must be stolen or suspected to be stolen or obtained by commission of some crime. The court also noted that the FDR appears to be obtained by investing money that had no connection to the crime committed by the main accused in the case.

The court's decision is significant as it highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures when freezing bank accounts. It also emphasizes the need for the prosecution to fulfill the pre-requisites for the exercise of Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court's decision ensures that the rights of the accused are protected and that the legal process is followed correctly.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertaining to the freezing of bank accounts under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure highlights the importance of following the correct legal procedures. The court's decision emphasizes the need for the prosecution to fulfill the pre-requisites for the exercise of Section 102 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
