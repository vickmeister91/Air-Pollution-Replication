The court has granted bail to Krishan Lal, who was arrested in connection with an offense under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The petitioner has been ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to appear before the court on all hearing dates.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. Section 9/51 of the Act deals with the hunting of wild animals and the possession of their body parts. The offense under this section is a non-bailable offense, which means that the accused cannot be released on bail as a matter of right.

Krishan Lal was arrested for allegedly hunting a wild animal and possessing its body parts. He was produced before the court, and the prosecution opposed his bail application, stating that the offense was serious and that there was a likelihood of the petitioner absconding if released on bail.

However, the court considered the facts and circumstances of the case and granted bail to the petitioner. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. The court also directed the petitioner to appear before the court on all hearing dates.

The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court. The court has to consider various factors before granting bail, such as the nature of the offense, the severity of the punishment, the likelihood of the accused absconding, and the possibility of the accused tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses.

In this case, the court considered the fact that the petitioner was not a habitual offender and that he had no criminal antecedents. The court also noted that the petitioner had cooperated with the investigation and had not tampered with evidence or influenced witnesses. The court further observed that the petitioner had a fixed place of residence and that he was not likely to abscond if released on bail.

Therefore, the court granted bail to the petitioner, subject to the conditions mentioned above. The petitioner will have to appear before the court on all hearing dates and comply with any other conditions that the court may impose from time to time.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Krishan Lal, who was arrested in connection with an offense under Section 9/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court has ordered the petitioner to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to appear before the court on all hearing dates. The grant of bail is a discretionary power of the court, and the court has considered various factors before granting bail to the petitioner.
