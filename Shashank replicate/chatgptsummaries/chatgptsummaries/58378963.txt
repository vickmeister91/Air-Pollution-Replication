The court order in question pertains to a case where a tractor was seized for illegal transportation of sand. The applicant, who is the registered owner of the vehicle, sought interim custody of the vehicle. The court directed that the vehicle be released on supurdiginama subject to certain conditions.

The first condition was that the applicant furnish a personal bond and a bank guarantee. This is a common requirement in cases where a vehicle has been seized by the authorities. The bond and guarantee serve as a form of security, ensuring that the vehicle will not be used for any illegal activities while it is in the custody of the applicant.

The second condition was that the applicant provide an undertaking not to transfer ownership or allow the vehicle to be used in any anti-social activities. This is also a standard requirement in cases like this, as it helps to prevent the vehicle from being used for any illegal purposes.

The court also directed the applicant to produce the original registration and sale-letter. This is important because it helps to establish the ownership of the vehicle and ensures that it is not being used by someone who does not have the legal right to do so.

Finally, the court ordered that the applicant get the vehicle photographed in the presence of a responsible officer. This is to ensure that the condition of the vehicle is properly documented and that any damage or changes to the vehicle can be easily identified.

Overall, the court order was designed to ensure that the vehicle is not used for any illegal activities while it is in the custody of the applicant. The conditions imposed by the court are standard in cases like this and are intended to protect the interests of all parties involved.

It is worth noting that the order was sent to the trial court for compliance. This means that the trial court will be responsible for ensuring that the conditions imposed by the court are met and that the vehicle is properly cared for while it is in the custody of the applicant.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is a standard one that is designed to protect the interests of all parties involved. The conditions imposed by the court are intended to ensure that the vehicle is not used for any illegal activities and that it is properly cared for while it is in the custody of the applicant. The order will now be sent to the trial court for compliance, and it is up to that court to ensure that the conditions are met.
