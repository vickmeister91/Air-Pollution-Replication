In a criminal trial where the petitioner was the second accused, they filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to send for certain documents from the police station. However, the government advocate opposed this request, citing Section 172 Cr.P.C. which states that police diaries cannot be called for by the accused or their agents. The court upheld the government advocate's argument and dismissed the revision petition.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal provisions related to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials. Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, this power is subject to certain limitations, including the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C.

Section 172 Cr.P.C. deals with the maintenance of police diaries and provides that every police officer in charge of a police station shall maintain a diary in the prescribed form, in which they shall record all daily occurrences and proceedings in relation to the police station. The section further provides that such diaries shall be used only for the purposes of investigation or inquiry into any offence and shall not be called for by any court or any other authority.

In the present case, the petitioner sought to call for certain documents from the police station under Section 91 Cr.P.C. However, the government advocate opposed this request, citing the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. The court agreed with the government advocate's argument and dismissed the revision petition.

The court's decision is in line with the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. which clearly state that police diaries cannot be called for by any court or any other authority. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that police officers are able to maintain accurate and complete records of daily occurrences and proceedings in relation to the police station without fear of interference or tampering.

It is important for litigants and their advocates to be aware of the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. and other relevant legal provisions when seeking to call for documents or other evidence in criminal trials. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of their petitions or applications, as in the present case.

In conclusion, the court's decision to dismiss the revision petition highlights the importance of understanding the legal provisions related to the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials. While Section 91 Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, this power is subject to certain limitations, including the provisions of Section 172 Cr.P.C. which prohibit the calling for of police diaries by any court or other authority. It is therefore important for litigants and their advocates to be aware of these provisions and other relevant legal provisions when seeking to call for documents or other evidence in criminal trials.
