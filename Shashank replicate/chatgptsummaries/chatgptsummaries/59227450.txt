The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Smt. Nirmala Devi against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to all affected villages by transporting drinking water. The case was adjourned to March 20, 2015.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and analyze them for contamination. The report reveals that the samples of water from the distributories could not be collected due to ongoing maintenance work, but the analysis reports of the water samples drawn from the clean water reservoir are normal. The court directs the SPCB to collect water samples upstream and downstream of the distributories to determine the standard of water running through them. The state is directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the banks of the distributories and canal within a given time frame. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs the state/local authorities to recover the same from such person by invoking polluter pays principle. The court also directs citizens to be made aware of this direction through publication of notices on Boards at prominent places, in news as well as on radio and T.V media. The court orders the District Collector, Ganga Nagar to be present with all the relevant records on the next date of hearing.

The National Green Tribunal issued an order in October 2015 to remove encroachments in Sriganganagar and other areas, and a committee was formed to monitor the removal of encroachments. The State Government was directed to issue notices to those causing pollution and to remove existing structures in the area meant for maintenance of the canal. However, the compliance report filed by the State Government did not disclose the number of encroachers who obtained interim relief by way of stay orders. The Tribunal ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month and directed various officials to provide assistance and monitor the removal. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. A compliance report was to be filed by January 29, 2016. However, on December 4, 2015, the Tribunal observed that no effective action had been taken against the remaining encroachers and ordered the removal of all encroachments within one month. The State Government was also directed to issue notices to those contributing to pollution and to comply with the directions in letter and spirit. A compliance report was to be filed by January 29, 2016.

The court order discusses the lack of compliance with directions issued by the Tribunal regarding the removal of encroachments and collection of compensation from encroachers. The District Collector is directed to appear before the Tribunal with relevant information and records. The court suggests that aggrieved parties should approach the NGT for relief since the State Authorities are taking action pursuant to the directions given by the NGT. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching writ court and the circumstances under which it may be ignored.

The court order states that the original applicant's petition is barred by limitation and the issue has not been decided yet. The court has the discretion to insist on alternative remedies even if it concludes that the order passed by the subordinate court or tribunal lacks jurisdiction. The case is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which has the power to condone the delay. The remedy provided under the Act of 2010 is before the Supreme Court of India. The writ petition is dismissed, and the petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
