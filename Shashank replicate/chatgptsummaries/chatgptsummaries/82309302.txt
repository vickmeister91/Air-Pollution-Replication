The Delhi High Court has taken a significant step towards reducing air pollution in the National Capital Region by issuing an order to prevent the burning of agricultural waste. The court has directed all states to strictly implement notifications and directions banning the burning of crop residue and to file weekly reports of prosecutions launched to prevent burning. This move is expected to reduce the amount of air pollution caused by the burning of agricultural waste, which is a major contributor to the poor air quality in Delhi and the surrounding areas.

The court order also directs state governments to issue orders to companies and public undertakings involved in manufacturing to collect crop residue from farmers and provide them with money as consideration. This is a positive step towards incentivizing farmers to stop burning their crop residue and instead sell it to companies and public undertakings. This will not only reduce air pollution but also provide an additional source of income for farmers.

The Graded Response Action Plan issued under a notification dated 12.01.2017 must also be strictly implemented. This plan outlines a series of measures to be taken in response to different levels of air pollution. By strictly implementing this plan, the government can take proactive steps to reduce air pollution and protect the health of citizens.

The court order also requires the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change to obtain weekly reports from the Special Committees established by each state. This will help to ensure that the states are complying with the court order and taking the necessary steps to reduce air pollution. The Union of India will also monitor the sites where agricultural waste is found to have been burnt by satellite tracking. This will help to identify areas where burning is still taking place and take action to prevent it.

The court order also encourages the replication of initiatives being followed in certain districts in other districts in other states. This will help to spread best practices and ensure that effective measures are being taken to reduce air pollution across the country. The states concerned are also required to inform the public of protective measures to be taken to safeguard their health. This will help to raise awareness about the dangers of air pollution and encourage citizens to take steps to protect themselves.

All states, the Govt. of NCT of Delhi and the Union of India, shall file brief affidavits disclosing the measures taken to comply with the above order before the next date of hearing. The GNCTD, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, local bodies of Delhi, and the National Thermal Power Corporation shall file the latest status report through separate affidavits. The cases will be listed for further directions on October 16, 2017.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's order to prevent the burning of agricultural waste is a positive step towards reducing air pollution in the National Capital Region. By directing all states to strictly implement notifications and directions banning the burning of crop residue and incentivizing companies and public undertakings to collect crop residue from farmers, the court has taken a proactive step towards reducing air pollution. The court's order to strictly implement the Graded Response Action Plan and monitor the sites where agricultural waste is found to have been burnt by satellite tracking will also help to ensure that effective measures are being taken to reduce air pollution. The court's order to replicate initiatives being followed in certain districts in other districts in other states and inform the public of protective measures to be taken to safeguard their health will also help to raise awareness about the dangers of air pollution and encourage citizens to take steps to protect themselves.
