The provision is intended to protect a person from harassment and humiliation that may result from arrest. The provision is available to a person who has reason to believe that he may be arrested for a non-bailable offense.

The provision of anticipatory bail is not an absolute right. The court may grant anticipatory bail subject to certain conditions. The conditions may include the requirement to cooperate with the investigation, not to leave the country without the permission of the court, and to attend court hearings as and when required.

The provision of anticipatory bail is intended to protect a person's liberty and dignity. The court's decision ensures that the applicants are not subjected to harassment and humiliation that may result from arrest.
