In a recent court order, the petitioner, who claims to be the owner of a car, sought interim release of the vehicle under section 451 of Cr.P.C. The vehicle in question was allegedly used for carrying snake venom and other articles, which is an offense under section 39 (d) of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, ordered the interim release of the vehicle to the petitioner on certain conditions.

The court observed that the petitioner had claimed ownership of the vehicle and had produced relevant documents to support his claim. The court also noted that the vehicle had been seized by the authorities in connection with an offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. However, the court held that the ownership of the vehicle was not relevant to the question of interim release, and that the petitioner was entitled to seek interim release of the vehicle under section 451 of Cr.P.C.

The court then considered the question of whether the vehicle could be released on interim basis, given that it had been allegedly used for carrying snake venom and other articles in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The court noted that the offense under section 39 (d) of the Act was a non-bailable offense, and that the vehicle was an article used in the commission of the offense. However, the court held that the mere fact that the vehicle had been used in the commission of the offense did not automatically disentitle the petitioner from seeking interim release of the vehicle.

The court then proceeded to impose certain conditions for the interim release of the vehicle. The petitioner was required to furnish a bank guarantee for the value of the vehicle, and was also required to undertake not to use the vehicle for any offense under the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 while the vehicle was in custody. The court also directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigating authorities and to produce the vehicle whenever required by the authorities.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner sought interim release of a vehicle that had been allegedly used for carrying snake venom and other articles in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972. The court, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, ordered the interim release of the vehicle to the petitioner on certain conditions, including the furnishing of a bank guarantee and undertaking not to use the vehicle for any such offense while in custody. The court also directed the petitioner to cooperate with the investigating authorities and to produce the vehicle whenever required by the authorities.
