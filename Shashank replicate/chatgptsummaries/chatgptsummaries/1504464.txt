The Allahabad High Court recently received petitions from Ramesh Chandra and others to quash proceedings pending before the City Magistrate in Bareilly. The petitioners were engaged in the business of preparing "RAAB," which caused air pollution due to the operation of Sheera Bhatti and the use of husk of paddy and khoi of sugarcane as fuel. The Pollution Control Board had issued a notice under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the City Magistrate initiated separate proceedings under Section 133, Cr. P.C. against the applicants. The applicants filed separate revisions before the Sessions Judge, Bareilly, but the judge dismissed the revision. The applicants then filed separate applications under Section 482, Cr. P.C. to quash the proceedings under Section 133, Cr. P.C. pending before the City Magistrate.

The court disposed of all the petitions with a direction that the learned Magistrate shall dispose of the proceeding at an early date considering the cause shown by the applicants. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioners had shown cause for quashing the proceedings. The court also noted that the petitioners had already taken steps to reduce pollution by installing a chimney and a filter. The court further observed that the petitioners had been in the business for a long time and had been paying taxes regularly. The court, therefore, directed the Magistrate to dispose of the proceedings at an early date, taking into account the cause shown by the petitioners.
