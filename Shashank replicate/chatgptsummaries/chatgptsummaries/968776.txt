The first court order involves a dispute over a mortgage of land. The plaintiff claimed to be the legal representative of the deceased mortgagor and brought a suit for redemption of the mortgage. However, the suit was dismissed on the grounds that the mortgage was not proved to be genuine. The plaintiff then brought a second suit for redemption of a portion of the land based on a different mortgage, which the defendants denied was subsisting. The District Munsif decreed redemption in favor of the plaintiff, but the District Judge dismissed the suit on the grounds of res judicata.

The plaintiff appealed, arguing that the present suit was not barred by Section 43 or Explanation II to Section 13 of the Civil Procedure Code. The court found in favor of the plaintiff and remanded the case for disposal on the merits. The court clarified that the phrase "subjects in dispute" in Section 42 refers to the jural relation between the parties, and not to all possible claims to the same object matter. The court also emphasized that Section 43 requires the whole claim arising out of the cause of action to be included in the suit to avoid splitting of claims arising out of the same cause of action.

The second court order discusses the principle of res judicata, which means that a court's judgment on a matter is final and cannot be challenged again in a subsequent case. The order cites various cases and sections of the Civil Procedure Code to explain the scope and limitations of res judicata. The order also discusses the difference between a cause of action and a matter directly and substantially in issue, and how they relate to res judicata. Overall, the order provides a detailed analysis of the law of res judicata in India.

The third court order discusses the concept of res judicata, which means that a matter that has been adjudicated by a competent court cannot be pursued further by the same parties. The court clarifies that if a plaintiff fails to establish their title in a suit, they cannot reserve some grounds for a future suit. However, if a plaintiff seeks to redeem a specific mortgage or eject on a specific lease and fails in such a suit, they are not precluded from seeking to redeem the same property or a portion thereof from another specific mortgage or to eject on the strength of their title the person in possession. The court also discusses various cases that have been cited in support of the respondent's plea of res judicata and explains why they do not apply in the present case. Ultimately, the court allows the second appeal and remands the case to the Lower Appellate Court for disposal on the merits.

In all three court orders, the concept of res judicata is discussed. Res judicata is a fundamental principle of law that prevents parties from re-litigating issues that have already been decided by a court. The orders clarify that if a plaintiff fails to establish their title in a suit, they cannot reserve some grounds for a future suit. However, if a plaintiff seeks to redeem a specific mortgage or eject on a specific lease and fails in such a suit, they are not precluded from seeking to redeem the same property or a portion thereof from another specific mortgage or to eject on the strength of their title the person in possession.

The orders also clarify that Section 43 of the Civil Procedure Code requires the whole claim arising out of the cause of action to be included in the suit to avoid splitting of claims arising out of the same cause of action. The court emphasizes that the phrase "subjects in dispute" in Section 42 refers to the jural relation between the parties, and not to all possible claims to the same object matter.

Overall, the court orders provide a detailed analysis of the law of res judicata in India and clarify the scope and limitations of the principle. They also provide guidance on how to avoid splitting of claims arising out of the same cause of action and emphasize the importance of including the whole claim in a suit.
