In a recent court order, Raju was granted bail after being arrested on 24 May 2018 in connection with a wildlife protection case. The applicant's counsel argued that Raju was falsely implicated in the case and that no further custodial interrogation was required as the investigation was complete and the charge sheet had already been filed. The court allowed the bail application on the condition that Raju furnishes a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and two solvent sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court/committal court concerned. The court also directed Raju to remain present on each and every date of the trial and abide by all the terms and conditions enumerated under Section 437 (3) of Cr.P.C.

The court's decision to grant bail to Raju was based on the argument put forth by his counsel that he was falsely implicated in the case. This argument was supported by the fact that the investigation was complete and the charge sheet had already been filed. The court also took into consideration the fact that Raju had no prior criminal record and was not a flight risk.

However, the court did impose certain conditions on Raju's bail. He was required to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 1,00,000/- and two solvent sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the trial court/committal court concerned. This was done to ensure that Raju would appear in court on each and every date of the trial. The court also directed Raju to abide by all the terms and conditions enumerated under Section 437 (3) of Cr.P.C.

Section 437 (3) of Cr.P.C. lays down the conditions that must be followed by a person who has been granted bail. These conditions include appearing in court on each and every date of the trial, not leaving the country without the permission of the court, not tampering with evidence or witnesses, and not committing any offence while on bail.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Raju was based on the fact that he was falsely implicated in the case and that the investigation was complete. However, the court did impose certain conditions on his bail to ensure that he would appear in court on each and every date of the trial and abide by all the terms and conditions enumerated under Section 437 (3) of Cr.P.C.
