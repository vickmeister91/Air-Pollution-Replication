The World Renewal Spiritual Trust recently filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order FIR No.2064/35 dated 18.10.2017. The petitioner was supposed to appear as a witness in FIR No.2064/35, which was registered for the offence under Section 34-A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner's counsel submitted that as per Section 34-A, once the petitioner was only called as a witness, no action could have been initiated under Section 34-A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The court directed the respondents to adhere to the procedure laid down by the statute under Section 34-A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 before taking any action against the petitioner. This means that the respondents must follow the proper legal procedure before taking any action against the petitioner. The court's decision is based on the fact that the petitioner was only called as a witness and not as an accused in the case.

Section 34-A of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 states that any person who is called as a witness in a case under this Act shall be bound to attend the court and give evidence. However, no action can be taken against such a person under this Act. This means that if a person is called as a witness in a case under this Act, they cannot be charged or punished for any offence under this Act.

The court's decision in this case is important because it upholds the rights of witnesses in cases under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. Witnesses play a crucial role in any legal proceeding, and it is important that their rights are protected. The court's decision ensures that witnesses are not unfairly targeted or punished for their role in a case.

In conclusion, the court's decision in this case is a positive step towards protecting the rights of witnesses in cases under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court's direction to the respondents to follow the proper legal procedure before taking any action against the petitioner is a clear indication that the court is committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served.
