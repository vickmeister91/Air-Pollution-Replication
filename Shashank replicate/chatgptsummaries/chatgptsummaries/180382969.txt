The court order in question pertains to a criminal case against the petitioner, who was the third accused in a forest offence case. The first and second accused were convicted, but their appeals were allowed, and they were acquitted. The petitioner filed a petition for quashing the proceedings against him, citing the acquittal of the co-accused. The court, after examining the evidence and the judgment, concluded that the substratum of the prosecution case had been shattered by the acquittal of the co-accused and quashed the proceedings against the petitioner.

The case in question involved a forest offence, and the petitioner was the third accused in the case. The first and second accused were convicted, but their appeals were allowed, and they were acquitted. The petitioner then filed a petition for quashing the proceedings against him, citing the acquittal of the co-accused. The court examined the evidence and the judgment and concluded that the substratum of the prosecution case had been shattered by the acquittal of the co-accused.

The court's decision to quash the proceedings against the petitioner was based on the fact that the prosecution's case had been weakened by the acquittal of the co-accused. The court found that the evidence against the petitioner was not strong enough to stand on its own, and that the acquittal of the co-accused had undermined the prosecution's case. As a result, the court concluded that the proceedings against the petitioner should be quashed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of strong evidence in criminal cases. Without strong evidence, it can be difficult for the prosecution to make a case against the accused. In this case, the acquittal of the co-accused weakened the prosecution's case against the petitioner, and ultimately led to the quashing of the proceedings against him.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of evidence in criminal cases. Without strong evidence, it can be difficult for the prosecution to make a case against the accused, and the case may ultimately be quashed. As such, it is important for prosecutors to ensure that they have strong evidence before proceeding with a case, and for defendants to ensure that they have a strong defense.
