The court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Ramveer Jatav in connection with a case registered against him for offences punishable under Sections 452 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court allowed the application and directed that Jatav be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The court also imposed certain conditions on Jatav, including cooperating in the investigation/trial, not committing a similar offence, not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial, and marking his attendance at the concerned police station once every week until the conclusion of the investigation.

The case against Jatav pertains to alleged offences under Sections 452 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. Section 452 of the Indian Penal Code deals with house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint, while Section 323 deals with punishment for voluntarily causing hurt. Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act deals with punishment for hunting or destroying any wild animal or bird.

Jatav had filed an application for anticipatory bail in the court, seeking protection from arrest in connection with the case. The court, after hearing the arguments of both the parties, allowed the application and directed that Jatav be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 25,000 each.

However, the court also imposed certain conditions on Jatav, which he would have to comply with in order to continue to enjoy the protection of the bail order. These conditions include cooperating in the investigation/trial, not committing a similar offence, not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial, and marking his attendance at the concerned police station once every week until the conclusion of the investigation.

The condition of cooperating in the investigation/trial is particularly important, as it requires Jatav to provide all necessary assistance to the investigating agency in order to help them gather evidence and build a strong case against him. Failure to comply with this condition could result in the cancellation of the bail order and Jatav being taken into custody.

Similarly, the condition of not committing a similar offence is also important, as it requires Jatav to refrain from engaging in any activity that could be construed as a violation of the law. This condition is aimed at ensuring that Jatav does not repeat the same offence for which he has been granted bail.

The condition of not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial is also significant, as it is aimed at ensuring that the trial proceeds smoothly and without any unnecessary delays. This condition is aimed at preventing Jatav from using delaying tactics in order to prolong the trial and avoid a speedy resolution of the case.

Finally, the condition of marking his attendance at the concerned police station once every week until the conclusion of the investigation is also important, as it requires Jatav to remain in touch with the investigating agency and provide them with any information or assistance that they may require. This condition is aimed at ensuring that Jatav remains available for questioning and does not abscond or evade the investigation.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by Ramveer Jatav in connection with a case registered against him for offences punishable under Sections 452 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act. The court allowed the application and directed that Jatav be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 with two solvent sureties of Rs. 25,000 each. The court also imposed certain conditions on Jatav, including cooperating in the investigation/trial, not committing a similar offence, not seeking unnecessary adjournments during the trial, and marking his attendance at the concerned police station once every week until the conclusion of the investigation. These conditions are aimed at ensuring that Jatav complies with the law and does not engage in any activity that could be construed as a violation of the law. Failure to comply with these conditions could result in the cancellation of the bail order and Jatav being taken into custody.
