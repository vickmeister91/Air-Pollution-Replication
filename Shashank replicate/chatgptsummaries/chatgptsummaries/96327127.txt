The court order pertains to a case where owners of stone crushers in Rajasthan challenged two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (the Board) in 2010. The petitioners claimed that they had been running their units in accordance with the requirements of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and according to the conditions imposed by the Board. However, the Board had issued notices pointing out deficiencies and threatening to revoke their consent to operate. The petitioners had filed writ petitions before the High Court, which had allowed the petitions and remitted the matter to the Board for deciding afresh. The Board had subsequently refused to grant consent to the petitioners and directed them to close their units. The petitioners had again approached the High Court, which heard arguments on the maintainability of the petitions.

The court observed that the Board was empowered to inspect and issue directions to prevent, control or abate air pollution. The court also noted that the Act made a distinction between an order passed by the Board and the directions issued by it. While Section 31 of the Act provided a right to file an appeal against an order, the said Section did not provide the right to file an appeal against the directions issued under Section 31A of the Act. The court held that the existence of an alternative remedy was not an absolute bar to a person approaching the High Court under its writ jurisdiction. In case an order had been passed in violation of principles of natural justice, then the aggrieved party would be entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. The court observed that the impugned orders were non-speaking orders and violated the principles of natural justice. Hence, the petitioners were justified in invoking the writ jurisdiction of the court.

The court order discusses the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the powers of the State Board to inspect and give directions to prevent air pollution. The court rejects the State Board's argument that the petitioners had a right to file an appeal against directions issued under Section 31A of the Act in the impugned order dated 04.02.2010. The court also discusses the violation of principles of natural justice and fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution of India by the Board. The court concludes that the writ petitions are maintainable and upholds the contentions of the petitioners.

The court order discusses the legal requirements for granting consent to operate industrial plants in air pollution control areas under Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. The court finds that the Board did not follow the prescribed procedure for renewing the consent order for a stone crusher unit and that the notice given to the unit was vague and did not provide sufficient information for the unit to respond. The court concludes that the impugned orders passed by the Board are legally unsustainable and invalid.

The court order grants a specified period for the State Board to refuse consent to an industry that has defaulted in complying with the provisions of the Air Act or has inadequate pollution control measures. The court found that the stone crusher was lacking in pollution control measures during an inspection and that the Board did not provide evidence that the deficiencies were not corrected. The court quashed and set aside the impugned orders but directed the Board to consider the applications for renewal of consent and issue temporary consent for one month while inspecting the sites and collecting air samples. The State Government is directed to constitute a committee to advise on declaring areas of the State as Stone Crushers Zones.

The court has ordered the formation of a committee consisting of members from the Rajasthan Pollution Control Board, Principal Secretary Revenue, and CMD of RIICO to advise the government on declaring areas of the state as Stone Crushers Zones. The committee must submit its recommendations within three months, and the state must consider and pass necessary orders within one month of receiving the recommendations. The Deputy Registrar (Judicial) is directed to send a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretary for immediate implementation. The writ petitions have been disposed of with these directions.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where stone crusher owners in Rajasthan challenged two orders passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The court observed that the Board was empowered to inspect and issue directions to prevent, control or abate air pollution. The court held that the existence of an alternative remedy was not an absolute bar to a person approaching the High Court under its writ jurisdiction.
