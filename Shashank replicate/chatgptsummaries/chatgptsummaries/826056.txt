The court order in question pertains to a substance called Ambergris, which is formed in the intestine of a sperm whale. The Chief Wild Life Warden challenged an order passed by the learned C.J.M. in Misc. Case No. 3/1985, which arose from an application filed by the O.P. for the return of the seized Ambergris. The court found that it was necessary to determine whether the Ambergris was an uncured trophy or a trophy within the meaning of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court noted that the concession made by the learned A.P.P. was not binding on the petitioner. The court ultimately set aside the order dismissing the petition of complaint and sent it back to the learned C.J.M. for further proceedings. This decision was based on the fact that the court needed to determine whether the Ambergris was an uncured trophy or a trophy within the meaning of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a piece of legislation that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It defines a trophy as any part of an animal that is kept as a hunting trophy, and it is illegal to possess or trade in such trophies. The Act also prohibits the hunting of certain species of animals, including sperm whales.

In this case, the court needed to determine whether the Ambergris was a trophy within the meaning of the Act. The court noted that the Ambergris was seized from the petitioner, and the petitioner claimed that it was not a trophy within the meaning of the Act. The court found that it was necessary to determine whether the Ambergris was an uncured trophy or a trophy within the meaning of the Act.

The court noted that the learned C.J.M. had dismissed the petition of complaint on the basis of a concession made by the learned A.P.P. The court found that this concession was not binding on the petitioner, and that the court needed to determine whether the Ambergris was a trophy within the meaning of the Act.

The court ultimately set aside the order dismissing the petition of complaint and sent it back to the learned C.J.M. for further proceedings. The court noted that it was necessary to determine whether the Ambergris was an uncured trophy or a trophy within the meaning of the Act, and that this determination would require further evidence.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a piece of Ambergris seized from the petitioner. The court found that it was necessary to determine whether the Ambergris was an uncured trophy or a trophy within the meaning of the Wild Life Protection Act. The court set aside the order dismissing the petition of complaint and sent it back to the learned C.J.M. for further proceedings.
