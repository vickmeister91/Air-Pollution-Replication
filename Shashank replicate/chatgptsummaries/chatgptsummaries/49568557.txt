The Delhi Rent Control Act is a legislation that regulates the relationship between landlords and tenants in the city of Delhi. It provides for the control of rents, eviction of tenants, and other related matters. In this context, two court orders were issued in relation to cases filed under Section 14 (1) (a) of the Act. 

The first case involved a petitioner who had purchased a property and the respondent was a tenant in a portion of the property. The petitioner claimed that the respondent had not paid rent since the purchase of the property and was liable to pay enhanced rent. The respondent, on the other hand, claimed that she had paid rent to the previous owner until 2005 and subsequently sent rent by money order until 2007. 

The court found that the relationship of landlady and tenant was admitted and that the respondent had not paid rent for November and December 2004. The court ordered the respondent to pay the arrears of rent and enhanced rent as per the provisions of the Delhi Rent Control Act. This order highlights the importance of maintaining proper records of rent payments and the need for tenants to pay rent on time. 

The second case involved a respondent who had not paid rent since September 2004. The respondent claimed to have paid rent by money order to the previous owner until August 2007, and then deposited rent in court from September 2007 to September 2009. However, there was no evidence of rent payment for March and April 2007, and it was unclear if rent for 2008 was paid. 

The petitioner had proved their case for eviction due to non-payment of rent, but the respondent was given a chance to pay arrears of rent within one month. The case would be considered for benefit under section 14(2) of the Delhi Rent Control Act. This order highlights the importance of tenants keeping proper records of rent payments and the need for landlords to follow the legal process for eviction. 

In both cases, the court orders emphasize the importance of maintaining proper records of rent payments and the need for tenants to pay rent on time. The Delhi Rent Control Act provides for the protection of both landlords and tenants, and it is important for both parties to understand their rights and obligations under the Act. 

Landlords must follow the legal process for eviction and cannot evict tenants without a valid reason. Tenants must pay rent on time and maintain proper records of rent payments to avoid legal disputes. The court orders in these cases serve as a reminder of the importance of following the legal process and maintaining proper records in landlord-tenant relationships.
