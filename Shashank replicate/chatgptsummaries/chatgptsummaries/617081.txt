The Karnataka High Court recently received a criminal petition from M/S P Balasubba Shetty and Sons, seeking to quash proceedings initiated by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) against them. The petitioners argued that the complainant had been urged by the KSPCB to withdraw the complaint and challenged the locus standi of the complainant. However, the court found no grounds to entertain the petition and dismissed it.

The case involved allegations of pollution caused by M/S P Balasubba Shetty and Sons, a company engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling of areca nut products. The KSPCB had initiated proceedings against the company under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The company had challenged these proceedings before the High Court, arguing that the complainant had no locus standi to file the complaint and that the KSPCB had urged the complainant to withdraw the complaint.

The court examined the arguments put forth by the petitioners and found no merit in them. The court held that the complainant had the necessary locus standi to file the complaint, as they were a resident of the area affected by the alleged pollution. The court also noted that the KSPCB had not urged the complainant to withdraw the complaint, and that the complainant had filed an affidavit stating that they had not been coerced or influenced in any manner.

The court further observed that the allegations made by the petitioners were serious in nature and required a thorough investigation. The court noted that the KSPCB had conducted an inspection of the premises of the company and had found evidence of pollution. The court held that the KSPCB had the necessary powers to initiate proceedings against the company under the relevant environmental laws.

The court also noted that the petitioners had not challenged the findings of the KSPCB inspection report, and had not provided any evidence to rebut the allegations of pollution. The court held that the petitioners had failed to make out a case for quashing the proceedings initiated by the KSPCB.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court dismissed the criminal petition filed by M/S P Balasubba Shetty and Sons, seeking to quash proceedings initiated by the KSPCB against them. The court held that the complainant had the necessary locus standi to file the complaint and that the KSPCB had the necessary powers to initiate proceedings against the company under the relevant environmental laws.
