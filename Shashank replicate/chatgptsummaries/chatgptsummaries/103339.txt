The Kolleru Lake in Andhra Pradesh has been facing pollution and encroachment issues due to prawn culture, aquaculture, and industrial/municipal effluents. The court order involves multiple writ petitions related to the protection of the lake. The writ petitions seek relief in the form of declaring government notifications illegal, arbitrary, and violative of constitutional rights, and to restore the lake to its pristine glory.

The court examines the constitutional provisions and environmental laws related to the protection of lakes and wildlife. The history and ecological significance of Kolleru Lake are also discussed. The court acknowledges the lake's importance as a wetland of international significance and the need to preserve and protect it. The court orders the Pollution Control Board to regulate or stop activities that contribute to the pollution of the lake.

The court order pertains to the constitution of Kolleru Wildlife Sanctuary under Section 26-A of the Act, which has been challenged by various petitioners. The court has found that the procedure adopted for fixing the boundaries of the sanctuary was contrary to the provisions of the Act and that no scientific survey was conducted. The court has also noted that the D-form pattas granted to landless poor cannot be cancelled after three decades and that the livelihood of people residing in the area has been affected. The court has directed the government to take steps to stop pollution and preserve the lake.

The court has also clarified that even pattedars shall not be allowed to continue with fishing operations if final notification has been issued under Section 26-A of the Act. The court has further directed the government to take remedial steps to prohibit aquaculture and agriculture below plus 5 contour and remove obstructions on vent ways in the water course of Kolleru lake. Traditional fishing methods are allowed, and those who wish to engage in aquaculture must file applications with the appropriate authority if their lands are outside the sanctuary area.

The court order discusses the issue of nullity in relation to the notification under Section 18 of the Act, which fixed the Mean Sea Level at 5 MSL for Kolleru lake. The learned Counsel argues that the appropriate authority did not take the necessary steps to arrive at this decision and did not give the affected party an opportunity to be heard. The court also discusses the relevant provisions of the Environment Act, Water Act, and Wild Life Act, which deal with the protection of the environment, prevention of water pollution, and protection of wild animals and plants. The court notes that Kolleru lake has been polluted due to discharge of industrial and municipal pollutants, as well as prawn and fish culture. The court also mentions the importance of sustainable development and the need to implement standards for the maintenance of ecology in relation to lakes.

The court order discusses the declaration of the Kolleru Wildlife Sanctuary under the Wild Life (Protection) Act and the subsequent prohibition of fish and prawn culture in the area. The court held that the rights of the local fishermen to do fishing by traditional methods have not been taken away, but aquaculture in the form of any tank has been prohibited. The final notification has taken sufficient safeguards to protect the interest of the people who are surviving on traditional methods of fishing. The court also directed the government to take adequate steps to stop and regulate effluents discharged from industries and municipalities into Kolleru lake and strictly adhere to the standards laid down by the Ministry of Environment for the preservation and maintenance of the lake and ecology.

The court has ordered the state to take necessary steps to restore Kolleru Lake to its original state and prohibit any form of aquaculture or shrimp culture within the sanctuary. The state must also remove any encroachments on the lake bed area. No costs have been ordered.

In conclusion, the court order aims to protect the Kolleru Lake and its ecosystem from pollution and encroachment. The court has directed the government to take necessary steps to stop pollution and preserve the lake. The court has also clarified that traditional fishing methods are allowed, but aquaculture in the form of any tank has been prohibited.
