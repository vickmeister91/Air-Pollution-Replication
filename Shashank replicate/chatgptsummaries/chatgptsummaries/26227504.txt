The Patna High Court recently issued an order regarding a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that was filed regarding 26 marriage halls causing pollution in Motihari Town. The court ordered that the PIL be listed on 29.02.2016 and directed newly impleaded respondents to be served notices. Additionally, the court dispensed with the personal appearance of the Collector-cum-District Magistrate, East Champaran, until further orders.

During the hearing, various parties made submissions to the court. The court granted time for a supplementary counter affidavit to be filed. The case is ongoing, and further updates will be provided as they become available.

The issue of pollution caused by marriage halls is a serious concern in many parts of India. These halls are often located in residential areas and generate a significant amount of noise and air pollution. In addition, they often generate large amounts of waste, which can lead to environmental degradation.

The PIL filed in this case seeks to address these issues and hold those responsible for the pollution accountable. The Patna High Court's decision to hear the case and issue orders is a positive step towards addressing this important issue.

It is important to note that the court's decision to dispense with the personal appearance of the Collector-cum-District Magistrate, East Champaran, until further orders does not mean that the official is exempt from responsibility. Rather, it simply means that the court has decided that the official's presence is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings.

Overall, the Patna High Court's order regarding the PIL on marriage hall pollution in Motihari Town is a positive development in the ongoing effort to address environmental issues in India. It is important that all parties involved continue to work towards finding a solution to this problem and ensuring that those responsible for the pollution are held accountable.
