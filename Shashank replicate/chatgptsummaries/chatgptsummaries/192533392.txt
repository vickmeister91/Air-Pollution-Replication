The National Insurance Company filed a Civil Miscellaneous Appeal against the judgment and decree passed by the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal in MACT.OP.No.64 of 2000. The case involved a fire accident caused by a tanker lorry driven in a rash and negligent manner, resulting in heavy loss to the properties of the claimant. The Tribunal held the driver of the tanker lorry responsible and directed the insurance company to pay compensation to the claimant. The insurance company filed an appeal against the decision.

The court order discusses a case where a tanker lorry carrying hazardous material caused damage to a property due to a leakage and subsequent fire. The court examines whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the claim petition and whether the driver of the tanker lorry was negligent. The court also considers the liability of the insurance company and the compensation awarded to the claimant. Ultimately, the court upholds the decision of the Tribunal and dismisses the appeal.

The court order states that the owner of a property can file an application for compensation under Section 166 of the Act if direct or proximate damage is caused to their property due to a motor vehicle accident. The court cites a previous case where compensation was claimed for death resulting from an accident involving a petrol tanker and a truck. The court also notes that compensation can be claimed for damages to any property of a third party arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. In the present case, the damage caused to the properties was a direct result of the use of the tanker lorry carrying Acetone, and the owner of the property is entitled to claim damages. The court also addresses the issue of the driver of the lorry not having a valid license to carry hazardous goods and concludes that the insurance company is liable to pay compensation. The court does not interfere with the Tribunal's decision on the quantum of compensation.

The court order confirms a compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- with interest at 7.5% p.a. for damages caused to a thatched house, loss of jewels, food items, electrical items, gas stove, and cash. The insurance company is directed to deposit the entire compensation amount within four weeks, and the Tribunal is directed to transfer the same to the claimant's savings bank account through RTGS within one week. The court finds no reason to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by the Tribunal.

In summary, the court order pertains to a case where a tanker lorry carrying hazardous material caused damage to a property due to a leakage and subsequent fire. The court examines the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain the claim petition and the liability of the insurance company. The court confirms the compensation awarded by the Tribunal and directs the insurance company to deposit the amount within four weeks. The court also addresses the issue of the driver of the lorry not having a valid license to carry hazardous goods and concludes that the insurance company is liable to pay compensation. Overall, the court upholds the decision of the Tribunal and dismisses the appeal filed by the insurance company.
