The court order in question relates to a request for modification of a sentence passed in a criminal revision application. The applicant had requested that the sentence be converted from simple imprisonment to rigorous imprisonment, citing the benefits of being able to work and earn money in jail. However, the court rejected the application, stating that it did not have the power to modify the sentence and that there were no cogent reasons to find fault with the nature of punishment imposed by the lower court. Therefore, the application was rejected.

The case at hand involved a criminal revision application in which the applicant had been sentenced to simple imprisonment. The applicant had requested that the sentence be converted to rigorous imprisonment, citing the benefits of being able to work and earn money in jail. The court, however, rejected the application, stating that it did not have the power to modify the sentence and that there were no cogent reasons to find fault with the nature of punishment imposed by the lower court.

The court's decision was based on several factors. First, the court noted that the power to modify a sentence lies with the appellate court, not the revisional court. As such, the court did not have the power to modify the sentence in question. Second, the court found that there were no cogent reasons to find fault with the nature of punishment imposed by the lower court. The court noted that the lower court had considered all relevant factors in imposing the sentence and had acted within its discretion in doing so.

The court's decision was also influenced by the fact that the applicant had not provided any compelling reasons for the modification of the sentence. The court noted that the applicant had cited the benefits of being able to work and earn money in jail, but had not provided any evidence to support this claim. As such, the court found that the applicant had not provided any compelling reasons for the modification of the sentence.

Overall, the court's decision in this case was based on a careful consideration of the relevant factors. The court noted that it did not have the power to modify the sentence in question and that there were no cogent reasons to find fault with the nature of punishment imposed by the lower court. The court's decision was also influenced by the fact that the applicant had not provided any compelling reasons for the modification of the sentence. As such, the court rejected the application for modification of the sentence.
