The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sarat Kumar Bal and another against the State of Orissa and others. The petitioners challenged the decision of the Member, Board of Revenue, Orissa, Cuttack in O.E.A. Revision No.139 of 2000 under Section 38-B of the Orissa Estate Abolition Act, 1951 annulling the order of the Additional Tahasildar-cum-OEA Collector, Sukinda passed in OEA Lease Case No. 69/77 dated 9.2.78/15.2.78 and directing to restore the land to the Government by recording the same in the Government khata.

The court examined the case records and found that the O.E.A. Collector had settled the land in favour of late Gopinath Bal in O.E.A. Lease Case No. 69/77 without proper documentation. The land was classified as "Anabadi Sala Jungle" and could not be settled under the O.E.A. Act due to the enactment of the Forest Conservation Act. The O.E.A. Collector settled the land without obtaining approval from the Board of Revenue, which was required by the O.E.A. Act. The Member, Board of Revenue, set aside the settlement made in favor of Gopinath Bal by invoking the power under Section 38-B of the O.E.A. Act.

The court also considered the provisions of Sec.61(2) of the Orissa Tenancy Act, 1913 and the cutoff date of "01.01.1946" provided by the O.E.A. Act. The court ultimately ordered that the land be restored to the Government.

The court dismissed the writ petition and stated that the appropriate authority under the provisions of the Orissa Tenancy Act should adjudicate the question of whether the present petitioners have acquired raiyati rights over the disputed land. The court also stated that there was no noncompliance of the principles of natural justice.
