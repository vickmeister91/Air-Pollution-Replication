The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various criminal cases. In the first case, the petitioners filed a criminal misc. petition against the trial court's order dismissing their application for summoning documents. The case involved the death of Geeta, who was married to petitioner No.3 and died under unnatural circumstances while eight months pregnant. The court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to register a regular case and conduct a fair and impartial investigation into the matter. The court found that the investigation carried out so far was inadequate, tainted, and heavily biased in favor of the accused.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a case of unnatural dowry death of a pregnant woman. The investigation was inadequate and tainted, and the accused persons against whom there were specific allegations of harassing and torturing the deceased in relation to demand of dowry were left out from the array of the accused. The court directed the file of the case to be transferred to the CBI for further investigation. The CBI conducted the investigation and filed a charge-sheet against the accused. The petitioners moved an application under section 91 CrPC while praying that the prosecution may be directed to produce the statements of various prosecution witnesses recorded by the Executive Magistrate and the police officials during the investigation conducted in connection with the allegations levelled in the FIR No.113/2012. The said application filed by the petitioners was rejected by the trial court.

The third court order discusses a petition to summon documents for cross-examination during a trial. The petitioners argue that the documents are necessary for contradiction, improvement, and omissions during cross-examination. The court considers the arguments of both parties and ultimately decides that the trial court did not commit any illegality in rejecting the petitioners' application. The court explains that section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers the court to summon documents deemed necessary or desirable for any inquiry or trial. The trial court found that the statements of witnesses recorded by the CBI and other relevant evidence collected by it and filed along with the charge-sheet were sufficient and necessary for the trial. The court concludes that the discretion exercised by the trial court is not liable to be interfered with lightly unless a case of manifest injustice is made out.

In the fourth court order, the court states that the High Court was not justified in indirectly applying the requirements of Section 173(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code to cases instituted on private complaints. The court also states that the High Court should not interfere with the discretion of the trial court in summoning documents, except for very good reasons. The court further explains the requirements for summoning documents under Section 91 of the Code and states that the accused's entitlement to seek an order under Section 91 would ordinarily not come till the stage of defense. The court also discusses the limitations of Section 91 and the stage or point of time of its exercise. Finally, the court mentions a case where an application filed by the accused under Section 91 for summoning and production of documents was dismissed.

In the fifth court order, the court discusses an application filed by the accused under Section 91 of the Code for summoning and production of documents, which was dismissed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court and Supreme Court. The court made observations that if the accused could produce any reliable material that could affect the sustainability of the case, it should not be ignored. However, these observations are of no consequence in this case. The court also clarified that the accused does not have the right to produce any document at the stage of framing of charges. The court emphasized that the jurisdiction under Section 91 of the Code must be seen in the context of the purpose of investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceedings under the Code and that a roving or fishing inquiry is not permitted. The court dismissed the criminal misc. petition and the stay petition.

In summary, these court orders deal with various aspects of criminal cases, including the investigation process, summoning of documents, and the jurisdiction of the court under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court emphasizes the importance of a fair and impartial investigation and the need for evidence to be produced at the appropriate stage of the trial. The court also clarifies the limitations of Section 91 and the discretion of the trial court in summoning documents. Overall, these court orders provide valuable insights into the legal process and the role of the court in ensuring justice is served.
