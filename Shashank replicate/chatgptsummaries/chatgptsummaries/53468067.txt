In a recent court order, the applicants who had filed for regular bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in connection with a case registered against them under the Wild Life Protection Act have been granted bail. However, the court has imposed certain conditions on them that they must comply with, failing which appropriate action will be taken against them.

The applicants have been granted bail on the condition that they execute a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each and provide a solvent surety of the same amount. This is a common practice in criminal cases where the accused is released on bail. The personal bond is a promise made by the accused to the court that they will appear for all future court hearings and comply with all the conditions imposed on them. The solvent surety is a person who guarantees to the court that the accused will comply with the conditions of the bail and will appear for all future court hearings. The surety is usually a close relative or friend of the accused who has sufficient financial means to pay the bail amount in case the accused fails to comply with the conditions.

Apart from the personal bond and the solvent surety, the court has also imposed several other conditions on the applicants. They are not allowed to leave the state of Gujarat without prior permission from the court. This condition is imposed to ensure that the accused do not flee from justice and are available for all future court hearings. The court has also directed the accused to mark their presence before the concerned police station every fortnight. This is a common condition imposed on accused who are released on bail to ensure that they do not abscond and are available for all future court hearings.

The court has warned the accused that any breach of these conditions will result in appropriate action being taken against them. This warning is a reminder to the accused that they must comply with all the conditions imposed on them and failure to do so will result in their bail being cancelled and they will be taken into custody.

The case in question pertains to a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The Wild Life Protection Act is a law enacted by the Indian government to protect wild animals and plants. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants. The act also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and other protected areas for the conservation of wild animals and plants.

In conclusion, the court order granting bail to the applicants in the case registered against them under the Wild Life Protection Act is subject to certain conditions that they must comply with. The conditions include executing a personal bond and providing a solvent surety, not leaving the state of Gujarat without prior permission, and marking their presence before the concerned police station every fortnight. The court has warned the accused that any breach of these conditions will result in appropriate action being taken against them. The Wild Life Protection Act is a law enacted by the Indian government to protect wild animals and plants, and any violation of the act is a serious offense that can result in severe penalties.
