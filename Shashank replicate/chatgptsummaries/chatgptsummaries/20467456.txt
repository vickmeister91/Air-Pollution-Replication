The Kundli-Manesar Expressway project in Haryana, India has been the subject of a court order that has raised concerns among the Consortium of Banks that financed the project. The Court had directed the State of Haryana to replace the existing concessionaire by following due procedure, which has led to the Consortium of Banks filing interlocutory applications seeking direction from the Supreme Court that their rights are not prejudiced by the Court's order dated 30.01.2015 passed in W.P.(C) No.13029 of 1985. The Consortium of Banks has outstanding dues of approximately Rs.1419.15 crores as on 28.02.2015, and they are seeking various directions to protect their rights and ensure that the new concessionaire assumes all the existing liabilities and obligations of the existing concessionaire towards the senior lenders proportionate to 83.320 kms.

The lender banks have raised grievances that Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) did not disclose to the new concessionaire that it would have to take on debts due to the lender banks. The court has ordered that the project funds be deposited into an escrow account and has emphasized the need to protect the interests of the lender banks. The order also discusses delays in the completion of work, termination payments, and ongoing arbitration proceedings.

The court has directed that all disputes be referred to an arbitral tribunal headed by Justice N.K. Sodhi. Pending adjudication of the claims, the court has directed deposit of 80% of the amount collected towards toll for use of Manesar-Palwal section in an escrow account to be opened in IDBI-the lead bank. The said amount shall then be available to the arbitral tribunal for disbursement to the lender banks by way of an interim arrangement or otherwise as it may consider appropriate after hearing the parties. The court has also directed that before ESSEL, the new concessionaire commences the work in Kundli-Manesar, HSIIDC shall appoint a committee of engineers/experts for measurement of the work done by the outgoing concessionaire.

The court order has highlighted the need for transparency and fairness in the awarding of contracts and the management of projects. The lender banks have a legitimate interest in protecting their investments, and the court has recognized this by ordering the deposit of project funds into an escrow account. The court has also emphasized the need to protect the interests of all parties involved in the project, including the new concessionaire and the State of Haryana.
