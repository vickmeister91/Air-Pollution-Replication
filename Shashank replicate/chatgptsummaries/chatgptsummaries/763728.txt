The case in question involves a writ petition filed by a petitioner seeking to quash an order cancelling a special permit for a bus. The petitioner had purchased the vehicle and permit from the original permit holder, but disputes arose between them. The authorities cancelled the permit due to the unauthorized transfer, which is a violation of the Motor Vehicles Act.

The petitioner argued that the cancellation of the permit was arbitrary and illegal, and that the authorities had not followed due process in cancelling the permit. The petitioner also argued that the cancellation of the permit had caused them financial loss and that they were entitled to compensation.

The court, however, dismissed the writ petition, stating that it is not a fit case to be entertained in the exercise of writ jurisdiction. The court held that the relief being sought in the civil court was substantially the same as that sought in the present petition. The court also noted that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court.

The court observed that the petitioner had not challenged the cancellation of the permit before the appellate authority, and that the petitioner had not sought a stay on the cancellation of the permit. The court held that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court, and that the court could not entertain the writ petition in such circumstances.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the cancellation of the permit was arbitrary or illegal. The court held that the authorities had acted within their powers in cancelling the permit, and that the cancellation was justified under the Motor Vehicles Act.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that they were entitled to compensation for the financial loss suffered due to the cancellation of the permit. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for compensation, and that the court could not grant compensation in the absence of evidence to support such a claim.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the writ petition, holding that the relief being sought in the civil court was substantially the same as that sought in the present petition, and that the petitioner had not exhausted all available remedies before approaching the court. The court also held that the petitioner had not produced any evidence to show that the cancellation of the permit was arbitrary or illegal, or that they were entitled to compensation for the financial loss suffered due to the cancellation of the permit.
