Deo Narayan Singh, the petitioner, has filed for anticipatory bail in a case registered against him under sections 33 of Indian Forest Act, Section 33 (c) of the Indian Forest Act (Bihar Amendment), 1989, and Section 2 of Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner is accused of excavating stones from a forest area and fleeing when forest officials arrived. However, the petitioner denies the allegations and is willing to cooperate with the investigation.

The court has granted the petitioner anticipatory bail on the condition that he deposits cash security of Rs. 2000 and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. Additionally, the petitioner is not allowed to enter the forest area during the pendency of the case.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927, is an act that consolidates the law relating to forests, the transit of forest produce, and the duty leviable on timber and other forest produce. Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act deals with the punishment for offences committed under the act. It states that any person who contravenes any of the provisions of the act or any rule made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with a fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or with both.

Section 33 (c) of the Indian Forest Act (Bihar Amendment), 1989, provides for the punishment for the illegal removal of forest produce. It states that any person who removes any forest produce without the permission of the forest officer in charge of the forest or in contravention of any rule made under the act shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with a fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees or with both.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an act that provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Section 2 of the act defines various terms used in the act, including "wild animal," "wild bird," "trophy," and "hunting."

Anticipatory bail is a provision in the Indian legal system that allows a person to seek bail in anticipation of an arrest. It is granted by a court to a person who apprehends arrest in a non-bailable offence. The purpose of anticipatory bail is to protect the person from unnecessary harassment and detention by the police.

In this case, the petitioner has sought anticipatory bail as he fears arrest in connection with the alleged offence. The court has granted him anticipatory bail on the condition that he deposits cash security of Rs. 2000 and furnishes a bail bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the same amount each. The court has also prohibited the petitioner from entering the forest area during the pendency of the case.

The grant of anticipatory bail is not a matter of right, and the court has the discretion to grant or refuse it. The court considers various factors, such as the nature and gravity of the offence, the antecedents of the accused, the possibility of the accused fleeing from justice, and the likelihood of the accused tampering with evidence.

In this case, the court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner after considering the facts and circumstances of the case. The court has also imposed certain conditions to ensure that the petitioner cooperates with the investigation and does not tamper with evidence.

In conclusion, the court has granted anticipatory bail to Deo Narayan Singh in connection with a case registered against him under sections 33 of Indian Forest Act, Section 33 (c) of the Indian Forest Act (Bihar Amendment), 1989, and Section 2 of Wild Life Protection Act.
