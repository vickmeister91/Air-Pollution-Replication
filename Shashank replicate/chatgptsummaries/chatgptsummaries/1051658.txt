In a recent court order, the petitioner, who had been convicted and sentenced for offences under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, was acquitted of all charges. The petitioner's counsel had argued that the prosecution had failed to establish that the articles seized were made up of skins of such lizards or snakes as were enumerated in one or the other Schedules of the Act. The court found that the complaint and evidence did not disclose any offence, and the charge ought not to have been framed.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, is an important piece of legislation that seeks to protect wildlife and their habitats. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also regulates hunting, poaching, and trade in wildlife and their products. The Act has been amended several times over the years to strengthen its provisions and to address emerging challenges in wildlife conservation.

In this particular case, the petitioner had been charged with offences under Sections 9, 39, and 49B of the Act. Section 9 of the Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, while Section 39 prohibits possession, sale, or transport of any wild animal, bird, or plant, or any part or derivative thereof, without a valid permit. Section 49B provides for punishment for contravention of any provision of the Act or any rule or order made thereunder.

The prosecution had alleged that the petitioner had been found in possession of articles made up of skins of lizards and snakes, which are protected under the Act. The petitioner had denied the allegations and had claimed that the articles were not made up of such skins. The trial court had convicted the petitioner and had sentenced him to imprisonment and fine.

The petitioner had challenged the conviction and sentence before the higher court, arguing that the prosecution had failed to establish that the articles seized were made up of skins of such lizards or snakes as were enumerated in one or the other Schedules of the Act. The petitioner's counsel had also argued that the charge had been framed without proper application of mind and without considering the evidence on record.

The court, after considering the arguments of both sides, found that the complaint and evidence did not disclose any offence, and the charge ought not to have been framed. The court observed that the prosecution had failed to establish that the articles seized were made up of skins of such lizards or snakes as were enumerated in one or the other Schedules of the Act. The court also noted that the charge had been framed without proper application of mind and without considering the evidence on record.

In light of these observations, the court set aside the conviction and sentence, quashed the charge, and discharged the petitioner-accused. The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of proper application of mind and adherence to the principles of natural justice in criminal proceedings. The order also highlights the need for strict adherence to the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, in order to ensure effective protection of wildlife and their habitats.
