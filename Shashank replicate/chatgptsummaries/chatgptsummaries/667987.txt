In a recent court case, the question of whether a transferee of immovable property, which had been attached in execution of a decree for money, was competent to make an application for cancellation of the sale under Rule 89 of Order XXI of the Code of 1908 was raised. The District Judge had allowed the transferee's application, but the petitioner argued that the transferee had no locus standi to make such an application. The court ultimately held that the transferee had become the owner of the property and had acquired an interest therein within the meaning of Rule 89, and was therefore competent to apply under that section.

The case centered around the interpretation of Rule 89 of Order XXI of the Code of 1908, which deals with the cancellation of sales of immovable property. The rule states that "where immovable property has been sold in execution of a decree, any person either owning such property or holding an interest therein by virtue of a title acquired before such sale may apply to have the sale set aside." The question before the court was whether a transferee of the property, who had acquired it after the sale had taken place, could be considered to have "acquired an interest therein" within the meaning of the rule.

The petitioner argued that the transferee had no locus standi to make an application under Rule 89, as they had not owned the property at the time of the sale. The petitioner contended that the rule was intended to protect the interests of those who owned or held an interest in the property at the time of the sale, and that allowing a transferee to make an application would defeat this purpose.

The court, however, disagreed with the petitioner's interpretation of the rule. The court held that the language of Rule 89 was broad enough to encompass a transferee who had acquired an interest in the property after the sale had taken place. The court noted that the rule did not specify that the interest had to be acquired before the sale, only that it had to be acquired "by virtue of a title." The court held that the transferee had acquired such a title when they had purchased the property from the original owner, who had owned the property at the time of the sale.

The court also noted that allowing a transferee to make an application under Rule 89 would not defeat the purpose of the rule. The court held that the rule was intended to protect the interests of those who had an interest in the property at the time of the sale, regardless of whether they had owned the property at that time. The court noted that the purpose of the rule was to provide a remedy for those who had been wrongfully deprived of their property, and that allowing a transferee to make an application would further this purpose.

In light of these findings, the court held that the transferee was competent to make an application under Rule 89, and that the District Judge had correctly allowed their application. The court therefore discharged the Rule with costs.

Overall, this case provides an important clarification of the scope of Rule 89 of Order XXI of the Code of 1908. The court's interpretation of the rule makes it clear that a transferee of immovable property can be considered to have "acquired an interest therein" within the meaning of the rule, and is therefore competent to make an application for cancellation of a sale. This interpretation of the rule is likely to be welcomed by transferees who have been wrongfully deprived of their property, as it provides them with a clear avenue for seeking redress.
