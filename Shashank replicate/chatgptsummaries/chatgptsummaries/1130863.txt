The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by A. Moses against ICICI Bank, seeking a writ of mandamus to prevent the bank from seizing his hypothecated vehicle. The petitioner had taken a loan from the bank to purchase a lorry, which was hypothecated to the bank. Due to a government order prohibiting transportation of sand from Tamil Nadu to other states, the petitioner's business was affected, and he was unable to pay the dues from January 2009. The bank sent musclemen to the petitioner's residence to threaten him and his family, which prompted him to file the writ petition.

The court held that the writ petition was not maintainable against a private bank, and that the bank could not be heard to say that they were entitled to proceed against the petitioner without resorting to the procedure recognized by law. The court deprecated the practice of banks hiring recovery agents and musclemen to seize vehicles and stated that the bank must resort to the procedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicles in cases where the borrower may have committed default in payment of the installments.

The court order states that the practice of hiring recovery agents who use strong-arm tactics is not allowed by law and should be discouraged. The bank should follow legal procedures to take possession of vehicles in cases of default instead of using musclemen. The bank must take note of the Supreme Court's observations on recovery while proceeding against the hypothecated vehicle involved in the writ petition. Recovery through musclemen is not permitted by law.

The writ petition is disposed of subject to the above observations, and there shall be no order as to costs.
