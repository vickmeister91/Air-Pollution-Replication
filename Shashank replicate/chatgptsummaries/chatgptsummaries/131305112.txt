In a recent court order, the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail was rejected in connection with a case of illegal mining of stones in the forest. The court cited the alleged offense under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act and Sections 2/3 A of Forest Conservation Act as the reason for the rejection.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927, is an act that consolidates the law relating to forests, the transit of forest-produce and the duty leviable on timber and other forest-produce. Section 33 of the act deals with the punishment for offenses committed in a reserved forest or a protected forest. The section states that any person who contravenes any of the provisions of the act or any rule made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with a fine which may extend to five hundred rupees or with both.

The Forest Conservation Act, 1980, is an act that provides for the conservation of forests and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. Sections 2 and 3 A of the act deal with the restrictions on the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. Section 2 states that no state government or other authority shall make any order directing that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non-forest purpose unless it is satisfied that the use of such forest land for that purpose is unavoidable and that there are no other reasonable alternatives. Section 3 A, on the other hand, deals with the restrictions on the diversion of forest land for mining operations. The section states that no forest land shall be diverted for the purpose of mining except with the prior approval of the central government.

In the present case, the petitioner had sought anticipatory bail in connection with a case of illegal mining of stones in the forest. The court, however, rejected the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail citing the alleged offense under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act and Sections 2/3 A of Forest Conservation Act. The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had allegedly contravened the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act by carrying out illegal mining in the forest without the prior approval of the central government.

The court's decision to reject the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail is significant as it sends a strong message to those who engage in illegal mining activities in the forest. The court's decision also highlights the importance of protecting the forest and its resources, which are essential for the survival of various species of flora and fauna.

In conclusion, the court's decision to reject the petitioner's request for anticipatory bail in connection with a case of illegal mining of stones in the forest is a significant step towards protecting the forest and its resources. The court's decision is based on the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest Conservation Act, which are aimed at conserving the forest and its resources. The decision sends a strong message to those who engage in illegal mining activities in the forest and highlights the importance of protecting the forest and its resources for the survival of various species of flora and fauna.
