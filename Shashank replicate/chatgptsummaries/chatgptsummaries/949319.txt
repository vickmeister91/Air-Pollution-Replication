The court order in question relates to a case where the petitioner was accused of receiving a bribe and was charged under Sections 7 and 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The petitioner had filed a petition requesting the summoning of certain documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. However, the trial court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the documents were not relevant. The petitioner challenged this order in the High Court, but the court upheld the trial court's decision, stating that the documents were not necessary or desirable to summon.

The Prevention of Corruption Act is a law in India that criminalizes the act of taking or giving bribes. Section 7 of the Act deals with the offense of taking a bribe, while Section 13(1)(d) deals with the offense of criminal misconduct by a public servant. In this case, the petitioner was accused of receiving a bribe and was charged under both these sections.

The petitioner had filed a petition in the trial court requesting the summoning of certain documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons to any person for the production of any document or other thing that the court considers necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C.

However, the trial court dismissed the petitioner's petition on the grounds that the documents were not relevant. The petitioner then challenged this order in the High Court.

The High Court, after considering the arguments of both parties, upheld the trial court's decision. The court stated that the documents requested by the petitioner were not necessary or desirable to summon. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish how the documents were relevant to the case.

The court's decision was based on the principle that the power to summon documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The court noted that the power to summon documents should not be used as a fishing expedition or to harass the other party.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means, such as by issuing a notice to the person in possession of the documents or by filing an application under the Right to Information Act.

In conclusion, the court order in this case pertains to a petition filed by the petitioner requesting the summoning of certain documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The trial court had dismissed the petition on the grounds that the documents were not relevant, and the High Court upheld this decision. The court's decision was based on the principle that the power to summon documents under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is discretionary and must be exercised judiciously. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to establish how the documents were relevant to the case and had not made any effort to obtain the documents through other means.
