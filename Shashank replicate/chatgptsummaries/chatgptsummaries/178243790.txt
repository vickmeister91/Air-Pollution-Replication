The court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Kaptan Singh against the State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) regarding an order issued by the SDM Model Town to remove a submersible pump from Singh's property. Singh challenged the order on the grounds of non-observance of environmental protection rules and lack of natural justice. The court found that the SDM's order suffered from a lack of due process and was passed mechanically. The court also noted that the SDM had issued a notice to Singh to remove the pump, which Singh claimed was issued without proper notice and was manipulated. The court ordered an investigation into the matter.

The court order also pertains to a complaint received by the SDM Model Town that the petitioner was using a submersible pump/bore-well without a license or requisite permission. The petitioner challenges the existence of a previous order and claims that it was fabricated by the SDM Model Town. The court finds that the impugned order passed by the SDM Model Town does not stand judicial scrutiny and warrants interference by the court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction. The court also notes that the proceedings initiated under the Environment (Protection) Act are judicial in nature and the competent authority/SDM is under an obligation to follow the procedure established by law.

The court order states that the competent authority must follow the established procedure by law, which includes informing the alleged violator of the allegations against them and providing them with an opportunity to be heard before passing a final order. In this case, the SDM did not follow this procedure and did not provide notice to either the complainant or the revisionist. The court found that the SDM acted in disregard of established rules and procedures and set aside the impugned order and notice. The court also criticized the SDM's conduct and noted that he acted mechanically and in complete violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court order sets aside the actions taken by Dr. Navlendra Kumar Singh, the then SDM Model Town, Delhi, in 2013. The court also deems it necessary to bring his conduct to the notice of the Chief Secretary, Government of NCT, Delhi, for appropriate action. A copy of the order will be sent to the Chief Secretary for information and compliance. The present Revision Petition is disposed of accordingly, and the file of the revision petition will be consigned to the Record Room.
