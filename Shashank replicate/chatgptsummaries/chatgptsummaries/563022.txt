The Ranthambore National Park is a wildlife sanctuary located in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, India. It is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and various species of birds. The park is spread over an area of 392 square kilometers and is a popular tourist destination. However, the increasing number of visitors and the lack of proper management have led to concerns about the impact on the environment and wildlife.

To address these concerns, the court has issued a series of directions in a court order aimed at protecting and preserving the park. The order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife and urges the government to take appropriate measures. The court has directed the development of a parking complex, regulating the entry of vehicles into the park, and maintaining an eco-sensitive zone. The order also addresses the shortage of staff and equipment and the need for proper financial management.

One of the key directions in the court order is the establishment of a separate account for the Ranthambore National Park. The State Government has been directed to deposit all funds received for the park in that account. This will ensure that the funds are used for the development and maintenance of the park and not diverted for other purposes.

The court order also calls for the establishment of a separate prosecution wing under the Wildlife Act to check poaching. The order also sets guidelines for eco-friendly tourism, including keeping a distance from wild animals and prohibiting the use of flash photography. The court has also called for the development of a Tiger Safari park to ease pressure on the National Park.

The court order also addresses the issue of villages located within the park area. The court has directed the shifting of villages from the park area to reduce human-wildlife conflict. The order also prohibits the use of weapons within the park area and places the responsibility of park officers to ensure compliance.

The court order highlights the importance of protecting the environment and wildlife and calls for the implementation of appropriate measures to achieve this goal. The court has emphasized the need for proper management of the park and the importance of eco-friendly tourism. The court order is a significant step towards the protection and preservation of the Ranthambore National Park and its wildlife.
