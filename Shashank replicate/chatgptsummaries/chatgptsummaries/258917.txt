The Bombay High Court heard a public interest petition that claimed various reliefs, some of which were outside the court's jurisdiction. The petitioner agreed to confine the petition to the reliefs claimed for areas within the state. The court directed the Chief Secretary and the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Corporation to file their respective affidavits. The matter had been pending for a long time, and the court reserved its judgment on April 9, 2008, and pronounced it on July 22, 2008.

The court order includes several reliefs, such as banning the immersion of idols in natural streams, providing inspection and punishment for those who throw waste in natural streams, constructing toilets, banning the immersion of dead bodies in water streams, and setting up a water treatment plant. The petitioner argued that all religions preach love and non-violence, and that the ban on cow slaughter is state policy. The court may recommend enacting legislation for setting up environment protection commissions at national, state, and district levels.

The court order addresses the issue of pollution caused by the immersion of Ganesh idols during the Ganpati festival. The petitioner claimed that this is against Hinduism and quoted religious texts to support their argument. The court acknowledged the need to control pollution and directed the government to construct toilets along the beach between Santacruz and Khar Danda. The court also expected the government to form a committee to create awareness about the need to protect water bodies and the environment. The issue of banning the immersion of bones or ashes in water streams and community bathing during religious occasions was left to the government to address through the guidelines they are developing.

The court has ordered the Central and State Governments to consider laying down guidelines for the immersion of idols in water bodies to prevent pollution. The court warned that delaying action on this matter could be dangerous for the environment in the long run. The writ petition has been disposed of with these directions.
