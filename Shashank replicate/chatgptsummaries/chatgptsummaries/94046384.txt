The court order pertains to multiple cases related to mining activities of English India Clays Limited in Kerala. The cases include challenges to orders passed by the District Collector under the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, seeking police protection for mining and transportation of china clay, withdrawal of interdiction made to mining activities, and seeking interdiction of mining activities for lack of prior Environmental Clearance. The court heard all the cases together and delivered a judgment on October 4, 2018. The order discusses the arguments made by the parties and the legal provisions applicable to the cases.

One of the cases discussed in the court order involves mining activities without obtaining prior environmental clearance and violating lease conditions. The respondent argues that they have obtained necessary approvals and that the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) has recommended the issuance of an Environmental Clearance (EC). The petitioners argue that the mining activities have caused damage to the environment and that an impact assessment cannot be carried out now that the mining has already commenced. The court finds that one of the appellants had suppressed information and agrees with the Division Bench order. The case is ongoing.

Another case discussed in the court order involves a mining company that began operations without obtaining an environmental clearance (EC) as required by law. The court notes that the company had suppressed information about pending litigation and engaged multiple lawyers who were not aware of the facts in other cases. The court also examines lease agreements and government orders related to the mining activity. The company claims to have applied for an EC, but the court finds that this was done only after several years of mining activity had already taken place. The court ultimately rules against the company and orders it to stop mining until it obtains the necessary clearances.

The court also discusses a case involving a mining company's illegal operations without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The company only owned 26.6 acres of land in a leased area of 35 acres and had purchased the remaining land from other individuals. The mining operations were confined to areas belonging to the company, but the company had not obtained an environmental clearance before commencing operations. The court also notes that the SEAC had recommended against issuing an environmental clearance due to violations of regulations. The court finds the company's activities to be illegal and in violation of environmental regulations.

In another case, the court discusses the violation of environmental regulations by a mining company in Veilur Village. The SEAC and State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEIAA) noticed the violation and directed proceedings to be initiated under the Environment Protection Act. The company commenced mining without prior EC, which was a mandatory requirement. The court also notes that the company did not have ownership of a portion of the land they were mining on and did not obtain consent from all property owners. The government officers were found to have a lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing environmental regulations and preserving the environment. The court also references a study conducted by the State's own Directorate of Mining and Geology, which reported environmental depredation caused by the mining operations. Despite the detailed study and report, the company was allowed to continue its operations without any action taken by the government.

The court order references a proposal made by the Director of Mining and Geology in 2006, which led to the issuance of an order in 2008 and a lease deed in 2008. The court notes that the Director did not bring to the government's attention the need for a prior environmental clearance for areas above 5 hectares. The court also criticizes the government for remaining silent on the violations committed by the mining company. The court cites previous litigation on the requirement for environmental clearance and notes that the government had granted indiscriminate renewals of permits. The court also discusses amendments made to the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules in 2015 and challenges to those amendments.

The court order states that there is no law that permits mining without environmental clearance, and that the State cannot be exempt from following the regulations laid down by the Apex Court in Deepak Kumar's case. The court also notes that the indiscriminate quarrying and mining has led to environmental damage and contributed to the recent floods and landslides in the State. The court emphasizes the need for sustained development and effective implementation of laws to protect the environment.

In a case of illegal mining that caused environmental damage, the court orders the government and lawmakers to consider sustainable alternative methods and prevent future calamities. The company involved in the illegal mining did not have a prior EC and violated the Environment Protection Act and EIA notifications. The court orders an inspection of the site and recovery of the value of materials excavated from the land. The district collector is directed to take possession of the lands to facilitate an independent inquiry.

The court has ordered the police to take possession of lands where illegal mining has been carried out to facilitate an independent inquiry. No activity is allowed until the inspection is conducted, and the value of the illegal mining and extraction is assessed. The court found that the company's actions in approaching the court for police protection without a prior EC and then seeking issuance of EC relying on a deeming provision without impleading those who had challenged the mining activity for no prior EC was an abuse of process. The court imposed exemplary costs on the company and directed the state to initiate prosecution against the officials of the company and the erring officers of the state under the Environment Protection Act.
