Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a different case. The first order relates to a revision petition filed by Ashis Pandit against an order passed by the Ld. MM declaring him as an absconder/PO in connection with a case registered under sections 420/406/409 r/w 120 B IPC in Economic Offences Wing, Mandir Marg, New Delhi. The revisionist argued that he had cooperated with the investigation and that no role was assigned to him in the SFIO report. The court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the trial court record to be sent back with an attested copy of the order.

The second court order pertains to a case where the petitioner had applied for anticipatory bail, but the IO had also applied for the petitioner to be declared a proclaimed offender. The petitioner argued that there was no case against him and that he had been falsely implicated. The court noted that the petitioner's anticipatory bail had been dismissed by the High Court and that he had been declared a proclaimed offender by the lower court. The court also noted that the petitioner had been avoiding the court process and had been concealing himself. The court ultimately dismissed the petitioner's revision petition.

The third court order states that the accused, Ashish Pandit, was declared an absconder in a criminal case. The defense counsel argued that the application was listed for a later time and the accused was not present at the time of the declaration. However, the court dismissed the application as infructuous and ordered it to be put up on a later date. The court also dismissed the revision petition filed by the accused, stating that there was no merit in it. The trial court record was ordered to be sent back with an attested copy of the order.

In the first case, Ashis Pandit had filed a revision petition against an order passed by the Ld. MM declaring him as an absconder/PO in connection with a case registered under sections 420/406/409 r/w 120 B IPC in Economic Offences Wing, Mandir Marg, New Delhi. The revisionist argued that he had cooperated with the investigation and that no role was assigned to him in the SFIO report. However, the court dismissed the revision petition and ordered the trial court record to be sent back with an attested copy of the order. This implies that the order passed by the Ld. MM declaring Ashis Pandit as an absconder/PO will stand.

In the second case, the petitioner had applied for anticipatory bail, but the IO had also applied for the petitioner to be declared a proclaimed offender. The petitioner argued that there was no case against him and that he had been falsely implicated. However, the court noted that the petitioner's anticipatory bail had been dismissed by the High Court and that he had been declared a proclaimed offender by the lower court. The court also noted that the petitioner had been avoiding the court process and had been concealing himself. As a result, the court dismissed the petitioner's revision petition.

In the third case, the accused, Ashish Pandit, was declared an absconder in a criminal case. The defense counsel argued that the application was listed for a later time and the accused was not present at the time of the declaration. However, the court dismissed the application as infructuous and ordered it to be put up on a later date. The court also dismissed the revision petition filed by the accused, stating that there was no merit in it. The trial court record was ordered to be sent back with an attested copy of the order.

In all three cases, the court has dismissed the revision petitions filed by the petitioners/accused. This implies that the orders passed by the lower courts will stand. The court has also ordered the trial court record to be sent back with an attested copy of the order in two of the cases. The reasons for the dismissal of the revision petitions vary from case to case. In the first case, the court found no merit in the revision petition filed by Ashis Pandit. In the second case, the court noted that the petitioner had been avoiding the court process and had been concealing himself. In the third case, the court dismissed the application as infructuous and ordered it to be put up on a later date.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of cooperating with the investigation and attending court proceedings. Failure to do so can result in unfavorable orders being passed by the court. It is also important to note that revision petitions can be dismissed if there is no merit in them or if the petitioner has been avoiding the court process.
