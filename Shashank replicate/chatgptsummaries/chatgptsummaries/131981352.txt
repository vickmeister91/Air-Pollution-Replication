Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that has been used in various manufacturing processes for decades. However, it is also known to cause serious health problems, including lung cancer and mesothelioma. In India, the use of asbestos is increasing every year, while developed countries have drastically reduced its manufacture and some have even banned different types of asbestos. This has led to concerns about the health and safety of workers involved in the mining and manufacturing of asbestos.

In response to these concerns, several writ petitions have been filed in Indian courts seeking a ban on the use of asbestos and the constitution of a committee to identify and certify workers/victims suffering from asbestos-related diseases or cancer. One such petition was filed by Kalyaneshwari under Article 32 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner claimed that there is complete failure on the part of the manufacturers in providing safety equipment to workers, regular health check-ups, monitoring air-borne dust, and maintaining health registers of the workmen.

The respondents, including various states and the Union of India, filed separate affidavits stating that appropriate measures are being taken to ensure the working of such units in accordance with the law. The Court examined whether any statutory, fundamental, or other right of any person is being violated and whether the government is actively permitting such illegal activity. The Court found that there is no law enacted so far which requires banning of any activity in regard to asbestos at the stage of mining, manufacture, or production. The Court also found that the Writ Petition filed does not provide any data or detailed facts in relation to such uncontrolled or unauthorized activity of manufacture of asbestos being carried out in any state.

The court order discusses the writ petition seeking a ban on the use of asbestos due to its hazardous effects on human health. The court notes that there is no law banning the use of asbestos in various manufacturing processes despite its adverse effects on human health. The court issues directions to ensure that the directions contained in the judgment of this Court in the case of Consumer Education and Research Centre are strictly adhered to. The court also directs the Union of India and the States to review safeguards in relation to primary as well as secondary exposure to asbestos. The court further directs that if Union of India considers it proper and in public interest, it should constitute a regulatory body to exercise proper control and supervision over manufacturing of asbestos activities while ensuring due regard to the aspect of health care of the workmen involved in such activity.

Another petition was filed by an NGO regarding the ban on asbestos mining and manufacturing. However, the court questioned the motives of the NGO, citing its previous conduct in a similar case and lack of evidence to support its claims. The court also noted that the petition lacked bona fides and was an abuse of the court's process, filed for private interests rather than public good. The court emphasized the importance of public interest litigation being genuine and not motivated by extraneous considerations.

In yet another case, a petition to ban mining and manufacturing activities related to asbestos or its allied products was denied by the court. The court accused the petitioner of lacking bona fide and filing the petition for private interests. The court issued a notice to the petitioner to show cause why proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 should not be initiated against them and/or why exemplary cost should not be imposed upon them. The court also dismissed an application for impleadment.

In conclusion, while there have been several writ petitions seeking a ban on the use of asbestos and the constitution of a committee to identify and certify workers/victims suffering from asbestos-related diseases or cancer, the courts have been cautious in their approach. While acknowledging the hazardous effects of asbestos on human health, the courts have also emphasized the importance of genuine public interest litigation and the need for evidence to support claims. The courts have also directed the Union of India and the States to review safeguards in relation to primary as well as secondary exposure to asbestos and to consider constituting a regulatory body to exercise proper control and supervision over manufacturing of asbestos activities while ensuring due regard to the aspect of health care of the workmen involved in such activity.
