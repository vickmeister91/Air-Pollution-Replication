The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by M/S Bhavani Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other respondents. The petitioner sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit. 

The court found that the petitioner was a licensee with a valid license to operate the unit and that the closure notice was similar to those issued to other crushing unit owners. The court followed the decision of a Division Bench in a similar case and quashed the closure notice. The court allowed the petitioner to operate the unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order.

The court order is significant as it upholds the rights of licensees to operate their units without arbitrary interference from regulatory authorities. The court found that the closure notice was not based on any specific violation of environmental norms and was issued merely on the basis of a general inspection report. The court also noted that the petitioner had taken steps to address any environmental concerns and had submitted an application for renewal of its license.

The court's decision is in line with the principles of natural justice and due process, which require that regulatory authorities act fairly and reasonably in enforcing environmental norms. The court's decision also highlights the need for regulatory authorities to adopt a more proactive and consultative approach in dealing with environmental issues, rather than resorting to punitive measures.

Overall, the court order is a positive development for the mining and quarrying industry in Karnataka, as it provides greater clarity and certainty for licensees in operating their units. The court's decision also underscores the importance of balancing environmental concerns with the need for economic development and job creation.
