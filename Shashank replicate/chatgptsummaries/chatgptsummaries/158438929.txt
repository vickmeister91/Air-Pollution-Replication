The Mount Abu Eco Sensitive Zone is a protected area in the state of Rajasthan, India. The court order aims to protect the environment in this zone by implementing various measures. The court has directed the respondents to vest the powers of the Monitoring Committee in the Divisional Commissioner. This means that the Divisional Commissioner will now have the authority to oversee the implementation of the court's orders and ensure that the environment is protected.

The court has also directed the respondents to hold monthly meetings to review progress and consider objections. This will ensure that the implementation of the court's orders is monitored regularly and any issues or objections are addressed in a timely manner. Additionally, the court has directed the constitution of a sub-committee of experts to identify new constructions and removal of trees. This sub-committee will be responsible for identifying any new constructions that may harm the environment and recommending their removal. It will also identify trees that need to be removed to protect the environment.

The court has also allowed for the construction of toilets in schools and villages, subject to evaluation by the Monitoring Committee. This is a significant step towards improving sanitation in the area while ensuring that the environment is not harmed. The Monitoring Committee will evaluate the proposed construction of toilets and ensure that they are built in a manner that does not harm the environment.

The matter has been listed for the next compliance report to be filed on 5th February 2015. This means that the respondents will have to file a report on the implementation of the court's orders by this date. The court will review this report and take further action if necessary.
