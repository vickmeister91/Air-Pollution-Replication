The court order summaries revolve around the protection of wildlife and the environment, particularly in the context of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The first court order discusses a public interest litigation filed by Bharat Jhunjhunwala, which sought to protect the Turtle Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) at Kashi (Varanasi) and prevent its shifting upstream. The court noted that a technical report submitted by the Wildlife Institution of India (WII) in July 2018 found that the TWS had very low encounter rates of turtles, indicating high human disturbance and habitat alterations. The report recommended that a stretch from downstream Newada in Allahabad District to Adalpur in Mirzapur District be considered as a conservation priority area and brought under the purview of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The State Board for Wild Life recommended the denotification of the TWS along with compensatory/mitigation measures, and the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife recommended the proposal of the State Government to notify the stretch of 30 kms at Newada near Allahabad (940-970 kms) as wildlife sanctuary under the provisions of the Act, 1972 for conservation of turtles and other aquatic fauna. The court found that the proposed shifting of the sanctuary was based on a scientific study made by WII and suffered from no illegality.

The second court order discusses the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, which was enacted to protect wildlife and birds. The Act created several authorities to enforce its provisions and was amended in 1991 to include specified plants under its protection. The Act defines terms such as "National Park" and "Sanctuary" and provides for the appointment of officers and a Wildlife Advisory Board. Chapter IV deals with protected areas, including Sanctuaries and National Parks. The State Government can declare an area as a Sanctuary if it is of ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural, or zoological significance. The Collector is required to determine the existence, nature, and extent of rights of any person in or over the land within the Sanctuary. The amended Section 18 requires the State Government to declare its intention to constitute an area as a Sanctuary. The newly inserted Section 26A provides for the declaration of an area as a Sanctuary and prohibits the alteration of its boundaries without a resolution passed by the Legislature of the State.

The third court order discusses the process for declaring an area as a sanctuary for the purpose of protecting wildlife and its environment. The State Government can declare an area as a sanctuary if it is of ecological, faunal, floral, geomorphological, natural or zoological significance. The declaration of an area as a sanctuary is made under Section 26A(1) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The boundaries of a sanctuary cannot be altered by the State Government except on a recommendation of the National Board. The court order also discusses a proposal to denotify an existing Tortoise Wildlife Sanctuary in Varanasi and notify a new wildlife sanctuary in a different area based on a scientific study conducted by an expert team. The proposal was recommended by the State Board for Wildlife and the National Board for Wildlife.

The fourth court order discusses the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002, which provide for the constitution and functions of the National Board for Wild Life and the State Board for Wild Life. The court affirms the primacy of the opinion expressed by the National Board for Wildlife over the State Board for Wildlife in matters relating to wildlife conservation. The scope of judicial review in policy matters and administrative decisions is limited, and the court will not interfere unless there are substantial and compelling reasons to do so. The court cites previous cases to support this position.

The fifth court order discusses the scope of judicial review in matters of government decision-making, particularly in cases involving safety and environmental concerns. The court emphasizes that while it is not the role of the courts to make policy decisions or interfere with matters of economic policy, they can oversee that those with expertise have been consulted and their recommendations have been followed. The court also notes that interference with the discretion of the government is warranted only when decisions are found to be arbitrary, mala fide, based on extraneous considerations, or against statutory provisions. Overall, the court emphasizes the need for a balance between the three branches of government and the importance of promoting good administration in the public interest.

The sixth court order discusses the purpose of judicial review of administrative action, which is to ensure good administration and promote the public good. The scope of judicial review has expanded to include diverse forms of "public" power. However, courts may not interfere with the exercise of discretion unless some specific fault can be established. The court also discusses the role of policy-based decision-making and the limited scope of judicial review in such cases. The court ultimately dismisses a public interest litigation challenging the denotification of a wildlife sanctuary, as the decision was based on the opinion of experts and followed due procedure under the law. The petitioner is allowed to submit suggestions on the proposal.

In summary, the court orders highlight the importance of protecting wildlife and the environment through the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The courts emphasize the need for a balance between the three branches of government and the importance of promoting good administration in the public interest. The courts also affirm the primacy of the opinion expressed by the National Board for Wildlife
