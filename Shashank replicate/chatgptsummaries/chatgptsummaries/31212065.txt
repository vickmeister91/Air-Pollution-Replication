The Karnataka High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by M/S Ambient Controls Pvt Ltd against an order passed by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board on May 28, 2016. The court held that the petitioner had an alternative and efficacious remedy by way of an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court rejected the writ petition but allowed the petitioner to approach the appropriate forum in accordance with the law. The court made no order as to costs.

The case involved a dispute between M/S Ambient Controls Pvt Ltd and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board over the latter's order to shut down the petitioner's industrial unit for violating pollution control norms. The petitioner had challenged the order on the grounds that it was arbitrary, illegal, and violative of the principles of natural justice. The petitioner had also sought a direction from the court to quash the order and allow the petitioner to continue its operations.

The court, however, held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, which provides for an appeal to the appellate authority against an order passed by the pollution control board. The court noted that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy and had instead approached the court directly through a writ petition. The court held that this was not permissible and that the petitioner must first exhaust the statutory remedy before approaching the court.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference by the court in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. The court noted that the pollution control board had passed the order after due consideration of the material on record and after giving the petitioner an opportunity to be heard. The court held that the order was not arbitrary or illegal and did not suffer from any procedural irregularity. The court, therefore, held that there was no ground for interference by the court in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction.

The court, however, did not dismiss the petitioner's case outright. Instead, the court allowed the petitioner to approach the appropriate forum in accordance with the law. The court held that the petitioner could file an appeal under Section 31 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and that the appellate authority would consider the matter on its merits. The court also clarified that the petitioner was free to raise all the grounds and contentions that it had raised in the writ petition before the appellate authority.

In conclusion, the Karnataka High Court's decision in M/S Ambient Controls Pvt Ltd v. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board is a reminder of the importance of exhausting statutory remedies before approaching the court through a writ petition. The court's decision also underscores the need for strict compliance with pollution control norms and the consequences of non-compliance. The court's decision is likely to have a significant impact on the industrial sector in Karnataka and may lead to greater compliance with pollution control norms.
