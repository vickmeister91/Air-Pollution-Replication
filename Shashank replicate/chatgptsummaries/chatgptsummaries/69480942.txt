The Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972 is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats in India. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading in wildlife and their products. The act also provides for the establishment of protected areas, such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, where hunting and other activities that harm wildlife are strictly prohibited.

The act provides for strict penalties for such offenses, including imprisonment and fines. Binish M. has filed a bail application, seeking release from custody while the case is pending.

The court has directed Binish M. to surrender before the Investigating Officer within 10 days. This means that Binish M. must present himself to the officer in charge of the investigation and cooperate with the investigation. Failure to do so may result in further legal action against him.

The court has also directed Binish M. to appear before the jurisdictional court on the same day for consideration of the bail application. The jurisdictional court is the court that has jurisdiction over the area where the offense was committed. Binish M. must appear before this court to argue his case for bail.
