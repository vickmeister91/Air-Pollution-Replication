In January 2013, John Mensah filed a petition against the State of Punjab in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh. However, during the proceedings, Mensah's counsel requested to withdraw the petition in order to file an application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the lower court. The court granted the request and dismissed the petition with liberty aforesaid.

It is unclear from the court order what the original petition was about or what the application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would entail. However, Section 91 allows for the court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other material that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

It is possible that Mensah's original petition was related to a criminal case and that he needed to obtain certain documents or materials through the application under Section 91. By withdrawing the petition and filing the application before the lower court, Mensah may have been able to expedite the process and obtain the necessary materials more quickly.

Overall, the court order simply reflects the decision to allow Mensah to withdraw his petition and pursue an application under Section 91 before the lower court. It does not provide any further details about the case or the reasons behind Mensah's actions.
