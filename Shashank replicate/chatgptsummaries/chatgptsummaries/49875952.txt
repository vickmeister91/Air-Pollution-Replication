The Delhi District Court recently disposed of a suit filed by Vikas Kalkal against various government bodies and officials. The suit was filed due to the illegal laying of a sewer pipeline on Gram Sabha land, which was causing environmental hazards and water logging. The court ordered all defendants to remove the illegal sewerage pipeline and take appropriate action to stop the effluence of illegal sewerage. The court also ordered the defendants to remove the water logging into the Gram Sabha land and pay damages as adjudicated by the court. Some defendants were deleted from the array of parties, and written statements were filed on behalf of the remaining defendants.

However, the court order states that the suit filed by the plaintiff is not maintainable due to Section 41(h) of the Specific Relief Act, after fulfilling mandatory requirements prescribed under the Water Act, 1974; Air Act, 1981, and The Environment Act, 1986. The court also discusses the evidence presented by both parties and makes findings on various issues, including whether the suit is bad for misjoinder and non-joinder of necessary parties. The court concludes that the suit cannot be dismissed only due to procedural lapses and that the defendants cannot shrug off their responsibility.

The court order discusses several issues related to the lawsuit. The court notes that the plaintiff has not named the land grabbers, but this does not discharge the burden of the defendants. The court also discusses the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Act and the bar of jurisdiction. The court decides that the suit is not bad for misjoinder of the parties and that defendant no. 7 and 11 are necessary parties. The court also discusses whether an equally efficacious remedy is available under section 41(h) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The court decides in favor of the plaintiff and against defendant no. 11. The court also discusses whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief of permanent and mandatory injunction and whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of damages. The court ultimately decides against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendants due to the plaintiff's lack of proof of ownership and unauthorized occupation of public land.

In another court order, the court states that the plaintiff has failed to prove ownership of the plot and the extent of construction on it, as well as the cause and cost of the alleged wall collapse. Therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the damages they requested, and the suit is dismissed. However, the court is concerned about the plaintiff's right to a healthy environment and instructs the defendants to assess the situation and take appropriate steps to prevent health hazards caused by sewerage waste.

In summary, the Delhi District Court has disposed of a suit filed by Vikas Kalkal against various government bodies and officials due to the illegal laying of a sewer pipeline on Gram Sabha land, which was causing environmental hazards and water logging. The court ordered all defendants to remove the illegal sewerage pipeline and take appropriate action to stop the effluence of illegal sewerage.
