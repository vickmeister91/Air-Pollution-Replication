The Delhi High Court recently issued two court orders pertaining to land use and construction regulations in the city. The first order was in response to a writ petition filed by a respondent who owns the second floor of a building in Delhi. The appellant, who is the allottee of the plot, had entered into a collaboration agreement with the respondent to develop the property. However, a dispute arose over excess construction and the use of the basement for a coaching center and the ground floor for a bank without obtaining prior permission from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

The court granted the appellant six months to obtain the necessary permission, failing which appropriate action would be taken. The order also outlines the regulations for mixed land use in residential plots under MPD-2021. The Master Plan Delhi 2021 (MPD-2021) is a comprehensive plan for the development of Delhi, which includes provisions for mixed land use in residential plots. The order clarifies that mixed land use is permitted in residential plots, subject to certain conditions, such as obtaining prior permission from the authorities and complying with building regulations.

The second court order pertains to the use of buildings in pedestrian shopping streets. It outlines additional conditions for public and semi-public activities, such as limitations on the number of banks and coaching centers allowed. The order also addresses questions of law related to the use of residential buildings for commercial purposes and the need for completion certificates.

The court concludes that the appellant must take steps to regularize any unauthorized construction and choose only one non-residential activity for their building. The order also outlines a process for obtaining permission for mixed land use and imposes a deadline for resolving any outstanding issues. The court emphasizes the need for compliance with building regulations and obtaining necessary permissions from the authorities.
