The British India Corporation Ltd. filed a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution to prevent the Punjab Industrial Tribunal from proceeding with a reference of industrial disputes made to it by the Punjab Government.

The Supreme Court remanded the case for decision and indicated the lines upon which the matter should be considered. The court found that two of the items in the reference had already been decided previously and should not have been included in the reference. The court granted a writ in the nature of prohibition directing the industrial tribunal not to consider those items in the reference under dispute.
