The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed by Kollidam Aaru Pathukappu Nala Sangam and others against the Union of India, State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, and Public Works Department regarding quarrying at various sand quarries in rivers Kollidam and Cauvery in Trichy and Karur districts. The petitioners seek a writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to quash the orders passed by the respondents and direct them to abstain from quarrying at the mentioned locations. The court has not provided a final decision or ruling in this order.

Another court order discusses the power of judicial review under Articles 226 and 227 of the Indian Constitution. The court examines various cases, including the creation of Administrative Tribunals and the Consumer Protection Act, and concludes that the power of judicial review is an essential feature of the Constitution and cannot be excluded or abridged. The court also notes that the power of judicial review is necessary to protect fundamental rights and balance the principles of majority rule and the protection of those rights.

The court order states that the power of judicial review is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution and cannot be taken away by any law enacted by Parliament. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 does not expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the High Courts under Articles 226/227, and any implied exclusion would not survive. The court also clarifies that a statutory remedy of appeal to the Supreme Court does not stand on a different footing than cases where no such statutory remedy of appeal is provided. The right of appeal under Section 22 of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 is subject to a serious restriction, while an appeal under Section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 is as a matter of right.

The court order discusses the maintainability of writ petitions under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 and the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The court rejects the objections made by the respondents to the maintainability of the writ petitions. The court then discusses the merits of the case, which involves sand quarrying operations in Tamil Nadu. The court notes that the State Government, the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), and the Lorry Owners' Association have accepted the verdict of the Southern Regional Bench of the National Green Tribunal. The court also notes that the Public Works Department of the State cannot continue quarrying operations beyond 24.8.2014 without obtaining environmental clearance in accordance with the new guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) on 24.12.2013. The court rejects the contention of the Advocate General that the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA on 30.11.2012 would survive for a full period of five years despite the adhoc guidelines themselves facing a natural death.

The court order grants the state government a six-month lease to make applications for environmental clearances in accordance with a MoEF notification. The court also notes that the SEIAA overreached its mandate and issued adhoc guidelines that were contrary to the Notification on EIA and the Supreme Court's directions in Deepak Kumar's case. The court dismisses the writ petitions and upholds the National Green Tribunal's order, which will bear fruit for the state government only until August 23, 2014.

Another court order discusses several contentions raised by the petitioners regarding the environmental clearances granted by the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) for mining projects. The court finds that the adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA for granting clearances to projects with a proposed mining area of less than 25 hectares are completely contrary to the Notification on EIA. The court also finds that the SEIAA is not competent to issue adhoc guidelines or grant environmental clearances for areas equivalent to or more than 5 hectares. The court further notes that the National Green Tribunal erred in comparing the adhoc guidelines issued by the SEIAA with those issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and that the environmental clearances granted by the SEIAA were based on an expired consent order. The court also discusses the requirement of a mining plan for minor minerals and finds that the mining plan submitted by the Public Works Department did not comply with the prescribed format and was not approved by a qualified person recognized by the State Government or authorized by the State Government.

The final court order discusses the issue of environmental clearances granted for sand mining in Tamil Nadu. The court finds that the clearances were granted contrary to the law and that there has been indiscriminate mechanical mining carried out by the state. However, the court decides not to set aside the clearances due to the time that has passed since they were granted. The court also dismisses petitions for impleading by the Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry Owners Federation and one M. Anand.

In summary, these court orders pertain to various writ petitions challenging the orders passed by the Southern Regional Bench of the National Green Tribunal and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority regarding sand quarrying operations in Tamil Nadu. The court discusses the power of judicial review under the Indian Constitution, the maintainability of writ petitions under the National Green Tribunal Act and the Contempt of Courts Act, and the environmental clearances granted for mining projects. The court also notes the importance of balancing majority rule and the protection of fundamental rights. Ultimately,
