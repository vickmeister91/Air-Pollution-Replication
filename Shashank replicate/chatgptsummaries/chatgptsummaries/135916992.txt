The case in question involves a petition filed under Section 482Cr.P.C. by the petitioner to set aside an order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Badi, Dholpur. The order in question refused to release a truck bearing Registration No. RJ 11GA 9643 to the petitioner. The truck is the case property of case FIR No.282/2018, registered at Police Station Basedi, Dholpur, for the offences under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 51 and 52 of Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and Sections 41 and 42 of Rajasthan Forest Act.

The petitioner relied on the Supreme Court's judgment in the case of Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai to allow the present petition and direct the trial court to release the truck seized as case property by imposing certain conditions.

The case of Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai is relevant to the present case as it dealt with the release of seized vehicles in cases where the vehicle is not the subject matter of the offence. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the release of the vehicle could be ordered subject to certain conditions, such as the deposit of a certain amount of money or the furnishing of a bank guarantee.

In the present case, the petitioner argued that the truck in question was not the subject matter of the offence and therefore should be released. The trial court had refused to release the truck on the grounds that it was the case property and could not be released until the trial was concluded.

The Supreme Court, however, agreed with the petitioner and held that the truck could be released subject to certain conditions. The Court noted that the truck was not the subject matter of the offence and that its release would not prejudice the trial in any way. The Court also noted that the truck was a valuable asset and that its continued detention would cause hardship to the petitioner.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court directed the trial court to release the truck to the petitioner subject to the following conditions:

1. The petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- with the trial court as a condition for the release of the truck.

2. The petitioner shall furnish a bank guarantee for the balance amount of the value of the truck.

3. The petitioner shall undertake to produce the truck before the trial court whenever required.

4. The petitioner shall not dispose of the truck without the permission of the trial court.

The Court also directed the trial court to ensure that the conditions imposed were complied with and that the truck was released to the petitioner as soon as possible.

In conclusion, the present case involved a petition filed under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside an order refusing to release a truck seized as case property. The Supreme Court relied on its earlier judgment in the case of Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai to allow the petition and direct the trial court to release the truck subject to certain conditions. The Court held that the truck was not the subject matter of the offence and that its continued detention would cause hardship to the petitioner. The Court also directed the trial court to ensure that the conditions imposed were complied with and that the truck was released to the petitioner as soon as possible.
