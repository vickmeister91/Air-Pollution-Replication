The Supreme Court of India recently heard a case involving Keystone Realtors Pvt. Ltd. and Anil V. Tharthare regarding an order from the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT had found that Keystone Realtors had undertaken an "expansion" without complying with regulatory procedures and directed them to deposit one crore rupees with the Central Pollution Control Board. The dispute raised questions about the interpretation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification and how the "expansion" of existing projects should be construed.

The appellant had expanded the Oriana Residential Project in Mumbai, increasing the total construction area to 40,480.88 square meters. The grant of an Environmental Clearance (EC) was conditional on obtaining consent from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. The issue in this case is whether an "amended" EC granted without following the procedure stipulated in paragraph 7(ii) is valid. The appellant argues that the increase in construction area was only marginal and did not require a fresh EC, while the first respondent argues that any expansion beyond the lower threshold limit requires a fresh EC. The court must determine whether the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEIAA) followed the correct procedure in granting the amended EC.

The court order discusses the requirements for obtaining an environmental clearance (EC) for construction projects under the EIA Notification. Paragraph 7(ii) states that any expansion beyond the "threshold limit" requires a fresh EC, and all applications for an EC must be made in Form 1 and be appraised by the Expert Appraisal Committee or State Level Expert Appraisal Committee. The court concludes that even if an expansion is within the upper limit prescribed in the Schedule, a fresh application for environmental clearance is required if the project is expanded beyond the limits for which the prior clearance was obtained. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental impact assessment and the precautionary principle in environmental law. The court also notes that the requirement of environmental clearance at the time of expansion forms a critical step in the environmental clearance regime and assists officials in evaluating and mitigating any adverse impact caused by the expansion.

The court order discusses the interpretation of paragraphs 2 and 7 of the EIA Notification, which require environmental clearance for projects and expansions. The court emphasizes the need for proper scrutiny and evaluation of environmental impact when a project undergoes expansion. The appellant in this case did not follow the proper procedure for expansion and completed construction before the environmental impact could be evaluated. The court upholds the directions of the NGT and orders an expert committee to evaluate the project's impact and suggest remedial measures. The appeal is dismissed and there will be no order as to costs.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of following proper procedures for obtaining environmental clearance for construction projects and expansions. The court emphasizes the need for environmental impact assessment and the precautionary principle in environmental law. The court also notes that the requirement of environmental clearance at the time of expansion forms a critical step in the environmental clearance regime and assists officials in evaluating and mitigating any adverse impact caused by the expansion. The court upholds the directions of the NGT and orders an expert committee to evaluate the project's impact and suggest remedial measures.
