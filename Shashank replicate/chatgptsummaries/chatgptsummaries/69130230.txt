The court order pertains to four Criminal Miscellaneous Petitions filed by four accused persons facing trial under section 342, 365 and 120-B IPC. The petitioners had filed applications under section 91 Cr. P.C., seeking directions to CBI to supply certain documents and statements allegedly in possession of CBI. The trial court dismissed the applications, and the petitioners challenged the order on the grounds that the trial court had not given reasons for rejecting the application and had not considered if the documents were essential for the defense of the accused. The court allowed reporters of local papers to see the judgment and ordered that the judgment should be reported in Digest.

The court order discusses the importance of a fair trial and the rights of the accused to access relevant documents and statements during the trial. The court emphasizes that the trial must be fair not only to the accused but also to the society, victim, and witnesses. The court also notes that the accused cannot demand access to all statements and documents collected during the investigation, but only those relevant to their defense. The court rejects the accused's application for production of certain documents, stating that they were not necessary or relevant to the case.

The court order discusses the provisions of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which empowers a court to summon or order the production of any document that it deems necessary or desirable for the purpose of inquiry or trial. However, the accused cannot demand the production of documents as a matter of right and must specify the document and show its relevance. The court can only decide if the documents sought to be summoned are necessary or desirable for the just decision of the case if the accused discloses the nature of the document and its relevance. The accused cannot make frivolous applications to scuttle the trial and stall the examination or cross-examination of witnesses. The court dismissed the applications made by the accused as they did not show the relevancy of the alleged undisclosed documents and were made with the intention to delay the trial.
