The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by M/S Soni Granites against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners sought to quash an order passed by the C.J. (Jr.Dn) and J.M.F.C., Kanakapura in C.C.No.26/2007, which took cognizance against the petitioners for the offence P/U/S 33(2) & 73(d) of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, Rule 25(2)(3) & (6) & Rule 144 of the Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 and Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 and ordered to register a case and issue summons in so far as the same relates to the petitioners/accused No.1 to 4.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the proceedings, stating that the procedure adopted by the respondents was without jurisdiction and fell foul of Section 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The State was not precluded from instituting a fresh proceeding in accordance with the law in respect of the alleged offence.

The case in question involves allegations of violations of various forest laws by the petitioners, M/S Soni Granites. The State of Karnataka had initiated proceedings against the petitioners under several provisions of the Karnataka Forest Act, 1963, the Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969, and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The petitioners had challenged the order passed by the C.J. (Jr.Dn) and J.M.F.C., Kanakapura, which had taken cognizance of the case against them and ordered the registration of a case and the issuance of summons.

The court, in its order, noted that the procedure adopted by the respondents was without jurisdiction and fell foul of Section 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The court observed that the respondents had failed to follow the mandatory provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and had not obtained the necessary sanction for prosecution from the competent authority. The court also noted that the respondents had not followed the procedure prescribed under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for taking cognizance of the offence.

The court further observed that the respondents had not followed the procedure prescribed under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for conducting an inquiry into the case. The court noted that the respondents had not examined any witnesses or recorded any statements before taking cognizance of the case. The court also observed that the respondents had not given the petitioners an opportunity to be heard before taking cognizance of the case.

The court, therefore, held that the procedure adopted by the respondents was without jurisdiction and quashed the proceedings against the petitioners. The court, however, clarified that the State was not precluded from instituting a fresh proceeding in accordance with the law in respect of the alleged offence.

The court's order in this case highlights the importance of following the mandatory provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, while initiating criminal proceedings. The court has emphasized that the failure to follow the prescribed procedure can render the proceedings without jurisdiction and can result in the quashing of the proceedings. The court's order also underscores the importance of giving the accused an opportunity to be heard before taking cognizance of the case.
