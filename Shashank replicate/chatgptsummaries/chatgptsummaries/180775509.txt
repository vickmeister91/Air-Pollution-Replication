The court order in question pertains to a revision application filed by the petitioners challenging an order passed by the Sessions Judge-1st, Jamtara in Criminal Appeal No.6 of 2010. The order directed the petitioners to collect original certificates from the department and deposit them in court for proper adjudication of the case. The petitioners were accused of obtaining appointment on the basis of forged certificates. The trial court acquitted them of the charges, but the state preferred an appeal. During the pendency of the appeal, the state filed an application under Section 91 of Cr.P.C. praying to summon the respondents to submit mark sheet, diploma certificate, and registration certificate of A.N.M. The court allowed the application, directing the petitioners to produce the original documents. The petitioners challenged the order, stating that it violated Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, which prohibits compelling an accused to produce evidence against themselves. The court set aside the impugned order and directed the court below to dispose of the appeal expeditiously.
