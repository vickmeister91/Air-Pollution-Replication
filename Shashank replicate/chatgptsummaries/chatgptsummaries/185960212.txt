The court order pertains to four different cases related to the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The first case was filed by Sri D.V. Girish and others against the Government of Karnataka regarding the use of forest land for a proposed eco-tourism project. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the land was part of a wildlife sanctuary and an injunction against the project. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the first appellate court upheld the decision. The plaintiffs appealed to the high court, arguing that the lower courts erred in their interpretation of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The high court admitted the appeal and will consider whether the lower courts were wrong in holding that the Act did not apply to the case.

The second case discussed in the court order involves the defendants clearing forest land for a proposed project without prior approval from the Central Government. The plaintiff argued that the lower courts failed to consider evidence and wrongly interpreted the law. The court examines Section 2 of the Act, which restricts the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval. The defendants admitted to taking up a project in the Bhadra Tiger reserve area without approval. The court examines the proposed work and finds that it involves clearing forest land for non-forest purposes, which is prohibited under the Act. The court concludes that the lower courts' findings were contrary to the mandatory provisions of the law and allows the plaintiff's appeal.

The third case discussed in the court order involves the defendant undertaking construction work in a nature camp without obtaining prior approval from the Central Government as required under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court found that the works undertaken were not just development of existing buildings but also involved new constructions. The court held that the works were not ancillary to the management and development of forest wildlife and therefore, Section 2 of the Act was applicable. The court ordered the defendant to submit their proposal for post-facto approval/sanction to the Central Government within six months and restrained them from carrying out any further constructions without prior approval. The court also directed the defendant to demolish any structures set up contrary to Section 2 of the Act if they fail to secure approval within the given period.

The fourth case discussed in the court order is related to the government giving post-facto approval or sanction within six months for structures that were set up contrary to Section 2 of the Act. If the government fails to do so, the structures will be demolished. The appeal has been disposed of.

In the first case, the plaintiffs argued that the land in question was part of a wildlife sanctuary and therefore, the proposed eco-tourism project should not be allowed. The lower courts dismissed the suit, but the high court admitted the appeal and will consider whether the lower courts were wrong in holding that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 did not apply to the case. The Act restricts the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval. The high court will examine whether the proposed eco-tourism project falls under the purview of the Act.

In the second case, the defendants admitted to taking up a project in the Bhadra Tiger reserve area without approval. The court examined the proposed work and found that it involved clearing forest land for non-forest purposes, which is prohibited under the Act. The court allowed the plaintiff's appeal and held that the lower courts' findings were contrary to the mandatory provisions of the law.

In the third case, the defendant undertook construction work in a nature camp without obtaining prior approval from the Central Government as required under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court held that the works were not ancillary to the management and development of forest wildlife and therefore, Section 2 of the Act was applicable. The court ordered the defendant to submit their proposal for post-facto approval/sanction to the Central Government within six months and restrained them from carrying out any further constructions without prior approval. The court also directed the defendant to demolish any structures set up contrary to Section 2 of the Act if they fail to secure approval within the given period.

In the fourth case, the court ordered the government to give post-facto approval or sanction within six months for structures that were set up contrary to Section 2 of the Act. If the government fails to do so, the structures will be demolished. The appeal has been disposed of.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before undertaking any project on forest land. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 restricts the use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval, and the court has upheld this provision in all the cases discussed in the order. The court has also emphasized the need to protect wildlife and forest areas and has ordered the demolition of any structures set up contrary to the Act.
