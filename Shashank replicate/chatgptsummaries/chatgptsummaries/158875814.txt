The State of Kerala has filed an appeal against a judgment in a writ petition that allowed a company to continue manufacturing mineral water without an environmental clearance. The petitioner argued that they did not require clearance and that the Wildlife Warden had no authority to issue a stop memo. The Forest Department relied on a Buffer Zone notification to restrict the industry within the Buffer Zone declared, which is in the interest of the National Park and to ensure the protection of the environment and wildlife.

The court found that the petitioner's industry had no impact on the environment and that the report submitted by the petitioner was self-serving and unreliable. The court also found that the Hon'ble Supreme Court's order did not speak of implementation and that the Temporary Working Permits should not result in any mining activities being carried on within the safety zones around a National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary.

The court order states that Temporary Working Permits can only be granted if certain conditions are met, and that mining activities cannot be carried out within 1 km of a National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary. The court found that a draft notification has been brought out for the specific area around Western Ghats, but it does not prohibit the operation of a "Green Category" industry in the ESA.

The court also notes that the issue of ground water depletion is still alive and that the District Collector should examine whether the petitioner is using excessive ground water. The Ground Water Act, 2002 provides for the conservation of ground water and for regulation and control of its extraction and use in the State of Kerala. The District Collector would have to first look at whether the area where the petitioner's industry is situated is a notified area under the Ground Water Act.

The court order states that if the petitioner's industry is situated in a notified area under the Ground Water Act, then no extraction or use of water can be made other than for own use or for social purposes, and only under a permit granted under the Act. If the area is not notified, then the Ground Water Act would not be applicable, and the remedy of the additional respondents would be to approach the Ground Water Authority to recommend notification of the area. The matter is relegated to the District Collector for consideration of the issue under the Ground Water Act, and a meeting of various departments and authorities is to be convened to take a decision on the matter.

The court also notes that the petitioner's manufacturing activity of plastic bottles may not be permissible, and there is a chance of emission of effluents, which has to be looked into by the Pollution Control Board. The writ appeal is dismissed, and parties are left to suffer their respective costs.

In summary, the court found that the petitioner's industry had no impact on the environment and that the report submitted by the petitioner was self-serving and unreliable.
