The court recently granted anticipatory bail to Pradeep Vasnik in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act for the death of a blue bull due to electrocution. The petitioner had already been released on regular bail in a separate case for the death of a person due to electrocution on the same night. The court allowed the bail application considering the facts and circumstances of the case and directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond and a solvent surety for his appearance before the trial court.

The case in question pertains to the death of a blue bull due to electrocution, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The petitioner, Pradeep Vasnik, was accused of setting up an illegal electric fence around his agricultural land, which resulted in the death of the blue bull. The incident took place on the same night as another incident where a person had died due to electrocution, and the petitioner was also accused in that case.

The petitioner had already been released on regular bail in the case related to the death of the person due to electrocution. However, he was still under investigation for the death of the blue bull, and hence, he filed an anticipatory bail application in the court. The court considered the facts and circumstances of the case and granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner.

The court directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond and a solvent surety for his appearance before the trial court. This means that the petitioner has to provide a guarantee that he will appear before the trial court whenever required. The personal bond is a written undertaking by the petitioner that he will comply with the conditions of the bail and will appear before the trial court whenever required. The solvent surety is a guarantee provided by a third party that the petitioner will comply with the conditions of the bail and will appear before the trial court whenever required.

The court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner was based on the facts and circumstances of the case. The court considered the fact that the petitioner had already been released on regular bail in the case related to the death of the person due to electrocution. The court also considered the fact that the petitioner had no previous criminal record and was not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

In conclusion, the court granted anticipatory bail to Pradeep Vasnik in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act for the death of a blue bull due to electrocution. The court allowed the bail application considering the facts and circumstances of the case and directed the petitioner to furnish a personal bond and a solvent surety for his appearance before the trial court.
