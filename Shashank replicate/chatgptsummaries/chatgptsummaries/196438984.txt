The petitions addressed issues such as pollution, loss of ecology, and compensation for affected parties. The court order did not provide a specific ruling or outcome of the petitions.

The court order listed multiple petitions filed by various organizations against the government of Tamil Nadu, the Department of Environment and Forests, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and other parties regarding the protection of the Noyyal River and its surrounding areas. The petitions included demands for compensation for loss of ecology, prevention of pollution, and protection of the river's ayacutdars (irrigation beneficiaries). The respondents included district collectors, a bank, and various associations.

The court order involved multiple petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, with various petitioners seeking the quashing of a government order that orders compensation to be paid to only one association for the pollution of the Noyyal river. The petitioners were seeking the disbursement of compensation to all affected farmers in the Noyyal Basin. The court was also being asked to direct the respondents to assess the damage caused to each member of the petitioner associations, award compensation for both loss of ecology and resultant loss of livelihoods, health, etc., and make alternative arrangements for the supply of water for irrigation.

The court order directed respondents 1 to 3 and 5 to assess the damage caused to each member of the petitioner Association, award compensation for both loss of ecology and resultant loss of livelihoods, health, etc., and for remediation from 1996 till the current period, recover the same from the members of the 7th respondent Association. The court also considered whether members of the 4th respondent alone were entitled to the amount of Rs.75.00 Crores deposited by the polluting units in pursuance to the order in a Public Interest Litigation W.P.No.29791 of 2003 in preference to other affected agriculturists of Noyyal River Basin identified by Loss of Ecology Authority (LoEA). The background of the case was that due to rapid and haphazard industrialization of Tiruppur with a large number of hosiery units and consequential establishment of dyeing and bleaching units resulted in Noyyal River getting polluted causing havoc to the agricultural operations.

The court order pertained to a case involving pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching industries in the Noyyal River Basin in Tamil Nadu. The Loss of Ecology Authority (LoEA) assessed the damage caused and awarded compensation to affected agriculturists. The court directed the polluting units to deposit the compensation amount and an adhoc compensation amount towards estimated loss. The deposited amount was to be used for cleaning the Orathapalayam dam and Noyyal River and for payment to affected agriculturists. The Tiruppur Dyeing Factory Owners Association challenged the closure of dyeing units and deposited Rs.25 crore before the High Court. The government issued a controversial order directing the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to disburse Rs.75 crore to the Noyyal Ayacutdars Protection Association for payment to its members. The writ petitioners, who were affected agriculturists, challenged the order, alleging that it gave preferential treatment to the Association and caused prejudice to other affected farmers.

The court order pertained to a dispute over the distribution of compensation for damage caused to agricultural land due to pollution caused by dyeing and bleaching units in Tiruppur. The petitioners contended that the government's order to give Rs. 75 crores as compensation to only 535 members of the Noyyal River Ayacutdars Protection Association was arbitrary and gave preferential treatment to them at the cost of other affected agriculturists. The court was tasked with determining whether the compensation should be restricted to only the members of the association or distributed to all affected agriculturists, and whether the government's order was arbitrary and liable to be quashed.

The court order directed the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board to repay an advance of Rs.75.00 crores along with interest to the government within 6 months. The Board was also directed to follow up with the Petitioner's Association for permitting the withdrawal of the fine amounts available with the Hon'ble High Court of Madras and Collector, Tirupur and take action to close the cases filed in this regard. The order also included various directions related to cleaning up the Orathapalayam dam and Noyyal river, and the payment of compensation to affected farmers. The court provided a detailed statement showing the details of the amount collected/deposited and the balance available for compensation to the affected farmers.
