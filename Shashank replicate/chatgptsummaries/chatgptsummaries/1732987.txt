The court order pertains to two separate cases, both of which involve appeals against assessment orders passed by government authorities. In the first case, the petitioner filed 12 appeals against assessment orders passed by the Cess Officer, U.P. Pollution Control Board, Lucknow relating to the period 1994 to 2007. The appeals were filed under Section 13 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977 read with Rule 9 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Rules, 1978. However, the appeals were filed beyond the prescribed period of limitation, which is only thirty days from the date of communication of the order of assessment. The power to condone delay in filing an appeal is also limited up to 45 days. As a result, the appellate authority rejected all the appeals on November 15, 2007.

The court order discusses the limitations and procedures for filing an appeal against an order of assessment or penalty. The court emphasizes that the period of limitation is prescribed under the statute and cannot be extended beyond the specified time frame. The court also notes that while procedures should facilitate justice, they cannot be construed in a technical sense that leaves no room for reasonable interpretation. The court ultimately upholds the decision not to condone the delay in filing the appeals in this case, as no justification was provided for the delay.

In the second case, the court order deals with the issue of extensions of time for court proceedings and recovery proceedings for tax dues. The court notes that extensions of time for court proceedings will only be granted in exceptional circumstances and must be recorded in writing. Defendants cannot seek extensions of time if the court finds that they have been negligent or lax. The court may impose costs to deter defendants from seeking extensions of time and to compensate plaintiffs for any delay caused.

The order also discusses the issue of recovery proceedings and whether they are barred by limitation. The court finds that recovery proceedings for tax dues are not subject to any period of limitation under the Limitation Act. However, the court notes that inordinate delays in initiating recovery proceedings are not acceptable and directs an inquiry into the matter.

In this case, the petitioner was allowed to pay the balance amount in four quarterly installments, with the first installment due by March 31, 2008. This decision was made in light of the fact that the petitioner had already paid a substantial amount towards the tax dues and had expressed a willingness to pay the remaining amount in installments. The court also directed the authorities to ensure that the petitioner was not subjected to any coercive measures during the pendency of the case.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of adhering to prescribed procedures and timelines in legal matters. It also emphasizes the need for courts to balance the interests of both parties and ensure that justice is served in a fair and reasonable manner.
