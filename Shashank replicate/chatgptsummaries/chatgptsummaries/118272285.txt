A recent court order pertains to a criminal revision case against an order passed by a Special Judge in a case related to theft of electricity. The revisionist had moved an application under section 233 (3) Cr.P.C. for summoning various documents and witnesses, which was partly allowed by the trial court. However, the revisionist had sought to summon an inquiry report submitted by an inquiry committee, which was rejected by the trial court. The court held that the inquiry report was relevant for the just decision of the case and should have been summoned. The court allowed the revision and modified the trial court's order to summon the inquiry report through a competent person.
