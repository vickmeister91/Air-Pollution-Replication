Matadeen S/o Shri Kedar was granted bail by the court in connection with FIR No.124/2019 Registered at Police Station Nihalganj, Dholpur for the offences under Sections 332, 353, 307, 379, 336, 279 & 34 of IPC and Section 3/25 of the Arms Act and Sections 29, 51 & 52 of the Wild Life Protection Act and Section 41 & 42 of the Rajasthan Forest Act. The court ordered him to furnish a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each to the satisfaction of the learned trial Judge for his appearance before the court concerned on all the dates of hearing as and when called upon to do so.

The charges against Matadeen S/o Shri Kedar were serious and included offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Wild Life Protection Act, and Rajasthan Forest Act. The court, however, deemed it fit to grant him bail on the condition that he furnishes a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. This bond is to ensure that he appears before the court on all the dates of hearing as and when called upon to do so.

The decision to grant bail to Matadeen S/o Shri Kedar was likely based on several factors, including the nature of the charges against him, his criminal history, and the strength of the evidence against him. The court may have also taken into account his personal circumstances, such as his age, health, and family situation.

It is important to note that bail is not a guarantee of innocence. It simply means that the accused is allowed to remain out of custody while the trial is ongoing. The accused is still required to appear before the court on all the dates of hearing and comply with any other conditions set by the court.

In this case, Matadeen S/o Shri Kedar will have to comply with the conditions set by the court in order to remain out of custody. Failure to do so could result in the revocation of his bail and his arrest.

Overall, the decision to grant bail to Matadeen S/o Shri Kedar is a reminder of the importance of the legal system in ensuring that justice is served. While the charges against him are serious, the court has deemed it fit to grant him bail on certain conditions. It is now up to him to comply with these conditions and prove his innocence in the trial.
