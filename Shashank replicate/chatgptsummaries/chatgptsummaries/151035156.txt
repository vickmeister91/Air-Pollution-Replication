The court recently granted bail to Ramesh and Mulu Singh, who were arrested for hunting a wild boar in violation of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court found that there was no evidence connecting the applicants to the crime, and their further custody was not necessary. The applicants were ordered to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety, and to comply with the conditions of Section 437 of the Cr.P.C.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is a comprehensive law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, including wild boars, without a license or permit from the government. The Act also provides for penalties for violations of its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

In this case, Ramesh and Mulu Singh were arrested for hunting a wild boar without a license or permit from the government. The police claimed to have found evidence linking the applicants to the crime, including weapons and ammunition used in the hunting. However, the court found that the evidence was not sufficient to establish the guilt of the applicants beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court noted that the applicants had no criminal record and were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence if released on bail. The court also observed that the offense for which the applicants were charged was bailable, and that their further custody was not necessary for the purpose of investigation or trial.

Accordingly, the court granted bail to the applicants on the condition that they furnish a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 each with a solvent surety. The court also directed the applicants to comply with the conditions of Section 437 of the Cr.P.C., which require them to appear before the court as and when required, not to leave the country without the permission of the court, and not to commit any offense while on bail.

The grant of bail in this case highlights the importance of the presumption of innocence and the need for evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's decision also underscores the importance of complying with the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and the penalties for violations of its provisions.
