The issue of pollution caused by tanneries and dying factories in the Erode district of Tamil Nadu, India, has been a long-standing problem. The People Health and Development Council filed a writ petition to close down 34 tanneries in the district for causing severe water, air, and soil pollution. The tanneries were functioning without proper authorization and in violation of all laws. The effluents from the tanneries have contaminated the ground water and caused financial hardship to local farmers. 

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has issued a direction for all 44 tanneries, including the 34 mentioned in the petition, to shift their industrial activity to the SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre (SIGC) and implement a comprehensive treatment proposal for zero discharge of effluent to protect and prevent water sources. The tanneries have been exhorted to implement Reserve Osmosis (R.O.)/other membrane technologies with suitable evaporation systems for the disposal of rejects, to achieve zero discharge. 

The court order emphasizes the importance of protecting the environment and preventing pollution, as mandated by the Constitution and various Acts and Rules. The court notes that the tanneries have been polluting the environment for over a decade and must pay pollution fines and compensate affected persons. The court also mentions the remedial measures taken by the government, such as setting up an industrial growth center to accommodate various industries.

The court order also discusses the issue of tanneries in Erode District and their discharge of high levels of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) into water sources. The court notes that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board has directed the tanneries to shift their operations to the SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre (SIGC) and implement a comprehensive treatment proposal for zero discharge of effluent. The court suggests the implementation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems to control TDS levels in effluent. The tanneries are granted an extension until August 31, 2005, to comply with the directive, and those who do not wish to adopt the RO system are free to shift their operations to SIGC. 

The court emphasizes the importance of protecting life, health, and ecology over employment and revenue. The court recognizes that the tanneries provide employment and revenue to the local community, but the protection of the environment and public health must take precedence. The court also notes that the tanneries have been given ample time to comply with the directive and that those who do not comply will face legal consequences.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the importance of protecting the environment and public health over employment and revenue. The tanneries in Erode District have been polluting the environment for over a decade, and the court has directed them to shift their operations to the SIPCOT Industrial Growth Centre and implement a comprehensive treatment proposal for zero discharge of effluent. The court suggests the implementation of Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems to control TDS levels in effluent. The tanneries have been given ample time to comply with the directive, and those who do not comply will face legal consequences. The court's decision is a step towards protecting the environment and public health in the Erode district.
