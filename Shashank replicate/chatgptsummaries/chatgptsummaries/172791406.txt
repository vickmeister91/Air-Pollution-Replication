The first court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri B R Shivakumar Singh, seeking to quash the order passed by the Director of Mines and Geology rejecting his application for a prospecting license for white clay. The petitioner had applied for the license in 1993, but it was rejected due to objections from the public and villagers. The petitioner filed multiple petitions over the years, but the latest order was made in 2012 rejecting his application. The court upheld the rejection, stating that the petitioner did not have any intention to mine white clay and was only seeking the license to eventually obtain a mining lease for iron-ore and manganese.

The court observed that the petitioner had not obtained any clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act and did not have any positive opinion from the Forest Department. The petitioner's credentials as a genuine applicant were also doubtful. The government has the power to refuse the grant of a prospecting license, and the petitioner's application has been rejected several times. The court noted that the petitioner had been abusing the court process to keep the application alive for over two decades.

The court order further stated that the petitioner had not made any efforts to obtain the necessary clearances and had not even submitted a mining plan. The court observed that the petitioner had not shown any interest in mining white clay and was only interested in obtaining a mining lease for iron-ore and manganese. The court held that the petitioner's application was rightly rejected by the Director of Mines and Geology.

The second court order pertains to the same case and dismisses the petitioner's present petition with exemplary cost quantified at `.1 lakh, which shall be paid by the petitioner to respondent No.1. The court observed that the petitioner had repeatedly applied for a prospective license without obtaining clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act and without any positive opinion from the Forest Department. The court noted that the petitioner's credentials as a genuine applicant were doubtful and that the government had the power to refuse the grant of a prospecting license.

The court further observed that the petitioner had been abusing the court process to keep the application alive for over two decades. The court held that the petitioner had not made any efforts to obtain the necessary clearances and had not even submitted a mining plan. The court noted that the petitioner was only interested in obtaining a mining lease for iron-ore and manganese and had no intention of mining white clay.

In conclusion, the court upheld the rejection of the petitioner's application for a prospecting license for white clay and dismissed the present petition with exemplary cost quantified at `.1 lakh, which shall be paid by the petitioner to respondent No.1. The court observed that the petitioner had been abusing the court process to keep the application alive for over two decades and had not made any efforts to obtain the necessary clearances or submit a mining plan. The court held that the petitioner's credentials as a genuine applicant were doubtful and that the government had the power to refuse the grant of a prospecting license.
