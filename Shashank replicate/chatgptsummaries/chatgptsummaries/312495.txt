The court order pertains to a group of medical officers who were selected through RPSC and appointed as Medical Officer/Civil Assistant Surgeon. They filed writ petitions challenging a circular/instruction issued by the University of Rajasthan for Pre-P.G. Medical Examination 2004 for admission to MD/MS/Diploma Courses, which allowed adhoc/temporary/contract employees to appear in the said examination in the category of 'in-service'. The petitioners argued that all those candidates who are working on adhoc/temporary/consolidated salary should not be treated as 'in-service' candidates and their merit should be determined along with general candidates.

The court found that the criteria laid down by the state government for eligibility to appear in the Pre P.G. Medical Examination were not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder. The court order ends Ordinance 278-E of the Rajasthan University Act, which had no fixed reservation for in-service candidates. The state government is competent to issue instructions and guidelines for admission to Pre. PG. Courses, as long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder. The Medical Council of India provides standard education for the guidance of universities. The University of Rajasthan is only empowered to hold examinations and confer degrees, while the state government issues instructions regarding eligibility criteria. The state government cannot issue any instruction contrary to regulations, and for making amendments in the Ordinance or statute, the procedure prescribed in Statute must be complied with.

The court allowed the doctors who are working as temporary/consolidated/adhoc to appear for counselling provisionally subject to the decision of the writ petition and shall not create any equity in their favour. The court also modified the order and directed the respondents to consider the aforesaid categories provisionally in their respective superspeciality course for reshuffling subject to the decision of the writ petition and it will not create any equity in their favour. The petitioners argued that the government cannot extend the benefit of in-service category to any Doctors working dehors the rules.

The court order discusses a case regarding eligibility criteria for doctors appearing in the Pre P.G. Medical Examination 2004 for admission to MD/MS/Diploma Courses. The state government had laid down a criteria that doctors who had served in rural or hilly areas for three years were eligible to appear in the exam. The court found that this criteria was not in contravention of any provisions of law and that the doctors who had participated in the exam and were now challenging the eligibility criteria were estopped from doing so. However, the court criticized the state government for changing the eligibility criteria every year and creating confusion for the doctors. The court suggested that the state government should lay down a firm policy and instruct the university to carry out necessary amendments in the ordinance to avoid unwarranted litigations in the future. The writ petition was dismissed with no orders as to costs.
