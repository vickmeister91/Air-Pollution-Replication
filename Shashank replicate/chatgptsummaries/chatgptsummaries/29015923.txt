The court order in question pertains to a petition for Special Leave to Appeal filed by Mr. Nipun Malhotra against the Government of NCT of Delhi and others. The case was heard by the court, which decided that, considering the dispute involved in the matter, it would be appropriate for the case to be heard by the bench hearing W.P.(C) No.13029/1985 (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India & Ors.), as a similar issue is involved in that matter. The case was listed for the next day after obtaining orders from the Chief Justice of India.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the background of the case. Mr. Nipun Malhotra had filed a petition against the Government of NCT of Delhi and others, alleging that the government had failed to provide adequate facilities for persons with disabilities in the city. The petition sought directions from the court to the government to take necessary steps to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to public buildings, transport, and other facilities.

During the hearing of the case, the court noted that a similar issue was involved in W.P.(C) No.13029/1985 (M.C. Mehta v. Union of India & Ors.), which was being heard by a different bench. The court observed that it would be appropriate for the two cases to be heard together, as they involved similar issues and could benefit from a consolidated hearing.

The court's decision to refer the case to the bench hearing W.P.(C) No.13029/1985 has several implications. First, it means that the case will now be heard by a different bench, which may have a different perspective on the issues involved. This could potentially lead to a different outcome for the case.

Second, the decision to consolidate the two cases could have significant benefits for persons with disabilities in Delhi. By hearing the two cases together, the court will be able to consider the issues involved in a more comprehensive manner, and may be able to arrive at a more effective solution to the problems faced by persons with disabilities in the city.

Overall, the court's decision to refer the case to the bench hearing W.P.(C) No.13029/1985 is a significant development in the ongoing efforts to improve facilities for persons with disabilities in Delhi. It remains to be seen how the case will be decided, but the consolidation of the two cases is a positive step towards addressing the issues faced by this vulnerable section of society.
