In the first court order, the case pertains to M/s. Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited, which had applied for environmental clearance for the expansion of its existing plant. The National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA) granted clearance, which was challenged by Jan Chetna, a representative body of those affected by the clearance. The Delhi High Court entertained the petition filed by Jan Chetna as a Public Interest Litigation and set aside the NEAA order, remanding the case to the competent quasi-judicial forum for being decided on merits. However, the Supreme Court heard the case and overruled the Delhi High Court's decision, stating that the Delhi High Court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by Jan Chetna.

The second court order specifies the jurisdiction of a single judge and benches of the court. It states that certain cases should be heard by a single judge, while others require a bench of two judges. The order also emphasizes the importance of following relevant rules and not violating statutory provisions specifying jurisdiction. The appeal in question is allowed, and the writ petition filed by the respondent is to be listed before a single judge of the high court. The court has not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case, and the parties are free to advance all legally permissible arguments before the learned single judge.

In the first court order, the Supreme Court overruled the Delhi High Court's decision to set aside the NEAA order granting environmental clearance to M/s. Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited. The Supreme Court held that the Delhi High Court did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by Jan Chetna as a Public Interest Litigation. The Supreme Court stated that the jurisdiction to hear such cases lies with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and not with the high courts. The Supreme Court also observed that the Delhi High Court had erred in setting aside the NEAA order without considering the merits of the case.

The Supreme Court further held that the NEAA had followed the correct procedure in granting environmental clearance to M/s. Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited. The Supreme Court noted that the NEAA had considered all relevant factors and had imposed appropriate conditions to ensure that the expansion of the plant did not cause any harm to the environment. The Supreme Court also observed that the NEAA had taken into account the concerns raised by Jan Chetna and had addressed them adequately.

In the second court order, the court emphasized the importance of following relevant rules and not violating statutory provisions specifying jurisdiction. The court stated that certain cases should be heard by a single judge, while others require a bench of two judges. The court also allowed the appeal in question and directed that the writ petition filed by the respondent be listed before a single judge of the high court.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following the correct procedure and jurisdiction in legal matters. The first court order emphasizes the need for petitioners to approach the correct forum for their grievances, while the second court order emphasizes the importance of following relevant rules and not violating statutory provisions specifying jurisdiction. Both court orders serve as reminders to litigants and legal practitioners to be mindful of these important considerations in their legal proceedings.
