The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by Mahender Kumar Sharda against an order passed by the trial court dismissing his application under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Section 145 & 155 of Indian Evidence Act. The case against Sharda is based on a complaint filed by Hari Om Maheshwari alleging that Sharda committed frauds in his firm and encashed a cheque belonging to Maheshwari's concern.

The trial court dismissed Sharda's application, and he filed a revision petition against the order.

The court dismissed the revision petition and stated that the trial court should proceed with the trial without being influenced by the order.
