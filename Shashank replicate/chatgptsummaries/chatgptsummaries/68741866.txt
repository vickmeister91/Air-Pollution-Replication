The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Prahlad @ Satpal against the State of Rajasthan and others regarding the pollution of water in minor canals passing through Sri Ganganagar district. The case was initially filed by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Rajasthan Pradesh, and was transferred to the National Green Tribunal for adjudication. The NGT passed various orders directing the state to take effective measures to remove inlets discharging filthy substances or water into the canal and to remove all such platforms raised on the canal. The state was also directed to provide safe drinking water to affected villages by transporting drinking water.

The court ordered the state to prepare a comprehensive and short-term scheme with a time frame for preventing the discharge of untreated effluent into the canal and a long-term scheme for the removal of encroachments situated on the water bodies. The State Pollution Control Board was directed to inspect and file a status report on whether the drinking water supplied after treatment meets the standard of drinking water.

The court order directs the State Pollution Control Board to collect water samples from distributories and potable water rendered there-from, analyze them, and place the analysis reports before the court. The state is directed to construct waste water drains and remove encroachments along the distributories and canal within a given time frame. The court imposes damages or compensation of Rs. 1,000/- on a person found contaminating any distributory or canal water and directs citizens to be made aware of this direction. The court also directs the District Collector, Ganga Nagar, to be present with all relevant records on the next posting date. The state is warned that if it fails to submit the short term and long term scheme and the action taken report, the cost would be imposed.

The court order discusses the removal of encroachments in Sriganganagar and the steps being taken to mark and remove them. The court directs the state government to remove all encroachments within one month and to issue notices to those contributing to pollution to pay compensation. The court also orders the removal of existing structures causing contamination of canal water and directs the state to file a compliance report. The court expresses dissatisfaction with the state's compliance and warns of appropriate action if directions are not followed.

The court order discusses the issue of encroachment and pollution of the Indira Gandhi Canal in Ganganagar, Rajasthan. The court orders the District Collector to appear before the tribunal with relevant information and records. The court also suggests that aggrieved parties approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for relief, as the NGT has jurisdiction over matters related to pollution and environmental protection. The court also discusses the doctrine of exhausting all other remedies before approaching the writ court and notes that a writ in the nature of certiorari can be issued if an inferior court or tribunal of first instance has committed an error that cannot be cured or obliterated by adopting other statutory remedies.

The court order states that the tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction in a case where the original applicant is barred by limitation, and the issue has not yet been decided. The tribunal has the power to condone the delay in such cases, and the jurisdiction vested with the tribunal is very wide. The court is not inclined to invoke writ jurisdiction in this matter and dismisses the writ petition. The petitioner is allowed to withdraw the writ petition with the liberty to approach the NGT by filing an appropriate application/representation. The NGT possesses ample power to condone the delay, and the State authorities are restrained from taking any coercive action against the petitioner(s) until 31st December 2016. After that, the State would be free to proceed in accordance with further directions/orders passed by the NGT in the matters.
