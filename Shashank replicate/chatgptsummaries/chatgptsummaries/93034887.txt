The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. for quashing a complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Rangoli Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. and another. The petitioners, Mr. Sunil Shakdher and another, had sought the quashing of the complaint on the grounds that it could not have been filed against them in view of the grant of a "No Objection Certificate" issued by the Chairman, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, Panchkula.

The court found merit in the petitioners' contention and quashed the complaint along with all subsequent proceedings arising from it. The court's decision was based on the fact that the "No Objection Certificate" issued by the Chairman of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was a clear indication that the petitioners had complied with all the necessary environmental regulations and had obtained the necessary approvals for their project.

The court also noted that the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board was based on a report submitted by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board's Regional Office, which had not taken into account the "No Objection Certificate" issued by the Chairman of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The court held that the Regional Office's report was therefore flawed and could not be relied upon to initiate legal proceedings against the petitioners.

The court's decision in this case is significant as it underscores the importance of obtaining all necessary approvals and complying with all environmental regulations before undertaking any development project. It also highlights the need for government agencies to coordinate and communicate effectively with each other to avoid unnecessary legal disputes and delays in project implementation.

In conclusion, the court's decision to quash the complaint filed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board against M/s Rangoli Buildtech Pvt. Ltd. and another is a welcome development for the development sector in India. It sends a clear message that compliance with environmental regulations is essential for sustainable development and that government agencies must work together to ensure that all necessary approvals are obtained before any project is undertaken.
