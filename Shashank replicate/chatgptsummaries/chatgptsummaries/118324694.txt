The Gujarat High Court recently heard a case involving Sandeep Texturisers Private Limited, the purchaser of a property in an auction conducted by the Kalupur Commercial Cooperative Bank. The petitioner sought to quash demand notices issued by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board for water cess dues owed by the previous owner. The bank argued that it did not owe any liability for the payment of the dues, and the petitioner argued that the sale certificate and deed of indemnity did not make them liable for the dues.

The court examined relevant portions of the sale certificate and deed of indemnity and the Water Cess Act, 1977, and ultimately ruled in favor of the petitioner. The court order states that a local authority is liable to pay cess for water supplied, but if another local authority has already paid the cess, the first local authority is not liable to pay. The court also ruled that a petitioner who purchased a property in an auction is not responsible for paying the water cess dues of the previous owner.

The Gujarat Pollution Control Board was ordered to quash and set aside the demand notices issued to the petitioner. However, the Board can recover the dues through appropriate legal proceedings.

The case highlights the importance of understanding the legal implications of purchasing property in an auction. The petitioner was able to successfully argue that they were not liable for the water cess dues owed by the previous owner, based on the sale certificate and deed of indemnity. It is important for potential buyers to thoroughly review all relevant documents before making a purchase to avoid any unexpected liabilities.

The court's ruling also clarifies the liability of local authorities for water cess dues. The court stated that if another local authority has already paid the cess, the first local authority is not liable to pay. This ruling provides clarity on the issue and may help to prevent disputes between local authorities over the payment of water cess dues.

Overall, the court's ruling in this case provides important guidance on the legal implications of purchasing property in an auction and the liability of local authorities for water cess dues. It is important for potential buyers to carefully review all relevant documents and seek legal advice before making a purchase to avoid any unexpected liabilities.
