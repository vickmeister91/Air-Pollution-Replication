The court order in question pertains to a criminal revision filed by Gaurav Gupta against the State and Randeep Dhuliya. The revisionist sought to set aside an order passed by the Ld. MM-04 (NW), Rohini Courts, Delhi, which released birds and cages to respondent no. 2 on furnishing supardarinama in the sum of Rs. 20,000/-. The revisionist argued that the pigeons seized from the accused were wild animals and that the accused was guilty under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, modified the impugned order to the extent that the supardarinama furnished by the owner was cancelled, and the birds and cages were deposited in the Central Zoo, opp. Purana Quila, Ring Road, New Delhi, to be produced as and when required by the court during trial.

The case revolves around the seizure of pigeons from the accused, who was alleged to have violated the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The accused had furnished a supardarinama in the sum of Rs. 20,000/- and had been released along with the birds and cages. The revisionist, Gaurav Gupta, challenged this order on the grounds that the pigeons seized were wild animals and that the accused was guilty under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, modified the impugned order to the extent that the supardarinama furnished by the owner was cancelled, and the birds and cages were deposited in the Central Zoo, opp. Purana Quila, Ring Road, New Delhi, to be produced as and when required by the court during trial. This decision was made in light of the fact that the pigeons seized were indeed wild animals and that the accused was guilty under the provisions of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.

The court's decision to deposit the birds and cages in the Central Zoo, opp. Purana Quila, Ring Road, New Delhi, was a wise one. This will ensure that the birds are kept in a safe and secure environment and will be produced as and when required by the court during trial. It also sends a strong message to those who violate the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, that such violations will not be tolerated and that the law will be enforced to the fullest extent possible.

In conclusion, the court's decision to modify the impugned order and deposit the birds and cages in the Central Zoo, opp. Purana Quila, Ring Road, New Delhi, was a just and fair one. It ensures that the birds are kept in a safe and secure environment and will be produced as and when required by the court during trial. It also sends a strong message to those who violate the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, that such violations will not be tolerated and that the law will be enforced to the fullest extent possible.
