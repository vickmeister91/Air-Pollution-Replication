In a recent court order, four individuals accused of hunting a wild sambar deer and taking its meat in violation of the Kerala Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act were denied anticipatory bail. The accused, including three police officials, had filed the bail application claiming that they were not involved in the crime. However, the court found that all the accused had a specific role in the alleged act and therefore, denied the bail application.

The case pertains to the illegal hunting of a wild sambar deer, which is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. The accused were caught with the meat of the deer, which they had allegedly hunted in the forest. The forest officials had registered a case against the accused under various sections of the Kerala Forest Act and the Wildlife Protection Act.

The accused had filed an anticipatory bail application in the court, claiming that they were innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. They argued that they had no role in the alleged act and were not present at the scene of the crime. They also claimed that they were being targeted because of their profession as police officials.

However, the court found that the evidence presented by the forest officials was strong and pointed towards the involvement of all the accused in the crime. The court noted that the accused had been caught with the meat of the deer, which was a clear indication of their involvement in the illegal hunting. The court also observed that the accused had given conflicting statements during the investigation, which further strengthened the case against them.

The court further noted that the accused, being police officials, were expected to uphold the law and protect the wildlife. However, their alleged involvement in the illegal hunting of a protected species was a clear violation of their duty. The court observed that such acts of lawlessness by those entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the law cannot be tolerated.

In light of these observations, the court denied the anticipatory bail application filed by the accused. The court held that the accused had a specific role in the alleged act and that there was sufficient evidence to suggest their involvement in the crime. The court also noted that the accused were likely to abscond if granted bail, which would hamper the investigation.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to the denial of anticipatory bail to four individuals accused of hunting a wild sambar deer and taking its meat in violation of the Kerala Forest Act and the Wild Life Protection Act. The court found that all the accused had a specific role in the alleged act and that there was sufficient evidence to suggest their involvement in the crime. The court observed that such acts of lawlessness by those entrusted with the responsibility of upholding the law cannot be tolerated and therefore, denied the bail application.
