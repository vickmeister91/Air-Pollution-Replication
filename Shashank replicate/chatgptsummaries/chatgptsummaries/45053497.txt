In a recent court order, the case between Raymond Limited and Madhya Pradesh State was addressed. The notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 was set to be withdrawn, as stated by the respondents' counsel. This notice had been a point of contention between the two parties, and its withdrawal marks a significant development in the case.

The petitioners, in turn, sought permission to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. The court granted this prayer, allowing the petitions to be dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh, if needed. This decision provides the petitioners with the opportunity to revisit their case in the future, should they choose to do so.

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is a piece of legislation that seeks to regulate access to biological resources and associated knowledge, as well as to provide for their conservation and sustainable use. The Act establishes Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, as well as a National Biodiversity Authority at the national level, to oversee the implementation of its provisions.

In the case between Raymond Limited and Madhya Pradesh State, the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act had been a source of dispute. This section requires any person or organization seeking to access biological resources for commercial or research purposes to obtain prior approval from the Biodiversity Board. The notice in question had been issued to Raymond Limited, alleging that the company had violated this provision by accessing biological resources without obtaining the necessary approval.

Raymond Limited had challenged the notice, arguing that it had not violated any provisions of the Act. The company had also contended that the notice had been issued without following due process, and that it had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the notice was issued.

The court order, which allows for the withdrawal of the notice, effectively resolves this dispute. It is unclear what led to the decision to withdraw the notice, but it is likely that the respondents' counsel had made a compelling argument in favor of doing so.

The petitioners' request to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed is also significant. This request essentially allows the petitioners to keep their options open, should they wish to pursue the case further in the future. It is unclear what their reasons for seeking this permission were, but it is possible that they felt that they needed more time to gather evidence or build a stronger case.

Overall, the court order in the case between Raymond Limited and Madhya Pradesh State marks a significant development in the ongoing dispute between the two parties. The withdrawal of the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is a major victory for Raymond Limited, as it removes a significant obstacle in the company's path. The petitioners' request to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed also provides them with the opportunity to revisit their case in the future, should they choose to do so.
