The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving violations of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. In one case, Sushil Ansal and two others were charged with violating the Act, and they challenged the proceedings and orders passed by the court, including non-bailable warrants and proceedings under Section 82 Cr.P.C. However, the court dismissed the petition and upheld the previous orders.

In another case, the petitioners sought to quash proceedings against them in Criminal Case No. 13 and 14 of 1993, U.P. Pollution Control Board Vs. Ansal Papers and others pending before the Special Judicial Magistrate (Pollution) Lucknow. The court considered the arguments made by both parties and ultimately decided to keep the proceedings in abeyance so far as the applicants are concerned and stay the operation of the order dated 01.04.2005.

In a third case, a company was accused of discharging trade effluent into a stream, well, sewer, or land without obtaining consent from the State Board. The company was required to submit an application for consent and provide details regarding the construction, installation, and operation of the establishment or treatment and disposal system. The complainant Board refused consent due to incomplete application and lack of proper effluent treatment arrangements. The company continued to discharge effluent without obtaining consent, violating the provisions of the Act. The Board filed two separate complaints against the officers of the company for prosecution, and the petitioners were summoned for being in charge and responsible for the conduct of the company. The petitioners sought to quash the proceedings, but the court refused to do so, citing the wider scope of Section 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, compared to Section 17 of the Food Adulteration Act, 1954.

In another case, the court discussed the vicarious liability of directors and officers of a company under the Water Pollution Act. The court stated that the complaints cannot be quashed as the allegations made in them constitute an offense. The court also mentioned that the trial court should weigh the evidence at the time of framing the charge. The court further explained that the powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should not be invoked to check the abuse of the process of law when there is an effective alternative remedy to the applicant. The court concluded that it would not be expedient to weigh the evidence and proceed in the manner suggested by the petitioners at this stage.

The court also emphasized the principle of stare decisis and the importance of complying with previous court orders. The court further explained the doctrine of stare decisis and its application in the case. The court also cited previous cases and legal dictionaries to support its decision.

The court clarified that the burden of proof is on those in charge of the company to prove they did not have knowledge of the offense or took all due diligence to prevent it. The court also explained the definitions of terms such as "company," "director," "manager," and "officer." The court emphasized that the substance of the matter is more important than technicalities in criminal law cases.

The court also discussed the concept of vicarious liability and the burden of proof in criminal cases. It stated that a person can avoid vicarious liability if they can prove they had no knowledge of the crime or took all necessary steps to prevent it. The court also clarified that rules of evidence and deeming fictions do not need to be explicitly pleaded in a complaint or information report.

In one case, the court found that the non-appearance of the company's representative was not intentional and that the accused were not in charge of the company at the time of the offense. The court also found that the magistrate had made errors in rejecting the application for discharge and not complying with the court's previous direction. The court ordered that the application be reconsidered and that the complicity of each person be examined during the trial.

In another case, the court emphasized the importance of complying with earlier orders and directions, and quashed the previous orders. The court also clarified that the observations made in the judgment are only for the purpose of disposing of the petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. and that the trial court should exercise its discretion based on the record and proceed in accordance with the law.

In yet another case, the court quashed the orders for the warrants and for the adjournment application, but refused to quash the proceedings in the criminal case. The court directed the magistrate to proceed in accordance with the directions given by the court in 1987 and to decide on the liability of the applicants. The applicants were allowed to appear through counsel before the court.
