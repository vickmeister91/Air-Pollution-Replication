The court order pertains to two separate writ applications challenging the cancellation of Jamabandi (land records) in the name of the petitioners' ancestors. In the first case, the land in question was settled with the petitioners' grandfather by the ex-landlord in 1942, and the petitioners have been in continuous possession of the land since then. The cancellation was based on the land being recorded as forest land and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 being invoked. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

In the second case, there was a contradiction in the records regarding the opening of Jamabandi of a Gairmajurwa Malik land. The Additional Collector, Ranchi, after examining the matter, observed that the land in question is recorded as Junglejhari in the Revisional Survey Record of Rights and comes within the category of forest land under Section 20 of the Forest Protection Act, 1980. Therefore, the settlement of the land in favor of the petitioners' ancestor was rightly annulled. However, the court found that since the State Government had been accepting rent from the date of vesting of Jamindari from the settlee and that the settlement was made prior to 1st January 1946, the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to take steps for annulment of such settlement under the provisions of Section 4(h) of the Bihar Land Reforms Act. The court also found that the impugned order was bad on account of the fact that by reference to the Record of Rights, wherein the disputed land has been recorded as part of forest land, the concerned authorities of the respondents had sought to invoke the provisions of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 with retrospective effect which cannot be permissible. Therefore, the court allowed the application and set aside the impugned orders.

In both cases, the cancellation of the Jamabandi was based on the land being recorded as forest land and the Forest Conservation Act, 1980 being invoked. However, the court found that in the second case, the authorities had sought to invoke the provisions of the Act with retrospective effect, which was not permissible. The court also found that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to take steps for annulment of the settlement under the provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act, as the settlement was made prior to 1st January 1946 and the State Government had been accepting rent from the settlee.

The court's decision in both cases highlights the importance of accurate land records and the need for authorities to follow due process when invoking laws related to land use and conservation. The court's decision also underscores the need for clarity in the interpretation and application of laws related to land use and conservation, particularly in cases where there may be contradictions or ambiguities in the records.

Overall, the court's decision in these cases serves as a reminder of the importance of protecting the rights of landowners and ensuring that due process is followed in cases related to land use and conservation. It also highlights the need for authorities to exercise caution and clarity in the interpretation and application of laws related to land use and conservation, particularly in cases where there may be contradictions or ambiguities in the records.
