The Gujarat High Court recently heard an appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case involving violations of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court cited established principles that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality and the conclusion arrived at would not be arrived at by any reasonable person. The court found that the appellant had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and upheld the acquittal.

The court order states that the appellant has not provided any evidence to rebut the conclusion of the trial court, which found that the appellant had not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court finds no evidence to take a contrary view and agrees with the trial court's decision to acquit the respondents of the charges. The appeal is dismissed, and the record and proceedings are sent back to the trial court. Bail bonds, if any, are cancelled.

The appellant had appealed against this decision, arguing that the trial court had erred in its findings.

The Gujarat High Court, while hearing the appeal, noted that the approach of the lower court should not be interfered with unless there is some manifest illegality.
