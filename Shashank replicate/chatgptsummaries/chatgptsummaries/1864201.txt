The All India Skin and Hide Tanners & Merchants Association filed a writ petition to quash an award and report passed by The Loss of Ecology (Prevention and Payment of Compensation) Authority for Vellore district. The Authority was constituted by the Government of India to deal with the situation created by tanneries and other polluting industries in Tamil Nadu. The petitioner argued that the subsequent award passed in 2009 was without jurisdiction and that the polluters' liability was an absolute liability. 

The court rejected these arguments and held that the polluter's liability continues until the ecological damage caused by them is restored. The court also rejected the argument that the report and award were in violation of the principles of natural justice. The court order rejects the contention that the polluter is not liable for ecological damage caused by them until the damage is restored. The court finds that the polluter's liability is absolute and continues until the ecological damage caused by them is restored. 

The court also rejects the argument that the report and award violate natural justice by depriving the petitioner of their right to cross-examine the study team. The court finds that the petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine the study team and that the report and award were not in violation of the principles of natural justice. 

The court further finds no merit in the argument that the samples taken in 2009 cannot determine the condition of 1991-1998. The court upholds the report and award passed by the Loss of Ecology Authority and dismisses the writ petition. 

The court's decision is significant as it reinforces the principle of absolute liability for polluters. The court's decision also upholds the authority of the Loss of Ecology Authority to pass awards and reports to deal with the situation created by tanneries and other polluting industries in Tamil Nadu. 

The court's decision also highlights the importance of natural justice in administrative proceedings. The court finds that the petitioner had ample opportunity to cross-examine the study team and that the report and award were not in violation of the principles of natural justice. 

In conclusion, the court's decision in the All India Skin and Hide Tanners & Merchants Association case reinforces the principle of absolute liability for polluters and upholds the authority of the Loss of Ecology Authority to pass awards and reports to deal with the situation created by tanneries and other polluting industries in Tamil Nadu. The court's decision also highlights the importance of natural justice in administrative proceedings and finds that the report and award were not in violation of the principles of natural justice.
