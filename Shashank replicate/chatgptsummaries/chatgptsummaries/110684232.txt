The court order pertains to multiple cases related to mining activities of English India Clays Limited. The cases involve challenges to orders passed by the District Collector under the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, seeking police protection for mining and transportation of china clay, withdrawal of interdiction made to mining activities, and seeking interdiction of mining activities for lack of prior Environmental Clearance. The court also considered a writ petition filed by the Company seeking expeditious consideration of their application for Environmental Clearance. The judgment provides a summary of each case and the arguments presented by the parties.

In one case, the court discussed arguments made by various parties regarding a mining company that carried out mining activities without obtaining an Environmental Clearance (EC). The company had commenced mining activities in 2008 without an EC, and the court was considering whether to grant permission for the company to continue mining. The court heard arguments from the company, the state, and petitioners who argued that the mining activities had violated conditions of the lease and caused damage to the environment. The court ultimately ordered that the matter be considered by the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) within a specified time frame.

In another case, the court discussed a case involving a mining company that started construction on a road in a property leased for transporting clay mined, without obtaining an environmental clearance (EC) required by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). The court found that the company had to obtain an EC before mining activities could be carried out on the property. The court also noted that the company had engaged different lawyers in different cases and had suppressed information about pending litigation. The court ordered further consideration of the case in light of these findings.

The court also discussed a case where a mining company had commenced activities on leased land without obtaining an environmental clearance (EC) as mandated by a notification. The court found that the mining activity was illegal and attracted the rigour of a previous judgment. The court also noted that the company had ownership only over a portion of the leased land and had commenced operations on the basis of an approved mining plan, confining the mining activities to the extent belonging to the company. The court referred to various recommendations made by the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) and the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and found that the company had failed to comply with the conditions of the notification and to obtain a prior EC. The court also noted that the SEAC had specifically declined the recommendation on the ground of the lands covered in the orders lying contiguously to each other and the same requiring prior EC while the company had commenced mining operations even before obtaining a prior EC.

The court also discussed violations by a mining company in obtaining environmental clearances and obtaining consent from landowners. The government and its officers are criticized for their lackadaisical attitude towards enforcing environmental protection laws. The court also cites a study conducted by the state's own Directorate of Mining and Geology, which highlights the environmental degradation caused by the mining activities. The study recommends measures to mitigate dust emission and prevent the conversion of paddy lands. The court order raises serious concerns about the impact of mining on the environment and the socio-economic well-being of the local residents.

In another case, the court discussed a case involving illegal mining operations that caused environmental damage and had negative socio-economic impacts on the local population. Despite reports of violations and damage, the government allowed the company to continue its operations without obtaining prior environmental clearance. The court also criticizes the government for remaining silent and not taking action against the violations. The order also references previous litigation on the same issue and highlights the government's support for quarrying operations despite concerns about sustainability and public trust. The court ultimately condemns the government's inaction and lack of enforcement of environmental regulations.

The court order also discusses the illegality of short-term mining permits in Kerala and the requirement for environmental clearance for all mining projects, as mandated by the Supreme Court. The court rejects arguments that a circular issued by the Director can override this requirement and emphasizes the importance of sustainable development in light of recent natural disasters. The order also highlights the State's disregard for environmental concerns in allowing indiscriminate quarrying and mining.

The court order pertains to 42 connected cases related to flood and landslide caused by deforestation, encroachments, mining, and quarrying. The court notes that laws are in place to prevent such activities, but they are not effectively implemented. The court emphasizes the need for sustainable alternative methods and prevention of recurrence of such calamities. The court also finds that illegal mining was allowed by successive governments, causing environmental damage. The court dismisses a writ petition seeking police protection for mining operations and directs the company to proceed as directed by the learned Single Judge within three weeks. The court also sets aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge in another case and dismisses the writ.

In one case, the court states that a mining company is not allowed to carry out any mining activity in the area due to illegal extraction of China clay and overburden. The court directs the government to conduct an inspection of the site and recover 100% of the value of the illegally extracted materials. The company is also imposed with an exemplary cost of Rs. 10,00,000/- and is directed to pay Rs. 10,000/- each to the petitioners. Private parties were treated unfairly as they were
