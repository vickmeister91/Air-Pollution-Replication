The court order pertains to a criminal appeal against the acquittal of the accused in a case related to the breach of hazardous waste handling rules. The court explains the principles governing the hearing of appeals against orders of acquittal and reiterates that the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. 

The court notes that the trial court had acquitted the accused on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution had alleged that the accused had violated the hazardous waste handling rules by disposing of hazardous waste in an unauthorized manner. The prosecution had relied on the testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence to support its case.

The court observes that the trial court had carefully considered the evidence on record and had found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court notes that the trial court had pointed out several inconsistencies and contradictions in the prosecution's case and had found that the witnesses had given contradictory and unreliable testimony. The court also notes that the trial court had found that the documentary evidence relied upon by the prosecution was not sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused.

The court further observes that the trial court had correctly applied the principles of law governing the burden of proof in criminal cases. The court notes that in a criminal case, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The court notes that the trial court had correctly held that the prosecution had failed to discharge this burden and had therefore acquitted the accused.

The court finds that the trial court was justified in acquitting the accused and dismisses the appeal. The court reiterates that the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. The court notes that in the present case, there is no such illegality and therefore the appeal is dismissed.

In conclusion, the court order highlights the principles governing the hearing of appeals against orders of acquittal and emphasizes that the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal unless the approach of the lower court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. The court finds that the trial court was justified in acquitting the accused in the case related to the breach of hazardous waste handling rules and dismisses the appeal.
