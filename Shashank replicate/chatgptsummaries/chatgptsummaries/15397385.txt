The case in question involves a petition filed by the appellants under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, claiming that respondent No. 4 was using loudspeakers for broadcasting religious sermons in violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Rules made under it. The High Court dismissed the writ petition but directed respondent No. 4 to use the loudspeaker to an extent that the volume does not cause disturbance to the neighbors. The Supreme Court set aside the High Court's judgment and permitted the appellants to move the authority in the event of any grievance in regard to the breach of the Rules. The appeal was disposed of accordingly.

The use of loudspeakers for religious purposes has been a contentious issue in India for many years. While some argue that it is an essential part of religious practice, others contend that it causes noise pollution and disturbs the peace. In this case, the appellants argued that respondent No. 4 was using loudspeakers in violation of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Rules made under it.

The High Court dismissed the writ petition but directed respondent No. 4 to use the loudspeaker to an extent that the volume does not cause disturbance to the neighbors. This decision was based on the principle of balancing the right to freedom of religion with the right to a peaceful environment. However, the Supreme Court set aside this judgment and permitted the appellants to move the authority in the event of any grievance in regard to the breach of the Rules.

The Supreme Court's decision is significant because it clarifies the role of the judiciary in cases involving the use of loudspeakers for religious purposes. The court recognized that the use of loudspeakers is an important part of religious practice, but also acknowledged that it can cause disturbance to the neighbors. By allowing the appellants to move the authority in the event of any grievance, the court has provided a mechanism for resolving disputes without resorting to litigation.

Overall, this case highlights the importance of balancing competing interests in cases involving the use of loudspeakers for religious purposes. While the right to freedom of religion is an essential part of Indian society, it must be balanced against the right to a peaceful environment. The Supreme Court's decision in this case provides a framework for resolving disputes in a manner that respects both of these important rights.
