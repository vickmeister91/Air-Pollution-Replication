In a recent court order, a case between Mayank Sharma and Vishal Sharma was discussed. The respondent's counsel argued that the case should be heard by the same bench as a previous order found no illegality committed by the trial judge. The court directed the office to list the case before the appropriate bench and set a date for the hearing.

The case in question involves Mayank Sharma and Vishal Sharma, and it appears that there is some disagreement between the two parties. The respondent's counsel argued that the case should be heard by the same bench as a previous order found no illegality committed by the trial judge. This argument suggests that the respondent believes that the previous order is relevant to the current case and that the same bench should hear the case to ensure consistency.

The court, however, did not immediately agree with the respondent's counsel. Instead, the court directed the office to list the case before the appropriate bench. This suggests that the court believes that there may be a more appropriate bench to hear the case, and that the case should be heard by that bench instead.

The court also set a date for the hearing, indicating that the case will be heard in the near future. This is an important step in the legal process, as it ensures that the case will be heard and that both parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence.

Overall, this court order is significant because it highlights the importance of ensuring that cases are heard by the appropriate bench. By directing the office to list the case before the appropriate bench, the court is taking steps to ensure that the case is heard by the most qualified judges and that the outcome is fair and just.
