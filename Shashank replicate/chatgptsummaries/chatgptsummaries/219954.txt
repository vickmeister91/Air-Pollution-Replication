Geep Industrial Syndicate Ltd. received a notice from the Cess Officer to submit a return regarding the quantity of water consumed and pay cess to the Board. The petitioner argued that their industry is not covered under Schedule I of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The Cess Officer held that the petitioner's industry was covered under entries 1, 2 and 7 of Schedule I of the Act. The petitioner challenged the order, and the court held that the petitioner's industry is not covered by the Act and is not liable to pay any cess on the water consumed by it. The petitioner is entitled to a refund of the amount deposited under the interim order of the court.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was enacted to provide for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by industries and local authorities. The Act aims to prevent and control water pollution by regulating the discharge of pollutants into water bodies. The Act empowers the Central Government to notify the industries and local authorities that are required to pay the cess.

In the case of Geep Industrial Syndicate Ltd., the Cess Officer issued a notice to the petitioner to submit a return regarding the quantity of water consumed and pay cess to the Board. The petitioner argued that their industry is not covered under Schedule I of the Act and, therefore, is not liable to pay any cess on the water consumed by it.

The Cess Officer, however, held that the petitioner's industry was covered under entries 1, 2 and 7 of Schedule I of the Act. Entry 1 of Schedule I covers industries engaged in the production, processing, or manufacturing of goods specified in the First Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. Entry 2 covers industries engaged in the production, processing, or manufacturing of goods specified in the Second Schedule to the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951. Entry 7 covers industries engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power.

The petitioner challenged the order of the Cess Officer in the court. The court held that the petitioner's industry is not covered by the Act and is not liable to pay any cess on the water consumed by it. The court observed that the petitioner's industry is engaged in the manufacture of electrical goods, which are not covered under Schedule I of the Act. The court also noted that the petitioner's industry is not engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power, which is covered under entry 7 of Schedule I.

The court further held that the Cess Officer had erred in interpreting the provisions of the Act and had wrongly held that the petitioner's industry was covered under entries 1, 2 and 7 of Schedule I. The court observed that the Cess Officer had failed to consider the nature of the petitioner's industry and had applied the provisions of the Act mechanically.

The court, therefore, set aside the order of the Cess Officer and held that the petitioner's industry is not liable to pay any cess on the water consumed by it. The court also directed the Board to refund the amount deposited by the petitioner under the interim order of the court.

In conclusion, the case of Geep Industrial Syndicate Ltd. highlights the importance of correctly interpreting the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977. The court's decision in this case clarifies that industries engaged in the manufacture of goods that are not covered under Schedule I of the Act are not liable to pay any cess on the water consumed by them. The decision also emphasizes the need for the authorities to consider the nature of the industry before applying the provisions of the Act mechanically.
