The court orders in question relate to a dispute over the allocation of water between two parties. In the first case, the petitioner had filed a petition seeking to quash orders passed by Canal authorities under the Haryana Canal and Drainage Act, 1974. The petitioner irrigates his fields from the water course of Luhari minor village Luhari Ragho from the outlet No.RD32200-L for the last many years. Ram Parkash (respondent No.3) had objected to the petitioner's demand for water and filed an application for his own wari (turn) to be fixed at khata No.17 after the petitioner's wari (turn). The Deputy Collector accepted Ram Parkash's demand, and the petitioner filed an appeal which was dismissed. The petitioner contended that the principle of "first come first served" had been incorrectly applied, but the court found no merit in the petitioner's contentions.

In the second case, the petitioner had requested that their turn for water be continued jointly and not changed. The case was adjourned multiple times, and the petitioner was unable to prove that the principle of "first come first serve" and fixing the turn as per the location of the land was factually incorrect. The court dismissed the petition as there was no merit in it.

Water disputes are common in India, where water is a scarce resource and often the subject of legal battles. In this case, the dispute was over the allocation of water between two parties, with each party claiming a right to a certain amount of water. The petitioner in the first case had been using water from a particular outlet for many years, but Ram Parkash objected to the petitioner's demand for water and filed an application for his own turn to be fixed after the petitioner's turn. The Deputy Collector accepted Ram Parkash's demand, and the petitioner filed an appeal which was dismissed.

The petitioner in the first case contended that the principle of "first come first served" had been incorrectly applied, but the court found no merit in the petitioner's contentions. The court held that the Deputy Collector had correctly applied the principle of "first come first served" and that the petitioner had no right to demand water from a particular outlet. The court also held that the petitioner had failed to prove that Ram Parkash's demand for water was unreasonable or unjustified.

In the second case, the petitioner had requested that their turn for water be continued jointly and not changed. The court found that the petitioner had failed to prove that the principle of "first come first serve" and fixing the turn as per the location of the land was factually incorrect. The court held that the petitioner had no right to demand that their turn for water be continued jointly and that the allocation of water should be based on the principle of "first come first served" and the location of the land.

In both cases, the court held that the principle of "first come first served" was the correct principle to apply in the allocation of water. The court also held that the petitioners had failed to prove that the allocation of water was unreasonable or unjustified. The court dismissed both petitions as there was no merit in them.

In conclusion, the court orders in question relate to a dispute over the allocation of water between two parties. The court held that the principle of "first come first served" was the correct principle to apply in the allocation of water and that the petitioners had failed to prove that the allocation of water was unreasonable or unjustified. The court dismissed both petitions as there was no merit in them.
