The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a group of writ petitions filed by various mining companies challenging the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953. The petitioners argued that the provision, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest without granting a hearing to affected parties, violates several articles of the Constitution. The government, on the other hand, argued that the provision is necessary to protect forest land during the period when the government is conducting an inquiry into the nature and extent of rights of the state and private individuals over the land.

After hearing both sides, the court ultimately upheld the provision, stating that it is necessary to protect the environment and preserve forest cover. The court also discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court also emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The court's decision to uphold Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, is significant as it allows the government to protect forest land without granting a hearing to affected parties. This provision is crucial in cases where the government needs to act quickly to protect the environment and preserve forest cover. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court is a positive step towards preventing the devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court's suspension of mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology is also commendable as it shows the court's commitment to preserving the environment.

Overall, the court's order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and preserving forest cover. The court's emphasis on sustainable development and the precautionary principle is a positive development as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection. The court's decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court is also a positive step towards preventing the devastation of the environment and wildlife.
