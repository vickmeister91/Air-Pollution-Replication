The first court order pertains to a case where a trust owned two properties leased to a tenant who failed to pay rent. The trust filed a suit for eviction, which was decreed on the condition that the tenant pays the costs of the building or superstructure built by the tenant's predecessor-in-interest and purchased by the tenant. During the pendency of the second appeal, the tenant filed an application under Section 9 of the Tamil Nadu Tenants' Protection Act, 1921, seeking a direction to the landlord to sell the land adjoining the building for the beneficial enjoyment of the superstructure. The application was rejected, but the Subordinate Judge allowed the tenant's appeal. The High Court held that the tenant was entitled to make an application under Section 9 during the pendency of the execution proceedings, and the right of the tenant had not been affected by the deposit of the compensation amount. The court dismissed the appeal by the managing trustee of the trust.

The second court order dismissed an appeal and did not accept the argument that the respondent lost possession and therefore lost their rights under Section 9. The court also declined to consider this argument as it was not previously pleaded or considered in lower courts. The respondent's application under Section 9 will be decided on its merits and compensation will be determined according to the law. No costs were ordered.
