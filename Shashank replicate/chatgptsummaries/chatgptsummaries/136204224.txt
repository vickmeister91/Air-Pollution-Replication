The court order pertains to a criminal case where the petitioner is accused of committing an offense under Section 304(B) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner had secured anticipatory bail with certain conditions, but the Investigating Officer issued a notice under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directing the petitioner to deposit his passport before the court below. The petitioner challenged this notice, arguing that the jurisdictional facts required for the jurisdictional power under Section 91 were non-existent.

The court held that while the petitioner had complied with the conditions of the bail order, the Investigating Officer had the right to demand the surrender of the passport. The court ordered the petitioner to surrender the passport before the court below, which would keep it in safe custody without making any endorsement regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the case. The petitioner could make an appropriate application seeking permission to travel abroad, and the court below would take a decision based on the facts and circumstances of the case.
