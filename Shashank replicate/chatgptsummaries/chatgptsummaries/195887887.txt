The Custom, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai recently heard an appeal by Pennar Industries Ltd against the Commissioner of GST & Central Excise. After hearing submissions from both sides, the tribunal referred to a previous final order and decided to set aside the impugned order in this appeal and allow it with consequential relief, if any, as per law. The final order was dictated and pronounced in court by Hon'ble Ms. Sulekha Beevi, C.S., Member (Judicial) on July 19, 2019.

The case involved Pennar Industries Ltd, a company engaged in the manufacture and sale of steel products, and the Commissioner of GST & Central Excise. The dispute arose over the classification of certain goods manufactured by Pennar Industries Ltd and the applicable rate of excise duty.

Pennar Industries Ltd contended that the goods in question were classifiable under Chapter Heading 7308 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, which pertains to "Structures (excluding prefabricated buildings of heading 9406) and parts of structures (for example, bridges and bridge-sections, lock-gates, towers, lattice masts, roofs, roofing frameworks, doors and windows and their frames and thresholds for doors, shutters, balustrades, pillars and columns), of iron or steel; plates, rods, angles, shapes, sections, tubes and the like, prepared for use in structures, of iron or steel."

The Commissioner of GST & Central Excise, on the other hand, contended that the goods were classifiable under Chapter Heading 7210 of the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, which pertains to "Flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloy steel, of a width of 600 mm or more, hot-rolled, not clad, plated or coated."

The tribunal noted that the issue of classification had been considered in a previous final order in the case of Pennar Industries Ltd v. Commissioner of Central Excise, Hyderabad-II, wherein it was held that the goods in question were classifiable under Chapter Heading 7308. The tribunal observed that the present case was identical to the previous case and that the impugned order was contrary to the previous final order.

Accordingly, the tribunal set aside the impugned order and allowed the appeal with consequential relief, if any, as per law. The final order was dictated and pronounced in court by Hon'ble Ms. Sulekha Beevi, C.S., Member (Judicial) on July 19, 2019.

This decision by the Custom, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai is significant as it reaffirms the principle of consistency in the application of the law. It also highlights the importance of previous final orders in determining the outcome of similar cases. The decision is likely to have a positive impact on businesses that are involved in disputes over the classification of goods and the applicable rate of excise duty.
