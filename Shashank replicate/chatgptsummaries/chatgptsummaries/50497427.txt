The case involves a complaint filed under Section 43(b) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act,1981 against the accused for establishing and operating Line III without obtaining prior consent from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The court quashed all proceedings against all accused except accused Nos.1,5 and 6. The learned Magistrate issued an order to proceed against the revision petitioners, but the court found that the Magistrate failed to consider certain relevant and material documents.

The company provides an undertaking and the Pollution Control Board issues an order keeping the closure in abeyance for four months. The court finds that the learned Magistrate failed to consider the documents provided by the Pollution Control Board and remits the matter back to the trial court for fresh consideration of the entire matter and to pass fresh orders after referring to all the documents. The trial court is directed to expedite the proceedings and to pass orders as expeditiously as possible.
