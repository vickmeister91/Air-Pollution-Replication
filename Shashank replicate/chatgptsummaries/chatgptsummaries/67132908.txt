The National Insurance Company Ltd. appealed a judgment by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal that awarded compensation to the legal heirs of deceased Rohan Tyagi and Anuj Kumar, who died in a motor vehicle accident, and to Kuldeep Singh who suffered injuries in the same accident. The only ground of challenge raised in the Appeals was that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the offending car and that the accident was caused by 'vis major'. However, the Claims Tribunal found that the accident was caused by the rash and negligent driving of the car and that there was no rebuttal to the evidence led by the Claimants. The court also stated that even if the accident occurs due to a tyre burst or ill maintenance of the vehicle, the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company cannot escape liability.

The court order discusses the legal principle of "strict liability" in the case of an accident caused by a car being driven in a negligent manner. The court cites the "Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher" which holds that if someone keeps something likely to cause harm and it escapes, they are responsible for any resulting damage. The court notes that there are some defenses against this rule, such as the act of God or the plaintiff's own fault. The court ultimately finds the defendant liable for the accident and dismisses the appeals.

The case at hand involves a motor vehicle accident that resulted in the death of two individuals and injuries to another. The National Insurance Company Ltd. appealed the judgment of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, which awarded compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased and the injured party. The only ground of challenge raised in the Appeals was that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the offending car and that the accident was caused by 'vis major'. However, the Claims Tribunal found that the accident was caused by the rash and negligent driving of the car and that there was no rebuttal to the evidence led by the Claimants. The court also stated that even if the accident occurs due to a tyre burst or ill maintenance of the vehicle, the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company cannot escape liability.

The court order delves into the legal principle of "strict liability" in the case of an accident caused by a car being driven in a negligent manner. The court cites the "Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher" which holds that if someone keeps something likely to cause harm and it escapes, they are responsible for any resulting damage. The court notes that there are some defenses against this rule, such as the act of God or the plaintiff's own fault. However, in this case, the court finds that the defendant cannot escape liability as there was evidence of rash and negligent driving.

The court order emphasizes that the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company cannot escape liability even if the accident occurs due to a tyre burst or ill maintenance of the vehicle. This is because the owner of the vehicle has a duty to ensure that the vehicle is maintained properly and is safe to be driven on the road. The insurance company, on the other hand, has a duty to compensate the victims of the accident as per the terms of the insurance policy.

The court also dismisses the appeals made by the National Insurance Company Ltd. The court finds that the Claims Tribunal had correctly awarded compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased and the injured party. The court notes that the only ground of challenge raised in the Appeals was that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the offending car and that the accident was caused by 'vis major'. However, the Claims Tribunal had found evidence of rash and negligent driving, which the defendant had failed to rebut.

In conclusion, the court order discusses the legal principle of "strict liability" in the case of an accident caused by a car being driven in a negligent manner. The court cites the "Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher" which holds that if someone keeps something likely to cause harm and it escapes, they are responsible for any resulting damage. The court notes that there are some defenses against this rule, such as the act of God or the plaintiff's own fault.

The court also emphasizes that the owner of the vehicle and the insurance company cannot escape liability even if the accident occurs due to a tyre burst or ill maintenance of the vehicle. The court ultimately dismisses the appeals made by the National Insurance Company Ltd. and upholds the judgment of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal.
