The court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by C.R. Mammen against P. Kannan. Mammen had challenged an order passed by the court below, which had directed him to furnish certain documents based on a petition filed by Kannan under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). Mammen's counsel had argued that he was not in possession of all the documents and was willing to produce only those that were available with him.

The court, after hearing both sides, found no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the court below. The court noted that Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to any person to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Cr.P.C. The court further observed that the power conferred under Section 91 is very wide and is intended to enable the court to elicit the truth and to do justice in a fair and proper manner.

The court also noted that Mammen had not challenged the validity of the petition filed by Kannan under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court held that once a petition is filed under Section 91, the court has the power to issue a summons or order to produce the documents or things mentioned in the petition. The court further held that it was not necessary for the person against whom the petition is filed to be in possession of all the documents or things mentioned in the petition. The person is only required to produce the documents or things that are in his possession or control.

The court, therefore, disposed of Mammen's petition with a direction to complete the proceedings within three months. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in enabling courts to elicit the truth and to do justice in a fair and proper manner. It also highlights the fact that the power conferred under Section 91 is very wide and is intended to be used in the interests of justice.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal original petition filed by C.R. Mammen against P. Kannan. Mammen had challenged an order passed by the court below, which had directed him to furnish certain documents based on a petition filed by Kannan under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The court, after hearing both sides, found no illegality or infirmity in the order passed by the court below and disposed of the petition with a direction to complete the proceedings within three months. The court's decision reaffirms the importance of Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. in enabling courts to elicit the truth and to do justice in a fair and proper manner.
