The court disposed of the writ petition, giving liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh petition seeking amendment of the plaint.

The case at hand involved a petition filed by plaintiffs in a suit pending before the Civil Judge (Sr. Division), Jajpur, seeking to amend the plaint. The petition was rejected on the grounds that no amendment should be allowed after the commencement of the hearing of a suit. The plaintiffs then filed a writ petition before the High Court challenging the order of the Civil Judge.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the amended provision under Order 6, Rule 17 C.P.C. shall not be applicable to suits filed earlier than the year 2002, as per the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002. The court noted that the amendment to Order 6, Rule 17 C.P.C. was introduced in the year 2002, and therefore, it cannot be applied retrospectively to suits filed before that year.

The court also observed that the amendment to Order 6, Rule 17 C.P.C. was introduced to enable the courts to grant leave to amend pleadings at any stage of the proceedings, and that the purpose of the amendment was to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and to ensure that the real controversy between the parties is determined in a single suit. However, the court held that this amendment cannot be applied to suits filed before the year 2002, as it would be contrary to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002.

The court, therefore, disposed of the writ petition, giving liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh petition seeking amendment of the plaint. The court also clarified that the order passed by the Civil Judge rejecting the petition for amendment of the plaint was not erroneous, as it was in accordance with the law prevailing at the time of filing of the suit.

In conclusion, the court order in question clarifies that the amended provision under Order 6, Rule 17 C.P.C. shall not be applicable to suits filed earlier than the year 2002, as per the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002. The court also emphasizes that the purpose of the amendment was to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and to ensure that the real controversy between the parties is determined in a single suit. However, the court held that this amendment cannot be applied retrospectively to suits filed before the year 2002, as it would be contrary to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002. The court, therefore, disposed of the writ petition, giving liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh petition seeking amendment of the plaint.
