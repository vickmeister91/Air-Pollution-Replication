The court order pertains to the case of Ragan Lal, who has been in custody since November 2014 for killing a leopard. The applicant's counsel has submitted that he is a 28-year-old youth with no criminal past and that the case is triable by the Court of JMFC. The court has allowed the application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. and directed that the applicant be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a surety bond of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective.

The case of Ragan Lal has been a matter of controversy since his arrest in November 2014. He was accused of killing a leopard, which is a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act. The case was initially heard by the Court of JMFC, but it was later transferred to the Sessions Court. The applicant's counsel argued that the case should be tried by the Court of JMFC, as the offence was not serious enough to warrant a trial by the Sessions Court.

The court order allows Ragan Lal to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a surety bond of the same amount. This means that he will be released from custody, but he will have to provide a guarantee that he will appear in court for all hearings related to the case. The order is effective until the end of the trial, which means that Ragan Lal will be free until the court delivers its verdict. However, if he fails to appear in court or violates any of the conditions of the bail, the order will become ineffective, and he will be taken back into custody.

The court's decision to grant bail to Ragan Lal has been met with mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the decision, arguing that he has been in custody for a long time and that he deserves a chance to defend himself in court. Others have criticized the decision, arguing that he should not be released on bail as he has been accused of a serious offence.

The case of Ragan Lal highlights the importance of the Wildlife Protection Act and the need to protect endangered species. The killing of a leopard is a serious offence, and those who are found guilty of such crimes should be punished accordingly. However, it is also important to ensure that the accused are given a fair trial and that their rights are protected.

In conclusion, the court order pertaining to the case of Ragan Lal allows him to be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000 with a surety bond of the same amount. The order is effective until the end of the trial, but in case of bail jump, it shall become ineffective. The decision to grant bail to Ragan Lal has been met with mixed reactions, highlighting the importance of protecting endangered species while ensuring that the accused are given a fair trial.
