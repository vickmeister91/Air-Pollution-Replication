The recent court order pertains to two petitions that were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitions sought to quash awards that were passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat. However, the court dismissed the petitions, stating that the Lok Adalat's awards cannot be challenged under Article 226. The court further advised the parties to settle their disputes in a forum of competent jurisdiction.

The Lok Adalat is a forum for alternative dispute resolution that was established in India in 1987. It is a non-adversarial system that aims to resolve disputes through conciliation and compromise. The Lok Adalat is empowered to settle disputes in civil, criminal, and revenue matters. Its awards are binding on the parties and have the same status as a decree of a civil court.

In the present case, the parties had approached the Lok Adalat to settle their dispute. The Lok Adalat had passed awards in favor of one of the parties. However, the other party was dissatisfied with the awards and had filed petitions under Article 226 to challenge them.

Article 226 of the Constitution of India empowers the High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for any other purpose. The writs that can be issued under Article 226 include habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari. The purpose of Article 226 is to ensure that the citizens of India have access to justice and that their fundamental rights are protected.

However, the court in the present case held that the Lok Adalat's awards cannot be challenged under Article 226. The court observed that the Lok Adalat is a forum for alternative dispute resolution and that its awards are final and binding on the parties. The court further stated that the parties should settle their disputes in a forum of competent jurisdiction.

The court also granted protection to the petitioner under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. Section 14 of the Limitation Act provides for the exclusion of the period spent pursuing a remedy from the period of limitation. In the present case, the petitioner had filed petitions under Article 226 to challenge the Lok Adalat's awards. The court granted protection to the petitioner under Section 14, which means that the period spent pursuing this remedy will be excluded from the period of limitation.

In conclusion, the recent court order pertains to two petitions that were filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court dismissed the petitions, stating that the Lok Adalat's awards cannot be challenged under Article 226 and that the parties should settle their disputes in a forum of competent jurisdiction. The court also granted protection to the petitioner under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. The order highlights the importance of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms like the Lok Adalat and emphasizes the need for parties to settle their disputes amicably.
