The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases involving bribery and corruption. In the first order, the appellant was convicted of committing an offense under the Prevention of Corruption Act and sentenced to one year of simple imprisonment with a fine. The prosecution's case was that the accused demanded an illegal gratification of Rs 2000/- and accepted the bribe on 22nd December 1995. The appellant challenged the order on various grounds, including the lack of evidence regarding the acceptance of the amount. The court ordered a thorough scrutiny of the evidence to verify if there was proper appreciation of evidence while convicting the appellant.

In the second order, the court discusses the evidence presented by the prosecution in a case where the accused is accused of accepting bribes. The prosecution presented six witnesses and documentary evidence, but the court found discrepancies in the evidence and contradictions between witnesses. The court notes that there is no reliable evidence beyond reasonable doubt to prove that the accused committed the offense, and therefore the accused is acquitted.

The third court order describes the testimony of several witnesses in a case involving bribery and corruption. One witness contradicts the prosecution's claim that tainted currency notes were found on the accused's desk, while another witness admits to giving a sign to the raiding party before the raid began. The complainant also admits to receiving letters from the accused prior to the alleged bribery incident, but claims that he demanded money in exchange for returning two of them. There are several contradictions in the complainant's testimony and evidence presented in the case.

The fourth court order discusses contradictions and irregularities in the deposition of the complainant in a bribery case. The complainant admitted to misplacing original letters and changing the names of companies, and there were discrepancies in her statements. The court also found that a witness supported the defense version and negated the prosecution's case. As a result, the court extended the benefit of doubt to the accused and found the evidence on record to be unreliable.

In the fifth court order, the evidence presented against the appellant is deemed unreliable and contradictory. The witnesses are chance witnesses and their testimonies do not confirm the commission of the offense. The documentary evidence produced by the prosecution is also insufficient. The court notes that the prosecution failed to produce documents and that the non-production of documents goes against the prosecution case and in favor of the appellant. The court also mentions that the complainant's deposition was recorded almost a year before the prosecution claimed that the appellant was threatening her, which makes the claim baseless. The court concludes that there is no reason to confirm the conviction of the appellant.

Finally, the court order dismisses an application made by the complainant, who had already been examined and did not make a grievance about a threat administered by the accused. The order cites three cases that establish that for conviction, all three actions of prior demand, demand at the time of trap, and acceptance of the amount must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. The trial court failed to rely on contradictions and convicted the accused in absence of cogent and reliable evidence. The order quashes and sets aside the impugned judgment, cancels the bail bond of the appellant, and sends the record and proceedings back to the trial court.

In summary, these court orders highlight the importance of reliable evidence and proper appreciation of evidence in cases involving bribery and corruption. The court scrutinizes the evidence presented by the prosecution and looks for discrepancies and contradictions to determine the reliability of the evidence. The court also emphasizes the need for all three actions of prior demand, demand at the time of trap, and acceptance of the amount to be proved beyond reasonable doubt for conviction. The orders demonstrate the court's commitment to ensuring justice is served and that the accused is not wrongfully convicted.
