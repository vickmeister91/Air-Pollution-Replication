The Patna High Court recently issued several court orders related to disputes between Pawan Kumar Purbey and various government officials and councilors of the Nagar Parishad in Madhubani, Bihar. The court orders pertain to two cases, LPA No. 1564 of 2009 and LPA No. 1579 of 2009, and three writ petitions, namely, CWJC No.7646 of 2009, CWJC No.7567 of 2009 and CWJC No.8075 of 2009.

The first court order lists the names and addresses of all the parties involved in the two cases and the lawyers representing them. The disputes between Pawan Kumar Purbey and the government officials and councilors of the Nagar Parishad in Madhubani, Bihar, are the subject of these cases.

The second court order pertains to a batch of appeals against a common order passed by a learned Single Judge. The appeals are against the order passed by the learned Single Judge, whereby he directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a special meeting with regard to no confidence motion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance with the requisition as received and seek confidence of the House within the period as provided under the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007. The order also discusses the factual exposition in all the cases and the commonality between them.

The third court order discusses several writ petitions challenging the circular issued by the State Government regarding the procedure for holding a meeting of no confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor. The court held that the circular was contrary to the provisions of the Act and could not be accepted to remain in force. The court also noted that the District Magistrate could not have been conferred the power by executive instruction in the absence of a rule. The court directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a special meeting with the agenda regarding the no confidence motion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance with the requisition received. The court also discussed Section 25 of the Act, which deals with the removal of the Chief Councillor/Deputy Chief Councillor.

The fourth court order discusses the procedure for holding a special meeting of councillors and the role of the Chief Councillor in presiding over such meetings. It also addresses the issue of rules being necessary for the enforcement of certain provisions of the Act, citing previous court decisions. The court concludes that the Chief Councillor or the Deputy Councillor should preside over the meeting and that the circular issued by the Under Secretary is in violation of statutory provisions. The court also rejects the argument that rules are necessary for holding a meeting to consider a motion of no confidence.

The fifth court order discusses various sections of the Companies Act and the importance of compliance with accounting standards and presenting true and fair accounts. The court also cites other cases to establish the principle that if the provisions of an act can be given effect to, non-framing of rules would not vitiate the act. The court concludes that a vote of no confidence can be carried out without framing of rules and that the provisions of the statute are workable. The court also addresses the issue of convening another meeting for a vote of no confidence and notes that the Madhubani Nagar Parishad consists of 30 elected members.

The sixth and final court order discusses a meeting held by the Madhubani Nagar Parishad in 2009, which was convened to consider a vote of no confidence. The meeting was held without proper notice to all members, and the court deemed it to be invalid. The court rectified the error by issuing a direction to ensure that all members were properly notified for the next meeting. The appeals made against this decision were dismissed.

In summary, the Patna High Court issued several court orders related to disputes between Pawan Kumar Purbey and various government officials and councilors of the Nagar Parishad in Madhubani, Bihar. The court orders pertain to two cases and three writ petitions and address issues related to the procedure for holding a meeting of no confidence motion against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor, the role of the Chief Councillor in presiding over special meetings of councillors, compliance with accounting standards and presenting true and fair accounts, and the validity of a meeting held without proper notice to all members. The court orders provide guidance on the interpretation and application of the Bihar Municipal Act, 2007, and establish important principles related to the enforcement of statutory provisions.
