The Delhi High Court recently heard 14 writ petitions filed by manufacturing units in Delhi that were directed to close down their operations by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The DPCC had categorized these units under the 'H' category as per Master Plan 2001 and following the orders of the Supreme Court passed in I.A. 22/94 in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 4677 of 1985 entitled M.C. Mehta v. Union of India and Ors. The petitioners argued that they were manufacturing Urea Formaldehyde Powder, which is not hazardous, and that the DPCC was confusing it with the manufacturing of formaldehyde, which is hazardous. The court heard arguments on the validity of the closure order dated 7th June 2000, which the petitioners claimed was arbitrary, mala fide, and a violation of natural justice and fundamental rights.

The court order discusses the categorization of Urea Formaldehyde Powder manufacturing units as either 'F' or 'H' category, with the latter being prohibited from operating within the Union Territory of Delhi since 1994. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had classified the petitioner's unit as 'H' based on the hazardous nature of the manufacturing process and the potential harm to the environment and workers. The petitioner challenged this categorization and argued that their unit should be classified as 'F'. The court considered several questions, including whether the writ petition was maintainable in light of the alternate remedy of appeal, whether the impugned order was violative of principles of natural justice, and whether the categorization of UF Moulding Powder manufacturing units as 'H' was proper and valid. Ultimately, the court decided to hear the case on its merits rather than relegating the petitioner to the remedy of appeal, but clarified that this was not a general rule and that the remedy of appeal should normally be exhausted before approaching the court.

The court order discusses several points raised by the petitioners, including the categorization of their industry as 'H' and the violation of natural justice in the closure order. The court rejects the argument that the petitioners can only seek remedy from the Supreme Court and not file a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution. The court also finds that the closure order was not made without giving the petitioners an opportunity to represent their case and that it is not violative of Article 19 of the Constitution. The court further rejects the argument that the closure order is a non-speaking order and finds that there was sufficient material available to support the reasoning and conclusions of the respondents. The court also discusses the objectives of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the importance of controlling air pollution.

In another case, the court order discusses the implementation of decisions made at a conference regarding the preservation of air quality and control of air pollution. The Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution will also perform the functions of the Central Board for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and State Boards for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution in Union Territories. State Boards will also perform functions for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The court also discusses the power of the respondents to declare industrial units as causing air pollution and to issue directions to close them down. The court emphasizes that judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the manner in which the decision was made. 

In yet another case, the court order discusses a petitioner industry arguing that it should be categorized under 'F' category instead of 'H' category for air pollution control. The court states that it does not have the expertise to determine the veracity of the claims made by either party and that the decision of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) should be respected. The court cites a previous case where the evaluation of scientific data was left to expert bodies and not the court. The court emphasizes the importance of environmental concerns and dismisses the petitions with costs.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of controlling air pollution and the role of the DPCC and CPCB in categorizing industries based on their potential harm to the environment and workers. The court also emphasizes the importance of following due process and natural justice in issuing closure orders and the need for judicial review to ensure that decisions are made in a fair and transparent manner. While the court acknowledges the importance of environmental concerns, it also recognizes the need to balance these concerns with the rights of industries to operate and provide employment opportunities.
