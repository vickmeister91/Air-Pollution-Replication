The case involves M/s Bhat Shawl Industries, accused of exporting shawls containing Shahtoosh hairs, which are protected under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972.

The defense argued that no prima facie case had been made against the accused, but the court found that there was sufficient evidence to frame charges.

The case is put up for framing of charge/post-charge evidence on a later date, and witnesses are summoned for cross-examination.
