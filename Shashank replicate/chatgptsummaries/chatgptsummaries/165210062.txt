Ishwar Singh was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. He filed a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The court has granted him bail and directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each.

The Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act are two important laws in India that deal with the protection of wildlife and the regulation of arms. The Wild Life Protection Act was enacted in 1972 to provide for the protection of wild animals and birds and to regulate their hunting. The Arms Act was enacted in 1959 to regulate the possession, manufacture, sale, and transport of arms and ammunition.

Ishwar Singh's arrest under these two Acts suggests that he may have been involved in illegal hunting or possession of arms. However, the court has granted him bail, which means that he will be released from custody until the completion of the trial. The bail amount of Rs.50,000/- and the sureties of Rs.25,000/- each are meant to ensure that Ishwar Singh appears before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so.

Bail is a legal provision that allows a person who has been arrested to be released from custody until the completion of the trial. Bail is granted on the condition that the person appears before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the person does not abscond or tamper with the evidence.

In Ishwar Singh's case, the court has granted him bail, which means that he will be released from custody. However, he will have to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so. If he fails to do so, the bail may be cancelled, and he may be arrested again.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Ishwar Singh, who was arrested for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act. The bail application was filed under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The court has directed Ishwar Singh to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each for his appearance before the trial court on every date of hearing and whenever called upon to do so till the completion of the trial. This decision highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act and Arms Act in India and the legal provision of bail.
