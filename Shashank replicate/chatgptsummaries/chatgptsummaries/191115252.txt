The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed by S. Prasad against Chandrashekharaiah R. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order dated 9.3.215 on an application filed under section 91 & 311 of the Cr.P.C. in C.C.No.186/2012 on the file of the Civil Judge and Addl. JMFC, Bhadravathi.

The petitioner's case was that he had been falsely implicated in a criminal case and that the prosecution had relied on certain documents that were not admissible in evidence. He had therefore filed an application under sections 91 and 311 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to summon certain witnesses and to produce certain documents in order to prove his innocence.

The trial court had dismissed the petitioner's application on the ground that the documents sought to be produced were not relevant to the case and that the witnesses sought to be summoned were not material witnesses. The petitioner had then filed the present petition seeking to set aside the trial court's order.

However, at the hearing of the petition, the petitioner's advocate filed a memo stating that the petition may be dismissed as not pressed. The court accordingly dismissed the petition.

The order is significant in that it highlights the importance of proper legal representation. The petitioner in this case had initially filed a petition seeking relief from the trial court's order, but had apparently not been able to make out a strong case in support of his petition. His advocate, upon realizing this, filed a memo stating that the petition may be dismissed as not pressed, thereby saving the petitioner from the possibility of an adverse order.

The order also underscores the importance of following proper legal procedures. The trial court had dismissed the petitioner's application on the ground that the documents sought to be produced were not relevant to the case and that the witnesses sought to be summoned were not material witnesses. The petitioner had then filed the present petition seeking to set aside the trial court's order. However, the court dismissed the petition as not pressed, indicating that the petitioner had not followed the proper legal procedures in seeking relief from the trial court's order.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by S. Prasad against Chandrashekharaiah R. The petitioner had sought to set aside an order dated 9.3.215 on an application filed under section 91 & 311 of the Cr.P.C. in C.C.No.186/2012 on the file of the Civil Judge and Addl. JMFC, Bhadravathi. However, the petitioner's advocate filed a memo stating that the petition may be dismissed as not pressed, and the court dismissed the petition accordingly. The order highlights the importance of proper legal representation and following proper legal procedures.
