In the first court order, the case discussed is one where the parents of a boy who died from electrocution sued the Kerala State Electricity Board for compensation. The court found that the boy's death was due to the negligence of the electricity board and awarded compensation to the parents. The court also discussed the issue of strict liability in cases of electrocution and the importance of proper safety measures around power lines.

The court found that there was no evidence to support the electricity board's claim that the boy climbed the tower and that the board was responsible for the accident due to lack of proper earthing and fencing around the tower. The court also referred to Indian Electricity Rules and the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.

The court's decision was based on the principle of strict liability, which means that the defendant is responsible for any damage caused by ultra-hazardous business or activities, regardless of whether they were negligent or not. The court calculated the amount of damages to be paid based on the victim's income and other relevant factors. The total amount of damages to be paid was determined to be Rs. 1,69,600.
