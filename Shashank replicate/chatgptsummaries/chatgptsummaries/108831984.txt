The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Ramanuj Gour seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate in a criminal complaint filed against him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The petitioner had issued a cheque of Rs. 5 lakhs to the complainant, which bounced due to insufficient funds.

During the course of the trial, the complainant had stated during cross-examination that the money given to him by his mother and wife was used to give the petitioner the amount in question. The petitioner filed an application to defer cross-examination and call for the income tax returns of the complainant's mother and wife. The court dismissed the application, stating that a fishing and roving inquiry cannot be held in such cases and that the petitioner can call an income tax official as a defense witness.

The petitioner then filed a petition seeking the quashing of the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate. The petitioner argued that the order was passed without considering the evidence on record and that the court had erred in dismissing his application to call for the income tax returns of the complainant's mother and wife.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, dismissed the petition. The court held that the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate was not erroneous and that the petitioner had failed to make out a case for quashing the order. The court also held that the petitioner's application to call for the income tax returns of the complainant's mother and wife was rightly dismissed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate.

The court observed that a fishing and roving inquiry cannot be held in such cases and that the petitioner can call an income tax official as a defense witness. The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference with the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate.

The court further held that the petitioner's liberty to examine an income tax official as a defense witness was not curtailed by the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate. The court observed that the petitioner was free to examine any witness in his defense and that the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate did not prevent him from doing so.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a petition filed by Ramanuj Gour seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate in a criminal complaint filed against him under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court dismissed the petition and held that the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate was not erroneous. The court also held that the petitioner's liberty to examine an income tax official as a defense witness was not curtailed by the order passed by the Special Metropolitan Magistrate.
