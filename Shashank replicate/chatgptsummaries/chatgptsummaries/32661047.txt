A recent court order pertains to a bail application filed by three accused persons in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution alleged that the accused had caught an endangered Indian Pangolin and brought it to Kerala for illegal sale. The court considered the submissions of both the prosecution and the defense and granted bail to the accused, subject to certain conditions.

The court held that the principles guiding the grant of bail are the probability of the accused appearing for trial and not their guilt or innocence. The accused were required to execute a bond and provide sureties, produce identification proof, appear before the investigating officer, not intimidate witnesses or tamper with evidence, not commit any offense while on bail, not leave Kerala without permission, and surrender their passport. The court warned that any violation of these conditions would result in cancellation of bail.
