The Karnataka High Court recently received a public interest litigation against respondent No.7 for causing nuisance by running heavy machinery for spinning silk thread even after the order dated 02.08.2014 of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was causing air and noise pollution, which was affecting the health of the residents in the area. The court directed the authorities to take action against respondent No.7, but none of them took any necessary actions.

The petitioner further alleged that the Pollution Control Board failed to enforce its own order or file a criminal complaint against the respondent. The court observed that the Pollution Control Board had the power to take action against the respondent under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, and the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the Board failed to take any action against the respondent, which was a clear violation of its statutory duties.

The court also noted that the respondent had been running the industry and workshop without obtaining the necessary licenses and permits. The court directed the authorities to take immediate action against the respondent and close down the industry and workshop. The court also canceled the license of the respondent.

The Supreme Court also noted that the respondent had been causing air and noise pollution, which was affecting the health of the residents in the area.
