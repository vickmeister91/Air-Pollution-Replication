The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sri G. Ramanarayana Joshi against the State of Karnataka. The petitioner had inherited land that was forfeited by the state government due to non-payment of land revenue. The land was later transferred to the Forest Department for creating a land bank. The petitioner had submitted applications for restoration of the land, which were rejected by the Deputy Commissioner. However, the High Court allowed the writ petition and directed the government to cancel the order transferring the land to the Forest Department. The court found that the petitioner had satisfied the criteria for restoration of the land and had continuous possession of the property.

The court order directs the State Government to consider the recommendations made by the Deputy Commissioner and pass orders expeditiously. The petitioner is entitled to seek restoration of the forfeited land if they continued to be in possession of it. The State Government failed to act on the Deputy Commissioner's request to cancel the order transferring the land to the Forest Department. The Forest Department's claim that the land has become forest land and is governed by the provisions of the Forest Act is impermissible. The court quashes the eviction notice and the order passed by the Additional Chief Conservator of Forests.

The court order states that a piece of land cannot be treated as reserved forest and the Forest Department has no right over it. The petitioner was found to be in possession of the land and had grown coffee and arecanut on it. The Forest Department's notice of eviction is illegal and without authority of law. The State Government has ignored the court's directions and needs to restore the land to the petitioner within 30 days. The court has the power to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the government or public authority to exercise its discretion properly and lawfully.
