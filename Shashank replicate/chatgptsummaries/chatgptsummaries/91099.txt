The Gauhati High Court recently heard an appeal by Khaizallan and Anr. against Thockchom Jitenkumar Singh and others. The case concerned the admissible pay scale for the post of Law Officer in the Manipur Pollution Control Board. The pre-revised pay scale was revised by the Manipur Services (Revised Pay Rules) of 1999, and the Board adopted these rules. However, confusion arose regarding the actual admissibility of the revised pay scale, with three different scales being proposed. The writ petition was filed to vindicate personal vendetta against the appellant, who was the sole respondent in his personal capacity. The Board was made a proforma respondent, but no grievance was raised against it, nor was any prayer made for any direction to the Board. The writ petition was not maintainable, but the court decided to hear the case on merit.

The court order states that the ultimate authority for approving a particular pay scale for an officer of the Board lies with the State Government, as they provide grants-in-aid and budgetary allocation for payment of salaries. The order also mentions various provisions of the Act and Rules related to budgetary sanction and maintaining proper accounts. The court found that the writ petitioner was not automatically entitled to a particular pay scale and that various factors such as rank, duties, responsibilities, and functions of the post needed to be considered.

The court set aside the impugned judgment and order and directed the State Government to take a decision on the revised pay scale for the post of Law Officer in the Board within four months. The writ petitioner would be paid their admissible monthly salary once the decision was made. The writ appeal was allowed subject to the above observation, and there would be no order as to costs.
