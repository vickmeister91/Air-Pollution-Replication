In a recent court order, Manrakhan, who was accused of carrying a tiger skin on a motorcycle, was granted bail. The act of carrying a tiger skin is prohibited under the Wild Life Protection Act, and Manrakhan was facing charges for violating this law. However, the court allowed his bail application without commenting on the merits of the case.

The court ordered Manrakhan to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 60,000 with one solvent surety. This means that he had to provide a sum of money as a guarantee that he would appear in court for his trial. Additionally, he had to provide a solvent surety, which is a person who would be responsible for ensuring that Manrakhan appears in court.

The court also set conditions for Manrakhan's release. He was required to cooperate in the trial and not commit any offense during the period of bail. This means that he had to attend all court hearings and provide any information or evidence that was required of him. He was also not allowed to engage in any criminal activity during the period of his bail.

It is important to note that the court did not comment on the merits of the case. This means that the court did not express an opinion on whether Manrakhan was guilty or innocent of the charges against him. The court simply granted him bail, which is a temporary release from custody while awaiting trial.

Bail is granted to ensure that the accused person appears in court for their trial. It is not a determination of guilt or innocence. The court considers several factors when deciding whether to grant bail, including the seriousness of the offense, the likelihood of the accused person fleeing, and the potential danger they may pose to society.

In this case, the court deemed that Manrakhan was not a flight risk and that he was not likely to pose a danger to society. Therefore, they granted him bail. However, it is important to note that the conditions of his release were set to ensure that he complied with the law and did not pose a risk to society.

In conclusion, the court granted bail to Manrakhan, who was accused of carrying a tiger skin on a motorcycle, which is prohibited under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court allowed the bail application without commenting on the merits of the case and ordered Manrakhan to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 60,000 with one solvent surety. The court also set conditions for his release, including cooperating in the trial and not committing any offense during the period of bail. It is important to note that bail is not a determination of guilt or innocence, but rather a temporary release from custody while awaiting trial.
