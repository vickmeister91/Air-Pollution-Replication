The Kerala High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Thekkedath Karippayi Kunhalavi, who had challenged the withdrawal of a consent granted by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to his unit. The court found that the petitioner had an effective alternate remedy by way of an appeal before the Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. However, the court directed that the operation of the unit and further proceedings pursuant to the withdrawal of consent order shall be kept in abeyance until the Appellate authority considers the appeal preferred by the petitioner on merits. The petitioner was given two weeks to file the appeal, and the Appellate authority was given two months to consider and pass orders on the appeal.

The petitioner had argued that the withdrawal of consent was arbitrary and without any basis. However, the court found that the petitioner had not exhausted the alternate remedy available to him under the law. The court noted that the petitioner had not filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority, which was the appropriate forum to challenge the withdrawal of consent. The court observed that the Appellate Authority was empowered to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances and pass appropriate orders on the appeal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference by the court in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction. The court observed that the writ jurisdiction was a discretionary jurisdiction and that the petitioner had to satisfy the court that there was a violation of his legal rights or that there was a failure of justice. The court found that the petitioner had not made out any such case.

However, the court directed that the operation of the unit and further proceedings pursuant to the withdrawal of consent order shall be kept in abeyance until the Appellate authority considers the appeal preferred by the petitioner on merits. The court observed that this was necessary to ensure that the petitioner was not prejudiced in any manner and that his rights were protected.

The court also directed that the petitioner was given two weeks to file the appeal and that the Appellate authority was given two months to consider and pass orders on the appeal. The court observed that this was necessary to ensure that the appeal was disposed of expeditiously and that the petitioner was not put to any undue hardship.

In conclusion, the Kerala High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by Thekkedath Karippayi Kunhalavi challenging the withdrawal of a consent granted by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board to his unit. The court found that the petitioner had an effective alternate remedy by way of an appeal before the Appellate Authority under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
