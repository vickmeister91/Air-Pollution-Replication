The court order pertains to a First Appeal filed by the U.P. State Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. against Sneh Lata Gupta. The case revolves around an industrial plot in Ghaziabad, for which the defendant-appellant had issued an allotment letter to the plaintiff-respondent. However, the defendant demanded payment of the entire premium, lease rent, interest, and penalty after the plaintiff-respondent failed to start manufacturing within two years. The plaintiff-respondent paid the demanded amount and completed the construction of the factory building, but the defendant-appellant issued a notice to vacate the plot. The plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction, which was decreed by the court below.

The defendant-appellant argued that the impugned judgment was passed without framing issues under Order XIV Rule 1 C.P.C. However, the court found that non-framing of issues was in accordance with the provisions of Order VIII Rule 10 and Order XIV Rule 1 C.P.C. and that the impugned judgment did not suffer from any manifest error of law. The court order discusses the importance of framing issues in civil litigation and the procedures for summary proceedings. The court emphasizes the need for due care and attention in framing issues and the importance of evidence in summary proceedings.

The court also cites previous judgments that discuss the importance of imposing costs and punishing those who abuse the legal process. The court emphasizes that the court should not act blindly or mechanically and should be cautious in proceeding under Order 8 Rule 10 CPC. The court order states that if a defendant does not file a written statement, the court can pass a judgment in favor of the plaintiff without requiring them to prove any facts mentioned in the plaint, but only if there are no disputed questions of fact involved in the case.

The judgment should contain a concise statement of the case, the points for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision. The court must ensure that even if the facts set out in the plaint are treated to have been admitted, a judgment and decree could not possibly be passed without requiring the plaintiff to prove the facts pleaded in the plaint. The court order concludes that the impugned judgment satisfies the requirement of a 'judgment' as defined in Section 2(9) of Civil Procedure Code and the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed.

In summary, the court order deals with a case involving an industrial plot in Ghaziabad, where the defendant demanded payment of the entire premium, lease rent, interest, and penalty after the plaintiff-respondent failed to start manufacturing within two years. The plaintiff-respondent paid the demanded amount and completed the construction of the factory building, but the defendant-appellant issued a notice to vacate the plot. The plaintiff-respondent filed a suit for permanent injunction, which was decreed by the court below.

The court order emphasizes the importance of framing issues in civil litigation and the procedures for summary proceedings. The court also discusses the provisions of Order VIII Rule 10 C.P.C. and the discretion of the court in passing judgment against a defendant who has not filed a written statement. The court emphasizes that the court should not act blindly or mechanically and should be cautious in proceeding under Order 8 Rule 10 CPC.

The court order concludes that the impugned judgment satisfies the requirement of a 'judgment' as defined in Section 2(9) of Civil Procedure Code and the appeal lacks merit and should be dismissed. Overall, the court order provides valuable insights into the procedures and requirements of civil litigation and highlights the importance of due care and attention in framing issues and presenting evidence.
