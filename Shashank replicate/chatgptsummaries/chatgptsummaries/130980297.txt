The court order pertains to a case where the accused, Dilbagh Singh, was charged with offenses under Section 420/406 IPC. The complainant had sold his plot through the accused and purchased two FDRs from Allahabad Bank. Later, the complainant found out that a loan had been taken against his FDRs by the accused, who promised to return the amount within six months but did not. The prosecution relied on photocopies of documents obtained from banks to prove the charge under Section 420 IPC. However, the court found that the basic ingredients of Section 406 IPC were missing, and therefore, the accused was acquitted under that section. The court also found that the prosecution had not proven the charge under Section 420 IPC, and the accused was acquitted of that charge as well.

The court order discusses the analysis of prosecution documents in a case involving a loan taken against FDRs. The documents include letters, debit slips, and cash vouchers. The court questions the admissibility of the documents as they lack the stamp of the manager or authorized person to make them admissible under the Banker Evidence Act. The court also notes that the prosecution failed to prove that the complainant was deceived and made to sign documents for the loan. As a result, the accused is acquitted, and the bail bond is extended until the appeal period expires.
