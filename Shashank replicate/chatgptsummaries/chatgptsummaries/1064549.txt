The court order pertains to a petition filed by an environmentalist challenging the legality of an order issued by the State of Madhya Pradesh, which permitted the collection of tendu leaves from Sanctuaries and National Parks by villagers living around the boundaries. The petitioner argued that this act was ultra vires the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, and violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The petitioner also contended that the order was mala fide and against public interest. The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved judgment.

The court order discusses a writ petition seeking to quash a notification issued by the Government of Madhya Pradesh and to direct the State Government to enforce the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act in relation to National Parks and Sanctuaries. The petitioner objects to the commercial exploitation of minor forest produce, but not to the collection of such produce by villagers for personal use. Three tribals seek to intervene in the proceedings, claiming that they depend on minor forest produce for their survival. The court rejects the petitioner's apprehension that the entry of villagers into National Parks and Sanctuaries would cause forest fires and harm the flora and fauna. The court also notes that the forest cover has increased and not decreased.

The court order discusses the issue of traditional rights of villagers and tribals living in and around sanctuaries and national parks. The State Government had permitted the collection of tendu leaves by issuing a notification in 1995 since the traditional rights of those living in the vicinity of these parks and sanctuaries had not been acquired. The court directs the State Government to take immediate action to acquire the rights of those who claim any right in or over any land proposed to be included in the Sanctuary/National Park and issue a final notification under Section 26A and 35 of the Act declaring such areas as Sanctuaries/National Parks. The State Government is expected to show the required zeal to expeditiously declare and notify the areas as Sanctuaries/National Parks.
