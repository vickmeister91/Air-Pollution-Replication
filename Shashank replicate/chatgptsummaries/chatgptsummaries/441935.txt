The case in question dates back to 1936 when the first respondent filed a suit to enforce the payment of a debt secured by a mortgage of certain properties. In 1942, the properties were sold in execution proceedings and bought by the decree-holder and the second respondent. The judgment-debtor then conveyed the properties to the appellant for a nominal sum. 

The appellant paid the required amount to set aside the sales, but the District Judge refused to do so. The appellant appealed and the court allowed the appeal, setting aside the sales and awarding costs to the appellant. The court also noted that a person buying from a judgment-debtor may apply under Order 21, Rule 89 for an order setting aside the sale.

The case highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with property transactions. The judgment-debtor in this case attempted to transfer the properties to the appellant for a nominal sum in order to avoid paying the debt secured by the mortgage. However, the court recognized the illegality of this transfer and set aside the sales.

Furthermore, the court's ruling emphasized the importance of Order 21, Rule 89, which allows a person buying from a judgment-debtor to apply for an order setting aside the sale. This rule is designed to protect the interests of all parties involved in property transactions and ensure that proper legal procedures are followed.

Overall, this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following proper legal procedures when dealing with property transactions and highlights the protections afforded by Order 21, Rule 89.
