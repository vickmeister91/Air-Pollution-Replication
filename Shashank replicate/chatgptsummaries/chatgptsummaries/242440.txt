The Supreme Court of India heard a case involving the establishment of a slaughterhouse by a public company, Al-Kabeer Exports Limited, in Rudraram village, Andhra Pradesh. The company had obtained various licenses and permissions from the state and central government, including a Letter of Intent subject to certain conditions, such as the prohibition of slaughtering cows and calves and the prevention of air, water, and soil pollution. However, some organizations opposed the establishment of the slaughterhouse, and the matter went to court.

The court directed the state government to prepare a report on the potential environmental impact of the slaughterhouse and its effect on cattle wealth in the area. The Krishnan Committee was formed to examine and report on the matter, and it upheld objections from the Food and Agriculture Department regarding the depletion of cattle wealth in the area. The court order discusses the establishment of a slaughterhouse in Rudraram and the concerns raised by the Food and Agriculture Department about the decreasing cattle wealth in the surrounding areas.

The Krishnan Committee recommended that the company should raise its own feed cattle for at least 50% of its capacity to limit the impact on the existing cattle wealth. The High Court ultimately allowed the establishment of the slaughterhouse, finding that it would have a negligible effect on cattle growth in the state and that the safeguards in place were sufficient to control pollution. However, the court also noted the failure of the Central Government to consider the Krishnan Committee report and pass appropriate orders.

The court suggested that it would be relevant to ascertain the effect of the slaughterhouse on the cattle population and where the cattle were being sourced from. The court also notes that the Krishnan Committee report can be considered after the Central Government submits its report. The Central Government later submits a report stating that the functioning of the slaughterhouse has not resulted in the depletion of buffalo population.

The court order discusses the controversy surrounding the establishment of a slaughterhouse and the need for the Central Government to look into all relevant aspects before a final decision is made. The court also addresses the question of whether the slaughterhouse was established in violation of location requirements, but ultimately concludes that the distance prohibition may not stand in the way of the company getting an industrial license.

The court order discusses the establishment of an industrial undertaking in the District of Medak in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The Central Government issued an industrial license to the company without imposing any conditions on the location of the undertaking. The State Government issued a notification specifying areas that fell within or outside 25 km from the periphery of the standard urban area. The company was located within Rudraram village, which was a prohibited zone from the periphery of the city of Hyderabad.

The court found that the company was entitled to get an industrial license to run the slaughterhouse. The court also discussed the violation of environmental acts and rules by the company. The court found that the company had invested a huge amount for installation of elaborate anti-pollution equipment and operates the same with consent obtained from APPCB. The court directed Al-Kabeer to comply with the Environment Protection Rules by lowering down the pollution levels at the abattoir to permissible limits, rather than to direct closure of the abattoir of the company.

The court order states that the APPCB has the right to take action against Al-Kabeer for violating the terms and conditions of its permission, including directing them to rectify pollution levels and potentially closing down the abattoir. The court also addresses questions about the validity of the APPCB's consent order and the issue of cattle depletion due to the abattoir's operations.

The court ultimately concludes that the NOC was not vitiated by non-disclosure of information and that even if there was a defect in the composition of the APPCB, it would not invalidate the consent order. The court also considers arguments from both sides regarding cattle depletion and ultimately concludes that there is no evidence to support the claim that Al-Kabeer is depleting cattle populations.

The court order from 1997 concluded that there would be no depletion effect on livestock in Andhra Pradesh due to the continuance of Al-Kabeer at full capacity. The report used cattle population figures in block periods of four years before and after the commencement of operations of Al-Kabeer, which was justified. The court found that the findings made in such reports are not open to challenge unless they are shown to be perverse or arbitrary.

The court also noted that the slaughter of animals requires certain conditions to be fulfilled, such as only slaughtering old and useless buffaloes and not slaughtering buffaloes fit for milching, breeding, or draught. The court rejected the appellant's challenge to the veracity and correctness of the figures given in the report of the Central Government and the Quinquennial census. The court also cited previous decisions that the findings of expert bodies in technical and scientific matters would not ordinarily be interfered with by courts.

The court order discusses various submissions made by different parties regarding the functioning of Al-Kabeer abattoir and the policy of the Central Government to promote meat export. The court finds no substance in the contention that no medical experts in the field of clinical medicine were associated with the committees evaluating the studies on the drugs in question.

The court also finds that there is no reason to show concern that the functioning of Al-Kabeer abattoir would result in depletion of buffalo population. The court rejects the submission that the policy
