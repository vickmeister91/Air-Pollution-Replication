The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various aspects of mining and environmental regulations in Orissa. The Orissa Mining Corporation Ltd. filed a writ petition seeking to quash the order passed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests rejecting the Stage-II forest clearance for diversion of forest land for mining of bauxite ore in Lanjigarh Bauxite Mines in Kalahandi and Rayagada Districts of Orissa. The court examined the facts at length and noted that the State of Orissa had submitted a proposal for diversion of forest land for mining bauxite ore in favor of OMC in Kalahandi and Rayagada Districts. The court also outlined the modalities suggested by the court while disposing of the Vedanta case, which involved the proposal for diversion of forest land for the refinery project.

The court order outlines a rehabilitation package that must be followed by the lessee in order to prevent contamination of stream flow, maintain pre-mining water conditions, and conserve wildlife in the project impact area. The user agency must also deposit the NPV of the forest land sought for diversion and prepare a comprehensive plan for the development of tribals in the project impact area. Controlled blasting may be used only in exigencies, and greenery must be developed by way of plantation of suitable indigenous species in all vacant areas within the project. Trees shall be felled from the diverted area only when necessary, and the forest land diverted shall be non-transferable. The court may consider granting clearance to the project if the rehabilitation package is agreed upon. MOEF later considered the request of the State of Orissa seeking prior approval for diversion of forest land for mining of bauxite ore in Lanjigarh Bauxite Mines in favor of OMC, subject to various conditions.

The court order requires M/s SIIL to deposit 5% of its annual profits for Scheduled Area Development and to prevent soil erosion and pollution. The State of Orissa is to create a Special Purpose Vehicle for scheduled area development, and tree felling is to be done in a phased manner under the supervision of the State Forest Department. The Wildlife Management Plan is to be modified and implemented by the State Government/User Agency at the project cost. The lease will remain in the name of Orissa Mining Corporation, and all other provisions under different Acts, rules, and regulations including environmental clearance shall be complied with before transfer of forest land. The final forest clearance will be subject to the final outcome of the Writ petition No. 202 of 1995 from the Hon’ble Supreme Court and Court’s order dated 23.11.2007 and 08.08.2008. MOEF rejected the request for Stage-II Clearance due to the violation of the rights of the Tribal Groups including the Primitive Tribal Groups and the Dalit Population.

The court order discusses violations of the Forest Rights Act and the Environmental Protection Act by Vedanta Alumina Limited in their aluminum refinery project in Orissa. The court finds that the State Government's narrow definition of Project Affected People goes against the Forest Rights Act, and that the violation of protections for Primitive Tribal Groups is unacceptable. The court also notes violations of the Environmental Protection Act, including construction activity for an expansion project without obtaining environmental clearance, and the lack of monitoring for ground water quality. The court emphasizes the importance of considering these violations when granting forest or environmental clearance.

The court order states that the project in question has violated several environmental laws, including the Forest Conservation Act, and cannot be granted Stage II forest clearance. The environmental clearance for the mine is also inoperable. The project proponent is sourcing bauxite from mines without valid environmental clearance, and a show-cause notice is being issued to the project proponent regarding the environmental clearance for the alumina refinery. The Saxena Committee's evidence is compelling, and the violations are too egregious to be ignored. The primary responsibility of the Ministry of Environment and Forests is to enforce the laws passed by Parliament. The legality of the court order is being challenged in a writ petition.

The court order discusses the background of the Vedanta and Sterlite cases, in which the MOEF granted Stage-I approval for the Lanjigarh Bauxite Mining Project. The court evaluates the arguments made by the parties, including the MOEF's decision to reject Stage-II clearance for the project based on violations of the Forest Rights Act and environmental regulations. The court also considers the interdependence of the Alumina Refinery Project and the Bauxite Mining Project, and how violations in one project may affect the other.

The court order pertains to the Forest Rights Act, which recognizes and protects the rights of forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers. The Act grants various rights, including the right to habitation, cultivation, and ownership of forest produce, as well as community rights such as grazing and access to water bodies. The Act also defines terms such as community forest resource, critical wildlife habitat, and forest land. Chapter III of the Act deals with the recognition and vesting of forest rights, while Chapter IV outlines the authorities and procedures for this process. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has issued guidelines to ensure proper implementation of the Act, including the involvement of officials from the Forest and Revenue Departments during the verification of claims and the communication of decisions to claimants.

The court order outlines guidelines for the recognition of forest rights for forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional
