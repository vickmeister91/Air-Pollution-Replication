The Maharashtra Plastic Manufacturers Association and other related associations have filed writ petitions challenging the Maharashtra Plastic and Thermocol Products (Manufacture, Usage, Sale, Transport, Handling and Storage) Notification, 2018. The Maharashtra Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 2006 is not being challenged. The relevant sections of the Act are 3, 4, 9, and 18, which prohibit the throwing of non-biodegradable garbage in public drains, sewage lines, natural or manmade lakes, and wetlands. The court has issued a rule and heard arguments for interim relief.

The court order prohibits the placement of non-biodegradable garbage or construction debris in a way that could harm the drainage and sewage system, affect the treatment and disposal of drain and sewage contents, be dangerous or cause a nuisance, or damage the environment. It also restricts the use of certain non-biodegradable materials and imposes penalties for contravention of the provisions. The State Government has the power to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The impugned notification, issued under the Act, defines various terms related to plastic and imposes restrictions on the use of certain plastic products.

The court order discusses a notification issued by the Maharashtra government that bans the manufacture, usage, transport, distribution, wholesale and retail sale, and storage and import of certain plastic items. The order explains the definitions and activities regulated by the notification, as well as exemptions and amendments made to it. The ban on regulated items came into force on March 23, 2018, and a period of three months was given for disposal of existing stock. The petitioners argue that the rule-making power under the relevant act can only be exercised after publication of norms in the official gazette and the existence of standards for biodegradability and recyclability.

The court order discusses various submissions made regarding the legality of an impugned notification issued by the State Government. It is argued that the rule-making power under section 18 of the Act of 2006 can only be exercised in the manner provided under section 18, which includes laying of rules before each House of the State Legislature. The court is also informed that the exercise of power under sub-section (1) of section 4 is already occupied by existing statutory rules. The court is further informed that the impugned notification is illegal and ultra vires of the said Act of 2006, and it infringes the fundamental rights guaranteed to the manufacturers and sellers of the plastic items under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. The court is also informed that the State Government has committed a breach of its own solemn assurance. The court is urged to stay the impugned notification.

The court order discusses the legality of a notification issued by the State government to regulate the use of non-biodegradable material and prevent its disposal in public spaces. The court concludes that the government has the power to impose restrictions and fix norms for material degradability or recyclability through a notification published in the official gazette. The court also notes that the notification does not impose a ban on the manufacture of PET and PETE bottles but rather imposes requirements for their use, sale, and storage. The court upholds the restrictions imposed on single-use disposable items made up of plastic or thermocol, which pose a threat to the environment.

The court order discusses a notification issued by the State Government of Maharashtra to restrict the use of plastic bags and other disposable plastic items due to their harmful impact on the environment and health. The court finds that the restrictions are reasonable and necessary to prevent the throwing or depositing of non-biodegradable garbage in public areas. The court also refers to a previous case where the Apex Court held that the reasonableness of restrictions on fundamental rights must be balanced against the greater public or social interest.

The court order discusses the imposition of reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights, particularly in cases where the law provides for the grant of a license or permit. The court emphasizes the need to balance the direct impact on citizens' fundamental rights against the greater public and social interest sought to be ensured. The court also cites the Constitution's directive principles of State policy, which enjoin upon the State to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country. The court concludes that the ban on the production of certain disposable plastic and thermocol items was taken to make the prohibition on their use more effective and to protect the environment.

The court order discusses the restrictions imposed on the use of plastic items in the state of Maharashtra, India. The court holds that while examining the reasonableness of restrictions on fundamental rights, the directive principles of the State Policy must be considered to strike a just balance between fundamental rights and larger interests of society. The court also discusses the doctrine of proportionality and lays down factors to be considered while examining reasonableness. The court finds that the restrictions imposed by the impugned notification are reasonable and in the larger public interest, considering the adverse impact of plastic waste on the environment and citizens. The court denies the prayer for a stay on the operation and execution of the impugned notification. The court also discusses the disposal of restricted plastic items possessed by individuals and the role of local bodies in creating a proper mechanism for disposal.

The court order states that individuals who use restricted items from March 23, 2016, will face criminal prosecution. The local bodies must create a proper
