The court order pertains to a petition filed against an order passed by the National Green Tribunal in a case related to illegal mining in Madhya Pradesh. The State Government argued that the petitioner had not come with clean hands and that the remedy available was to approach the Supreme Court. The court referred to an earlier order in an identical case and listed the matter for further hearing. The order also includes details of the restoration plan and the liability of mining lease holders and stone crushers. The National Green Tribunal had imposed a fine on each mining lease holder.

The court order directs the restoration plan for the area to be put into operation as soon as possible in a phased manner. The mining leaseholders are required to pay an amount of Rs. 1 lakh per hectare, and the stone crushers are required to deposit an amount of Rs. 1 lakh initially, with subsequent installments of Rs. 1 lakh each. The amount of Rs. 5 lakhs by each mining leaseholder must be deposited with the DFO Dew as at the rate of Rs. 1 lakh per hectare. Notices will be issued for recovery of the amount, and in case of failure to pay, orders for attachment of property will be issued. The State is responsible for carrying out the restoration plan. The writ petition filed by the petitioner is not maintainable and is dismissed.
