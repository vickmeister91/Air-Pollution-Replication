The court orders discussed in this summary pertain to various disputes related to properties in Delhi. In the first case, Arvind Singhal filed a suit against Max Therapiya Limited, alleging that the defendant was using the property for commercial purposes in violation of the approved layout plan and zoning regulations. The plaintiff sought a restraining order and mandatory injunction against the defendant. The defendant denied the allegations and argued that the suit was an abuse of process. The court was considering several pending applications in the case.

In the second case, the plaintiffs were trying to interfere with the Archaeological Survey of India's (ASI) jurisdiction over the repair work being carried out by defendant No.1 in a property. The defendant had obtained permission from ASI and necessary approvals from local authorities for the repair work. The court stated that the plaintiffs could not challenge the permissions granted by ASI and local authorities and that the suit was liable to be dismissed for non-joinder of proper and necessary parties. The court also discussed the issue of whether the repairs and renovation being carried out by defendant No.1 required prior permissions from MCD and ASI or not.

The third case involved a dispute over the renovation and repair of a property. The defendant had received conditional permission from the ASI, subject to certain conditions, but the plaintiff argued that these conditions were not fulfilled. The plaintiff also sought a declaration that the permission granted by the MCD was illegal and void. The court found that the concerns raised by the plaintiff were beyond its jurisdiction and that the plaintiff was trying to interfere with the scope of the ASI, which is not permitted under the ASI Act. The court also noted that the plaintiffs were at liberty to challenge the decision before a higher authority.

In the fourth case, the court stated that the plaintiff had the liberty to challenge the decision before a higher authority in accordance with the law. The court also referred to previous cases where it was held that a civil suit is maintainable in disputes where a person violates the provisions of the Municipality Act and Rules and causes disturbance to the civil rights of others. The court concluded that in the present circumstances, a civil suit is maintainable and a perpetual injunction can be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation existing in favor of a party.

In the fifth case, the court dismissed two cases and found that a civil suit is maintainable and a perpetual injunction can be granted to prevent the breach of an obligation. The court also discussed the requirements for changing the use of a property from residential to non-residential or commercial and the necessary permissions and sanctions that must be obtained. The court referred to previous cases and laws to support its findings.

In the sixth case, the court stated that the Development Act, Corporation Act, and Building Byelaws must be followed, and that residential areas can only be used for residential purposes. The court also noted that the MPD-2021 permits certain activities in residential plots, subject to compliance with certain requirements. The defendant in the case sought to use the residential property for a nursing home, which was permitted under the MPD-2021. The court found that the defendant had complied with the requirements and that the plaintiffs had no right to object. The court also noted that the MCD Act did not require any additional permission for the defendant to use the property for the intended purpose.

In the final case, the court stated that for calculating the distance from a property, the total width of the road from the service lane to the ring road must be taken into account. The owner of a property is entitled to use it for any lawful purpose as per the MPD-2021 and existing laws and rules. However, in the present case, specific written permission from the MCD was required, and the application and objections were pending. The court directed the defendant No.3 to pass an appropriate order after hearing and inspection within four weeks. All pending applications were disposed of.

In summary, these court orders dealt with various disputes related to properties in Delhi, including violations of zoning regulations, permissions for repair and renovation work, changing the use of a property, and the entitlement of property owners to use their properties for lawful purposes. The court referred to previous cases and laws to support its findings and directed the parties to comply with the relevant regulations and obtain necessary permissions.
