The Supreme Court of India recently upheld a judgment by the High Court of Uttaranchal in a case between Shankar and Surendra Singh Rawat. The respondents had purchased a property and alleged that the appellants had encroached upon it and put up construction. The Trial Court decreed the suit and granted permanent injunction in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs and also ordered demolition of the construction raised in the property by the appellants. The First Appellate Court dismissed the appeal, but held that the respondents/plaintiffs are not entitled to receive compensation/mense profit for use and occupation as ordered by the Trial Court. The Second Appeal preferred by the appellants/defendants was dismissed by the High Court. The Supreme Court found no good ground to interfere with the concurrent findings of the Courts below regarding the rejection of plea of adverse possession raised by the appellants.

The court order states that the plaintiff/respondents had sought perpetual and mandatory injunction relief in a suit. The court found that the jurisdiction of the civil court is only ousted by virtue of Section 331 of the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, if the defendant was a tenant under the said Act. The court also reiterated that Section 331 read with Schedule II bars the jurisdiction of the civil court only in respect of such reliefs which are mentioned in Schedule II and for adjudication of which, a specific authority has been prescribed thereunder. The court dismissed the appeal as the title of the respondents/plaintiffs was not in question and the appellants raised alternative defenses of title pursuant to an unregistered sale document and also of adverse possession.

In the first case, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the lower courts to grant permanent injunction in favour of the respondents and order the demolition of the construction raised by the appellants. The respondents had purchased the property and alleged that the appellants had encroached upon it and put up construction. The Trial Court had decreed the suit and granted permanent injunction in favour of the respondents/plaintiffs and also ordered demolition of the construction raised in the property by the appellants. The First Appellate Court dismissed the appeal, but held that the respondents/plaintiffs are not entitled to receive compensation/mense profit for use and occupation as ordered by the Trial Court. The Second Appeal preferred by the appellants/defendants was dismissed by the High Court. The Supreme Court found no good ground to interfere with the concurrent findings of the Courts below regarding the rejection of plea of adverse possession raised by the appellants.

In the second case, the plaintiff/respondents had sought perpetual and mandatory injunction relief in a suit. The court found that the jurisdiction of the civil court is only ousted by virtue of Section 331 of the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950, if the defendant was a tenant under the said Act. The court also reiterated that Section 331 read with Schedule II bars the jurisdiction of the civil court only in respect of such reliefs which are mentioned in Schedule II and for adjudication of which, a specific authority has been prescribed thereunder. The court dismissed the appeal as the title of the respondents/plaintiffs was not in question and the appellants raised alternative defenses of title pursuant to an unregistered sale document and also of adverse possession.

In both cases, the courts have upheld the rights of the plaintiffs/respondents and rejected the claims of the defendants/appellants. The first case involved a dispute over property ownership and the construction of a building, while the second case involved a claim for perpetual and mandatory injunction relief. In both cases, the courts have carefully considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and have made their decisions based on the law and the facts of the case.

Overall, these court orders demonstrate the importance of seeking legal advice and representation when involved in a legal dispute. The courts have a duty to carefully consider all the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and to make their decisions based on the law and the facts of the case. It is important for individuals and businesses to understand their legal rights and obligations and to seek legal advice when necessary to protect their interests and ensure that their rights are upheld.
