The court order pertains to multiple writ petitions filed under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, challenging the notification issued by the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) inviting tenders for solid waste disposal and management. The petitioners are existing contractors who provide services for the collection and transportation of municipal solid waste and street cleaning. The court order details the background of the case, including previous challenges to tender notifications and changes made to the tender documents. The petitioners in this case challenge the addendum issued on 26.9.2012, which altered certain terms and conditions of the tender.

The court found that the changes made to the tender documents were without proper notification and were contrary to the standard tender document and government circulars. The court also found that the reservation for Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes was impermissible and that the approval of the tender in favor of the respondent was arbitrary and illegal. The court ordered the quashing of the tender notifications and the redoing of the tenders.

In another case related to the same tender process, the court found that the respondents' actions were arbitrary and discriminatory, denying the petitioners a fair opportunity to participate. The court found that a concession given to SC/ST groups in the tender process was discriminatory and violated Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. The court also noted that the reservation under Article 16 or 15 only applies to public employment or admission to educational institutions and not to public contracts. The court ultimately found that the tender notification issued by the respondent was liable to be quashed on the grounds of arbitrariness, discrimination, being contrary to law, and opposed to public interest.

The court order discusses the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Act and Rules, which provide a comprehensive process for procurement of goods and services by procurement entities transparently by streamlining the procedure in inviting, processing and acceptance of tenders. The order also mentions the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, which define the responsibility of municipal authorities for the implementation of the provisions of the rules and for any infrastructure development for collection, storage, segregation, transportation, processing and disposal of municipal solid wastes. The order emphasizes that when these statutory provisions are contravened, the aggrieved persons have approached the courts for redressal.

The court order discusses the legal position in contractual matters, particularly in government contracts. The government must act fairly and without discrimination when dealing with the public, and its actions must be in conformity with rational, relevant, and non-discriminatory standards or norms. The court must grant a certain measure of freedom to the executive in complex economic matters, and it cannot interfere with economic policy, which is the function of experts. The court's function is to ensure that lawful authority is not abused, but not to appropriate to itself the task entrusted to that authority.

The court order discusses the scope of judicial review in contractual matters and tender conditions. The court states that the government and its undertakings have the freedom to set the terms of the tender, and interference by courts is only warranted if it is arbitrary, discriminatory, malafide, or actuated by bias. The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny because it is in the realm of contract. The court also discusses the standard tender document and its applicability to procurement entities under the government. The government has the right to modify the document to suit their needs, but any modification should not result in arbitrariness or discrimination. The court concludes that the modifications made to the tender document were valid and applicable to the procurement entity under the government.

The court order deals with various contentions raised regarding a tender issued by the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike, a local authority constituted under the provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976. The court dismisses the argument that the tender is not in conformity with the standard tender form and that the Corporation had departed from the procedure which they were following. The court also upholds the short term tender granting 7 days time and the concession given to the SC/ST community in the tender process.

The court order states that a government concession for paying 10% of the EMD amount and solvency certificate was meant for societies of persons belonging to SC/ST community and not for individuals. The court found that providing such concession to individuals was without the authority of law and discriminatory. The court also discussed the power of the tender accepting authority to issue an addendum changing the conditions in the tender document and found that the changes made were not arbitrary, discriminatory, malafide, or actuated by bias. The intention behind the changes was to break the monopoly of certain contractors and promote healthy competition. The court also noted the formation of a cartel by some contractors and the negative impact it had on the disposal of municipal solid waste in Bangalore.

The court order discusses the formation of a cartel by producers to control production, sale, and prices of a product to obtain a monopoly in a particular industry or commodity. Such formation is considered an unfair trade practice and not in the public interest. The court emphasizes that in complex economic matters, decisions are empirical and based on experimentation, and it is not the function of the courts to interfere with economic policy. The order also discusses subsequent events related to the tender process and the challenges faced by the successful bidder in executing the work as per the tender conditions. BVG India
