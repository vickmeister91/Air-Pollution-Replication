The Karnataka High Court recently issued a court order pertaining to a writ petition filed by M/s Manjunatha Stone Crusher and two other companies against the State of Karnataka, the Department of Mines and Geology, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, and other respondents. The petitioners sought to quash a closure notice issued by the second respondent and to direct the competent authority to consider their applications to operate their stone crushing units.

The court found that the petition was similar to a previous writ action and ordered that the closure notices be quashed and the petitioners be allowed to operate their units at the present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. The rule has been issued and made absolute, and there will be no order as to costs.

The court order is significant as it allows the petitioners to continue operating their stone crushing units at the present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority. This is a relief for the petitioners who were facing closure of their units due to the closure notice issued by the second respondent.

The court order also highlights the importance of considering applications for operating stone crushing units in a timely manner. The petitioners had applied for permission to operate their units, but their applications had not been considered by the licensing authority. This delay had led to the issuance of the closure notice by the second respondent.

The court order is a reminder to the licensing authority to consider applications for operating stone crushing units in a timely manner to avoid unnecessary litigation and closure of units. It is also a reminder to the State of Karnataka, the Department of Mines and Geology, and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to ensure that the licensing authority is functioning efficiently and effectively.

In conclusion, the court order issued by the Karnataka High Court in the writ petition filed by M/s Manjunatha Stone Crusher and two other companies is significant as it allows the petitioners to continue operating their stone crushing units at the present site until their applications are considered and disposed of by the licensing authority. The court order also highlights the importance of considering applications for operating stone crushing units in a timely manner to avoid unnecessary litigation and closure of units.
