The Telangana High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by the petitioners against an order made by the Pollution Control Board under the Water and Air Acts. The court stated that since there is an effective statutory remedy available before the National Green Tribunal, there are no exceptional circumstances to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court dismissed the writ petition and left it open to the petitioners to work out their remedy of appeal.

The case involved a dispute between the petitioners and the Pollution Control Board over the alleged violation of environmental laws. The petitioners had approached the High Court seeking relief against an order made by the Pollution Control Board. However, the court found that the petitioners had an effective statutory remedy available before the National Green Tribunal and therefore, there were no exceptional circumstances to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

The court's decision was based on the principle of exhaustion of remedies, which requires a party to exhaust all available remedies before approaching a higher court. The court noted that the National Green Tribunal was established to deal with environmental disputes and had the power to hear appeals against orders made by the Pollution Control Board. Therefore, the court found that the petitioners should have approached the National Green Tribunal instead of filing a writ petition before the High Court.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following the proper legal procedures when seeking relief against government orders. It also emphasizes the need for parties to exhaust all available remedies before approaching a higher court. This principle ensures that the lower courts and tribunals are given the opportunity to resolve disputes before they are escalated to higher courts, which can be time-consuming and expensive.

In conclusion, the Telangana High Court's decision to dismiss the writ petition filed by the petitioners against the Pollution Control Board's order under the Water and Air Acts was based on the principle of exhaustion of remedies. The court found that since there was an effective statutory remedy available before the National Green Tribunal, there were no exceptional circumstances to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures and exhausting all available remedies before approaching a higher court.
