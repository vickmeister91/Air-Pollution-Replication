The National Green Tribunal recently heard a case regarding contaminated water being supplied in the Lalji Sand Ka Rasta locality of Jaipur. The Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board submitted a report stating that four sewage treatment plants have been installed and are in operation, but it did not specify the amount of sewage generated in the area. The State of Rajasthan submitted a report stating that the work of replacing pollution-prone pipelines has been completed in Jaipur, but only 12.60 km of pipeline could be replaced out of 68.57 km. The quality of water in Jaipur City is regularly monitored, and water testing reports show that the water quality has been satisfactory.

The court order states that the water quality in the area is regularly monitored and that a small amount of fine sand may be present in the water from local tube wells, but the department has not added any sand to the water pipeline as alleged by the complainant. The court finds that the grievance raised by the applicant has been addressed by the respondents and no further directions are needed. The State of Rajasthan is ordered to file required information clarifying steps taken on rectifying the shortfall of work undertaken for laying fresh pipelines and regarding the total quantity of sewerage being generated within four weeks. The matter will be listed for noting compliance on April 16th, 2014.
