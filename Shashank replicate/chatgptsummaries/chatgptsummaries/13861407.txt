The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Sunanda against Rajanna and others, seeking to quash an order passed by the Court of Additional Senior Civil Judge and CJM at Tumkur in O.S.No.162/2007. The suit was for a decree of partition and separate possession of the suit properties. The court dismissed the suit against respondents 3 to 10 on a preliminary issue of maintainability, which was framed by the court. The petitioner argued that the court had no justification for framing the issue, while the respondents argued that the order amounted to a decree and the petitioner had an alternate remedy of appeal. The court examined the matter on merits and held that the trial court had the power to frame any issue and dismissed the writ petition.

The court examined the main matter on merits and rejected the petitioner's contention that the trial court had no justification for framing an issue on the maintainability of the suit against the respondents. The trial court had the power to frame any issue at any stage of the suit, and had framed an issue on maintainability based on evidence tendered by the petitioner. The court found that pre-amendment bona fide purchasers of the properties were not liable to have their rights/interests disturbed. The court also rejected the petitioner's contention that no issue could have been framed as the respondents had not filed their written statement, as filing a written statement is not a condition precedent for framing an issue on maintainability. The writ petition was dismissed.
