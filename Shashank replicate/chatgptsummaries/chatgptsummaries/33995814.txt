The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal case in the State of Maharashtra. The appointed counsel for the respondents has requested the court to consider the applicability of section 376(E) in the present facts, but the learned APP has opposed this arrangement. The court has decided not to frame or hear any preliminary issue on the use of section 376(E) and has kept all contentions open to be heard as part of the present confirmation proceedings. The confirmation matter is listed for final hearing on 24/6/2019.

Section 376(E) of the Indian Penal Code deals with the punishment for repeat offenders of rape. It states that whoever has been previously convicted of an offence punishable under section 376 or section 376A or section 376D and is subsequently convicted of an offence punishable under any of the said sections shall be punished with imprisonment for life which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life.

In the present case, the respondents have requested the court to consider the applicability of section 376(E) in light of the fact that the accused has been previously convicted of an offence punishable under section 376. However, the learned APP has opposed this arrangement, and the court has decided not to frame or hear any preliminary issue on the use of section 376(E).

Instead, the court has kept all contentions open to be heard as part of the present confirmation proceedings. This means that both parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence in support of their respective positions during the confirmation proceedings.

The confirmation proceedings are scheduled for final hearing on 24/6/2019. During this hearing, the court will consider all of the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and will make a final determination as to whether section 376(E) is applicable in the present case.

It is important to note that the court's decision not to frame or hear any preliminary issue on the use of section 376(E) does not necessarily mean that the section will not be applicable in the present case. Rather, it simply means that the court has decided to consider the issue as part of the confirmation proceedings, rather than as a separate preliminary issue.

Overall, the court order in question highlights the importance of careful consideration and analysis of the relevant legal provisions in criminal cases. It also underscores the need for both parties to present their arguments and evidence in a clear and concise manner in order to ensure a fair and just outcome.
