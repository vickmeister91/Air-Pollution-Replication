In a recent criminal revision petition, the petitioner, Manu, sought direction from the court to the nodal officer of Idea Cellular Service to produce mobile tower details in respect of two mobile phone numbers belonging to the complainant in a case. However, the court dismissed the revision petition as not maintainable and directed the registry to return the necessary papers to the petitioner's counsel.

The petitioner's argument was that the mobile tower details were crucial to the case and would help establish the location of the complainant at the time of the alleged incident. However, the court found that the petitioner had not made a strong enough case for the production of the mobile tower details and that the request was not maintainable.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner had not provided sufficient evidence to support the need for the mobile tower details. The court also noted that the petitioner had not followed the proper procedure for obtaining such information and that the request was not in accordance with the law.

The court's decision highlights the importance of following proper legal procedures when seeking information in a criminal case. It also emphasizes the need for strong evidence to support any requests for information, particularly when it comes to sensitive data such as mobile tower details.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder to all parties involved in criminal cases to ensure that they follow proper legal procedures and provide strong evidence to support their requests for information. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of the request and potentially harm the outcome of the case.
