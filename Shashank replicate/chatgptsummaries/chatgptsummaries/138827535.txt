The court order in question pertains to a dispute between Ultratech Cement Ltd and the Commissioner of Central Excise, Nagpur regarding the admissibility of CENVAT credit of service tax paid on certification of pollution level during the period of dispute. The appellant had availed the service of certification of pollution level in their factory premises from two agencies and had taken CENVAT credit of the service tax paid by the said agencies on the service of certification of pollution level. The department sought to recover the amounts of CENVAT credit from the appellant on the ground that any service in relation to inspection or certification of pollution level was not a taxable service and consequently credit of any service tax on such service was not admissible.

The dispute centered around the question of whether the service of certification of pollution level was a taxable service or not. The lower authorities had held that it was not a taxable service and therefore the appellant was not entitled to take credit of the service tax paid by the service providers. However, the court held that the lower authorities had no jurisdiction to decide on the taxability of the service in question and that the appellant was entitled to take credit of the service tax so paid by the service providers.

The court's decision was based on a careful analysis of the relevant provisions of the law and the facts of the case. The court noted that the service of certification of pollution level was a service that was used by the appellant in the course of their business and was therefore eligible for CENVAT credit. The court also noted that the service providers had paid service tax on the service of certification of pollution level and that the appellant had taken credit of the same in their CENVAT account. The court held that the appellant was entitled to take credit of the service tax paid by the service providers and that the department had no right to recover the same.

The court's decision is significant as it clarifies the position of law with respect to the admissibility of CENVAT credit of service tax paid on certification of pollution level.
