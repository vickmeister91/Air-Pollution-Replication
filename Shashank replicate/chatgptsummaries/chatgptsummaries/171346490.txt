The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Anil Kumar Choudhary against the State of Rajasthan and other respondents. The petitioner is seeking relief from a demand notice issued by the Mining Engineer, Banswara, and wants the respondents to be restrained from interfering in his mining activity. The matter is similar to a previous judgment in M/s. Hari Priya Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.

The court examines the issue of diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the requirement for the Mining Department to deposit compensation charges with the Forest Department. The court also discusses the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in 2015, which requires the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) for maintaining ecological balance.

The court reserves judgment on the matter.

In another court order, the court discusses the deposit of NPV (Net Present Value) for the diversion of forest land for mining purposes. The NPV for a cluster of land measuring 281 hectares is Rs. 17,59,06,000/-, which has to be deposited in the bank account. The demand for the NPV was raised by the Assistant Mining Engineer, Rishabhdev, Udaipur, and the Forest Department has asked for the second installment of the NPV to be deposited.

The petitioners argue that they are being charged for vacant/surrendered/non-functional mining leases and common areas, which is not permissible.

In yet another court order, the court discusses arguments made by both the petitioners and respondents regarding the calculation of Net Present Value (NPV) for forest land falling in a mining lease. The petitioners argue that the provisions of NPV should not apply to forest land falling in a mining lease for which renewal has been rejected, while the respondents argue that the State Government can relinquish the area of cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested lease holders.

The court also references various annexures and guidelines related to forest conservation and cluster mining proposals.

In another court order, the court pertains to a demand notice for payment of Net Present Value (NPV) for extension of the period of validity for approval accorded under Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, for a cluster area of 281 hectares situated in Gram Oadwas, Tehsil Kherwada, District Udaipur.

The mining lease holders collectively submitted a diversion proposal of the forest land for the entire cluster area, and the approval was given on 07.02.2000 for the entire area of 281 hectares valid up to 28.10.2017.

The court directs the respondents to compute the NPV amount towards the individual forest land being held by each of the lease holders along with their share in the unbroken area of 105.1538 hectares, which is a common area for storing their machines and equipment and other infrastructure, which includes offices and houses of workers, etc., constructed on the said area along with the dumping area.

In the final court order, the court directs that the rate of NPV amount shall be Rs.6,26,000/- per hectare for forest land falling in mining leases that have not been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. However, the forest land falling in the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases shall be excluded from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV.

The court also directs the respondents to compute the NPV afresh for the mining lease holders individually in accordance with the judgment rendered by the Hon'ble Apex Court in T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad (104) Vs. Union of India & Ors. (supra).

The total common area being used commonly by the mining lease holders in the cluster shall be divided equally amongst the active mining lease holders per hectare.

In summary, the court orders discussed various issues related to the diversion of forest land for mining purposes and the requirement for the Mining Department to deposit compensation charges with the Forest Department. The court also discussed the notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in 2015, which requires the Mining Department to deposit the Net Present Value (NPV) for maintaining ecological balance.

The court directed the respondents to compute the NPV amount towards the individual forest land being held by each of the lease holders along with their share in the common area. The court also directed that the rate of NPV amount shall be Rs.6,26,000/- per hectare for forest land falling in mining leases that have not been cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested. However, the forest land falling in the cancelled/surrendered/lapsed/not interested mining leases shall be excluded from the total area of 281 hectares while computing the NPV.
