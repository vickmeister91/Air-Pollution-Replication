The court order in question pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Prakash Chand Srivastava against the appointment of Alok Ranjan as Chief Secretary of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The petitioner sought a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus restraining the government from appointing Ranjan to the post of Chief Secretary, pending trial of two criminal cases against him. The court heard arguments from both sides and raised preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the PIL in service matters. The court also referred to previous cases where appointments to high public and statutory offices were challenged through PILs.

The court order states that the government is responsible for the administration and is answerable to the people for its successes and failures. The Chief Minister can shift the Chief Secretary to another post if they lose confidence in them, as long as it does not violate any legal or constitutional rights. The court also notes that some posts require specialized experience and the government must make the best possible choice for the larger interests of the administration. The court further states that Public Interest Litigation is not maintainable in service matters and the dispute relates to the incidence of service. The court dismisses the writ petition challenging the appointment of respondent no. 3 as Chief Secretary of State of U.P. and his functioning as Agricultural Production Commissioner and Industrial Development Commissioner.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the role of the government in making appointments to high public and statutory offices. The court notes that the government is responsible for the administration and is answerable to the people for its successes and failures. This means that the government must make the best possible choice for the larger interests of the administration. The court also notes that some posts require specialized experience and expertise, and the government must take this into account when making appointments.

The court also clarifies the role of the Chief Minister in making appointments. The Chief Minister can shift the Chief Secretary to another post if they lose confidence in them, as long as it does not violate any legal or constitutional rights. This means that the Chief Minister has the power to make changes to the administration as they see fit, but they must do so within the bounds of the law.

The court also addresses the issue of Public Interest Litigation in service matters. The court notes that Public Interest Litigation is not maintainable in service matters and the dispute relates to the incidence of service. This means that PILs cannot be used to challenge appointments to high public and statutory offices, as these are service matters.

Overall, the court order provides clarity on the role of the government in making appointments to high public and statutory offices, as well as the role of the Chief Minister in making changes to the administration. The court also clarifies the limitations of Public Interest Litigation in service matters, which will have implications for future cases.
