The Delhi High Court has issued an order pertaining to a public interest litigation seeking a ban on the manufacture, use, sale, and purchase of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread and all similar synthetic threads used in kite flying in Delhi. The petitioner argues that the thread is dangerous and has caused severe injuries to birds and humans. The government of NCT of Delhi has informed the court that a draft notification proposing a ban has been prepared and is being vetted by the Law Department. 

The court has suggested that advisories be issued to create awareness about the dangers of using synthetic manja/nylon kite thread until the notification is issued. The court has rejected the petitioner's request for prohibitory orders to be issued without inviting objections from the public. The court requires more data and evaluation before taking such action. 

The use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread has been a contentious issue in Delhi for several years. The thread is made of nylon or plastic and is coated with powdered glass or metal, making it razor-sharp. It is used to cut the thread of other kites during kite-flying competitions. However, the thread poses a severe threat to birds, especially migratory birds that fly over Delhi during the winter months. The thread can get entangled in their wings, causing severe injuries and even death. 

The use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread also poses a threat to humans. There have been several instances of people getting injured or even killed by the thread while riding motorcycles or driving cars. The thread can get entangled in the wheels of vehicles, causing accidents. 

The court's order is a step in the right direction towards addressing the issue of the use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread. The court has recognized the dangers posed by the thread and has suggested that advisories be issued to create awareness about the same. The court has also directed the government of NCT of Delhi to expedite the process of inviting suggestions/objections from the public and issue a notification to tackle the adverse effects of kite flying threads as soon as possible. 

The court's order is significant as it recognizes the need for public participation in decision-making. The court has rejected the petitioner's request for prohibitory orders to be issued without inviting objections from the public. The court requires more data and evaluation before taking such action. This approach is in line with the principles of democracy and ensures that all stakeholders have a say in the decision-making process. 

The use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread is not only a problem in Delhi but also in other parts of the country. Several states have already banned the use of the thread, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. However, the ban has not been effectively implemented, and the use of the thread continues. 

The court's order is a significant step towards addressing the issue of the use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread. The court has recognized the dangers posed by the thread and has suggested that advisories be issued to create awareness about the same. The court has also directed the government of NCT of Delhi to expedite the process of inviting suggestions/objections from the public and issue a notification to tackle the adverse effects of kite flying threads as soon as possible. 

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court's order on the use of synthetic manja/nylon kite thread is a step in the right direction towards addressing the issue. The court has recognized the dangers posed by the thread and has suggested that advisories be issued to create awareness about the same. The court has also directed the government of NCT of Delhi to expedite the process of inviting suggestions/objections from the public and issue a notification to tackle the adverse effects of kite flying threads as soon as possible. The court's order is significant as it recognizes the need for public participation in decision-making and ensures that all stakeholders have a say in the decision-making process.
