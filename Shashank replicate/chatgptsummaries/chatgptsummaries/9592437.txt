In a recent court order, the case of Subhash Tak and Electro Plaza was brought to light. The issue at hand was a bounced cheque that Tak had issued to Electro Plaza. In response, the petitioner filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to produce a statement of account, ledger, bills, etc. to prove that no goods were supplied to the petitioner. However, the court dismissed the application, stating that there is a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque and that a fishing and roving inquiry is not permitted.

The court's decision was based on the fact that there is a legal presumption in favour of the holder of a cheque. This means that the holder of the cheque is presumed to have received the goods or services for which the cheque was issued. In this case, Electro Plaza was the holder of the cheque, and therefore, the court presumed that they had supplied goods to Tak.

The court also noted that a fishing and roving inquiry is not permitted in such cases. This means that the petitioner cannot simply ask for any and all documents to prove their case. Instead, they must provide specific evidence to support their claim. In this case, the petitioner was unable to provide any evidence to support their claim that no goods were supplied to them.

The court found no merit in the petition and dismissed it. This means that the petitioner's claim was not supported by any evidence and therefore, the court could not rule in their favour. The court's decision was based on the legal presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque and the fact that the petitioner was unable to provide any evidence to support their claim.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of providing specific evidence to support a claim in cases involving bounced cheques. It also emphasizes the legal presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque and the limitations on the type of inquiry that can be conducted in such cases.
