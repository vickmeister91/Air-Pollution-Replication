The judgment and order of the trial court were confirmed.

The case involved KA Male Pharma Ltd. and six others who were accused of discharging untreated water into the environment, which was a violation of the consent given by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board. The Board filed a criminal appeal against the acquittal of the accused by the trial court. The trial court had acquitted the accused due to the prosecution's failure to follow mandatory rules and lack of evidence.

The Gujarat Pollution Control Board argued that the trial court had erred in acquitting the accused and that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove their guilt. The Board contended that the accused had violated the consent given by the Board and had discharged untreated water into the environment, which was harmful to public health and the environment.

The High Court, however, dismissed the appeal and upheld the trial court's decision to acquit the accused. The High Court stated that the trial court's findings were just and proper and that there was no reason to interfere with the acquittal. The High Court also noted that the prosecution had failed to follow mandatory rules and had not presented sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused.

The High Court's decision was based on the principle of "presumption of innocence," which is a fundamental principle of criminal law. The principle of presumption of innocence means that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the High Court found that the prosecution had failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, and therefore, the accused were entitled to the benefit of the doubt.

The High Court's decision is significant because it reaffirms the importance of the principle of presumption of innocence in criminal law. The decision also highlights the need for prosecutors to follow mandatory rules and present sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
