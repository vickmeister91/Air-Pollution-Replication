The Jharkhand High Court recently granted anticipatory bail to Bablu Sardar, who was accused of owning one of two trucks loaded with illegally mined sand in connection with a case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Jharkhand Minor Mineral Rule, and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act. The court directed that Sardar be released on bail upon surrender or arrest, on furnishing a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti, subject to the conditions laid down under Section 438(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The case against Sardar was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Sub-Divisional Officer, Khunti, alleging that two trucks loaded with illegally mined sand were intercepted by the police on their way to a crusher plant. The police seized the trucks and arrested the drivers, who revealed that the trucks belonged to Sardar. The police subsequently filed a charge sheet against Sardar, accusing him of owning one of the trucks and being involved in the illegal mining and transportation of sand.

Sardar approached the Jharkhand High Court seeking anticipatory bail, contending that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. He argued that he had no knowledge of the illegal mining and transportation of sand and that he had purchased the truck in question from a third party. He further submitted that he was a law-abiding citizen and had no criminal antecedents.

The prosecution opposed Sardar's bail plea, contending that he was a habitual offender and had been involved in several cases of illegal mining and transportation of sand in the past. The prosecution further argued that Sardar was likely to tamper with the evidence and influence the witnesses if he was released on bail.

After hearing the arguments of both parties, the Jharkhand High Court granted anticipatory bail to Sardar, subject to certain conditions. The court observed that the allegations against Sardar were not of a heinous nature and that he was entitled to the benefit of bail. The court further noted that Sardar had cooperated with the investigation and had not absconded or attempted to evade arrest. The court also took into account the fact that Sardar had no criminal antecedents and that he was a resident of the area.

The court directed Sardar to surrender or be arrested within a week and to furnish a bail bond of Rs.10,000 with two sureties of the same amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Khunti. The court also imposed certain conditions on Sardar, including that he should not leave the country without the permission of the court, that he should cooperate with the investigation, and that he should not tamper with the evidence or influence the witnesses.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court's decision to grant anticipatory bail to Bablu Sardar in connection with a case of illegal mining and transportation of sand is significant as it highlights the importance of the right to bail and the need to balance the interests of the accused and the prosecution. The court's decision also underscores the need for a fair and impartial investigation and trial in cases of alleged criminal offences.
