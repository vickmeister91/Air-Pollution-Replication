The Bombay High Court recently passed a significant order in a criminal writ petition filed by M/s Jham Builders and Developers Private Limited against the State of Maharashtra and the Sub Registrar of Documents. The petitioner was aggrieved by a direction issued by the investigating agency to not register any sale deed with regard to certain survey numbers. The petitioner contended that such a direction was beyond the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court heard the case and made the rule returnable forthwith. The court also examined Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and its provisions. The court order states that Section 91 does not empower a government agency to issue directions to produce documents, parcels, or things in the custody of postal or telegraph authorities. The power of any officer in charge of a police station is limited to issuing summons or a written order to the person in possession of the necessary documents for investigation.

The court observed that the investigating agency had issued a direction to the Sub Registrar of Documents to not register any sale deed with regard to certain survey numbers. The court held that such a direction was beyond the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court noted that the power to issue directions under Section 91 is limited to the production of documents, parcels, or things in the custody of a person other than the police.

The court also observed that the power to issue directions under Section 91 is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations. The court held that the power to issue directions under Section 91 is limited to cases where the production of documents, parcels, or things is necessary for the purposes of an investigation or a trial. The court noted that the investigating agency had not made out a case for the production of documents, parcels, or things in the present case.

The court allowed the petition and quashed the direction issued by respondent no.1 to respondent no.2. The court held that the direction was beyond the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and was therefore illegal. The court also held that the investigating agency had not made out a case for the production of documents, parcels, or things in the present case. No costs were ordered.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the limitations on the power to issue directions under the section. The court has held that the power to issue directions under Section 91 is limited to cases where the production of documents, parcels, or things is necessary for the purposes of an investigation or a trial. The court has also held that the power to issue directions under Section 91 is not absolute and is subject to certain limitations.

The court order is likely to have a significant impact on investigations and trials in criminal cases. The order clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the limitations on the power to issue directions under the section. The order is likely to prevent investigating agencies from issuing directions beyond the scope of Section 91 and ensure that the power to issue directions is exercised only in cases where it is necessary for the purposes of an investigation or a trial.

In conclusion, the Bombay High Court has passed a significant order in a criminal writ petition filed by M/s Jham Builders and Developers Private Limited against the State of Maharashtra and the Sub Registrar of Documents.
