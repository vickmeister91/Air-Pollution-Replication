The Gujarat High Court has issued a court order to protect, preserve, and improve water-bodies in the state and safeguard them against encroachments. The order was made in response to several petitions seeking direction on the government to place the water policy of Gujarat before the court, remove encroachments on various lakes and ponds, and execute work for distillation and reviving feeder streams. The court constituted a committee to suggest ways to recharge the lakes and ponds in Ahmedabad and directed the authorities to submit all necessary details to the committee. The court also ordered the government to notify water-bodies in the Gazette and ensure that they are maintained and preserved as water-bodies.

The court order instructs Local Bodies and Area Development Authorities to gradually desilt water-bodies and remove encroachments. Water-bodies must not be converted to other uses in future town planning schemes, and no debris should be dumped in them. The General Development Control Regulations provide for a minimum distance of nine meters between development zones and water-bodies. The court emphasizes the importance of preserving and maintaining water-bodies, and the neglect of authorities in doing so. The State has prepared a draft of State Water Policy and is keen to discharge its constitutional and legal duties to safeguard the lakes and ponds. The court cites various legal provisions and decisions to support the preservation of water-bodies.

The court order cites various legal precedents to support the idea that the High Court cannot exercise its inherent powers in a way that contradicts statutory provisions. The order also discusses the importance of water resources and the legal duties of the government and municipalities to protect and manage them. Provisions are outlined for the demarcation of areas surrounding lakes and ponds, and regulations are in place to prevent the fouling of water sources.

The court order outlines the legal duty of the State Government, Municipal and Panchayat authorities, the Area Development Authorities and other legal authorities to protect and improve water-bodies as a part of the environment and to ensure the supply of safe water to the public. The State is under a legal duty to protect the natural resources meant for public use, including lakes and ponds. The court directs the State Government to notify all the lakes and ponds in the territory of the State that vest in the State and/or the Area Development Authorities or the Local Bodies including Panchayats, in the Official Gazette within three months from the date of this order. The water-bodies that vest in the State or Local Bodies should not be alienated or transferred. 

The court emphasizes the need to properly preserve lakes and ponds and directs the State Government, the Area Development Authorities, and Local Authorities to take urgent measures to rejuvenate the water-bodies by undertaking a declared phased program of desiltation and make adequate provisions for recharging them by appropriate stormwater drains and other feasible means and to take measures against pollution of such water-bodies. The court directs the State Government to constitute Water Resources Council as contemplated in the Draft Water Policy of the State, headed by the Hon'ble the Chief Minister with other Ministers, including the Ministers in-charge of the Environment and Urban Development Departments to oversee the program for protection, preservation, and improvement of the water-bodies. The court also directs the State Government, the Urban Development Authorities, and the Local Bodies to exercise their statutory powers to remove the existing encroachments and take measures to prevent encroachments.

The court has ordered the State Government and all Area Development Authorities and Local Bodies to protect, maintain and preserve all the water-bodies in the State which are identified as per the development plans, town planning schemes and the Government records and which will be notified in the Official Gazette, as water-bodies and they will not be alienated or transferred or put to any use other than as water-bodies. The court has also directed the concerned authorities to prepare an authenticated record of existing encroachments and take urgent steps to remove them in accordance with law and the rehabilitation policies of the Government. The Water Resources Committee will closely monitor the removal of encroachments by the concerned authorities, and the Area Development Authorities and the Local Bodies shall furnish, quarterly, particulars of such encroachments and their removal to the Water Resources Committee. The court has also directed the concerned authorities to determine the peripheral area surrounding a lake or pond on which construction may be prohibited and once the peripheral area, around a lake or pond, in which there will be no construction allowed is determined, the same shall be notified.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of protecting and preserving water-bodies in the state of Gujarat and outlines various legal duties and provisions to ensure their proper management. The order directs the government and various authorities to take urgent measures to rejuvenate and maintain water-bodies, remove encroachments, and prevent pollution. The court also stresses the need for proper demarcation and regulation of areas surrounding water-bodies to prevent further encroachments and ensure their long-term preservation.
