The court case involves a dispute between S.S. Enterprises and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) over the termination of their contract for collecting parking charges at Ahmedabad Airport. The petitioner had won the license through a tender process and had deposited a security deposit in the form of a bank guarantee. The agreement included clauses for dispute resolution and termination in case of default or breach. However, the court order does not provide any further details on the specific grounds for termination or the outcome of the case.

In another court order, the termination of a contract between AAI and the petitioner for parking facilities at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Airport was under consideration. The termination was based on the discovery that the bank guarantee provided by the petitioner was forged. The petitioner claims to have had no knowledge of the forgery and is willing to substitute the bank guarantee. The court is considering whether the termination was justified and whether the petitioner should have been given a hearing before the termination.

The court found that the petitioner had not been given a hearing by the Department, which resulted in adverse consequences. However, the court did not base its decision on this issue. The court noted that the petitioner had provided a bank guarantee that did not exist, and therefore, the Airports Authority had the right to terminate the contract. The court also stated that the petitioner could use the dispute resolution mechanism provided in the agreement. The court dismissed the petition.

In the final court order, a petition was dismissed, and the discretion to bypass a certain mechanism was given to Ced. The judges involved were Akil Kureshi and B.N Karia.

In summary, the court cases involve disputes between AAI and various petitioners over the termination of contracts for parking facilities at airports. In the first case, the specific grounds for termination are not provided, while in the second case, the termination was based on the discovery of a forged bank guarantee. The court found that the petitioner had not been given a hearing in the second case, but ultimately dismissed the petition as the petitioner had provided a bank guarantee that did not exist. In the final case, a petition was dismissed, and the discretion to bypass a certain mechanism was given to Ced.
