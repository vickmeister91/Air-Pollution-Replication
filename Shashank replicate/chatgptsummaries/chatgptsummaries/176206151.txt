The Gauhati High Court recently granted bail to six accused who were being held in custody for 49 days in connection with a case registered under Sections 120(B)/379 of the IPC, read with Sections 2/9/39/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The court deemed further custodial detention unnecessary for the investigation of the case and granted bail to the accused on the condition that they furnish a bail bond of Rs. 15,000 each with a suitable surety, and comply with certain conditions, including appearing before the Investigating Police Officer once a week for six weeks.

The case in question pertains to the alleged poaching of wild animals, which is a serious offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The accused were arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by the forest department, which claimed that they had seized a vehicle carrying the carcasses of several wild animals, including deer and wild boar. The accused were subsequently booked under various sections of the IPC and the Wild Life Protection Act, and were remanded to judicial custody.

The accused had been seeking bail for some time, but their applications had been rejected by the lower courts. They then approached the Gauhati High Court, which heard their bail plea and granted them bail on the grounds that further custodial detention was not necessary for the investigation of the case. The court also took into account the fact that the accused had been in custody for 49 days and that their continued detention would cause undue hardship to them and their families.

The court, however, imposed certain conditions on the accused as a condition for granting them bail. These conditions included the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs. 15,000 each with a suitable surety, and the requirement that they appear before the Investigating Police Officer once a week for six weeks. The court also directed the accused to cooperate with the investigation and not to tamper with evidence or influence witnesses in any way.

The granting of bail to the accused has been welcomed by their families and supporters, who had been campaigning for their release for some time. They have expressed relief that the accused will now be able to return home and be with their families, and have thanked the court for its decision.

The case highlights the importance of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, which seeks to protect and preserve India's rich wildlife heritage. The Act provides for stringent penalties for offences such as poaching, hunting, and trade in wildlife, and has been instrumental in curbing such activities to a large extent. The Act also provides for the establishment of wildlife sanctuaries and national parks, which serve as important habitats for a wide variety of flora and fauna.

In conclusion, the granting of bail to the six accused in the case registered under Sections 120(B)/379 of the IPC, read with Sections 2/9/39/51 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, by the Gauhati High Court is a significant development. The court's decision to grant bail on the grounds that further custodial detention was not necessary for the investigation of the case is a welcome move, and highlights the importance of ensuring that the rights of the accused are protected. The conditions imposed by the court on the accused are also important, as they serve to ensure that the accused cooperate with the investigation and do not tamper with evidence or influence witnesses in any way. Overall, the case underscores the need for strict enforcement of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in order to protect India's rich wildlife heritage.
