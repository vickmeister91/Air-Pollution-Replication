The court order pertains to two separate cases involving disputes over the use and ownership of a jointly owned property. In the first case, the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendants, seeking to restrain them from raising any unauthorized construction on the ground floor of the property and from alienating or creating third-party interest therein until the disposal of the suit. The plaintiff and the defendant no.1 and 2 are co-owners of the suit property, and the defendant no.1 is in possession of the ground floor. The defendant no.1 is running a hazardous factory at the ground floor, causing pollution in the locality.

The court heard arguments from both parties and perused the record before issuing the order. After considering the evidence presented, the court found that the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case for an interim injunction. The court noted that the defendant no.1 was carrying out hazardous activities on the ground floor, which were causing pollution in the locality. The court also found that the defendant no.1 had not obtained the necessary permissions and approvals for the construction and operation of the factory.

In light of these findings, the court issued an interim injunction restraining the defendant from raising any unauthorized construction on the ground floor of the property and from alienating or creating third-party interest therein until the disposal of the suit. The court also directed the defendant to take all necessary steps to ensure that the hazardous activities being carried out on the ground floor were immediately stopped and that the pollution caused by the factory was remedied.

In the second case, the plaintiff and defendant no. 1 and 2 were in dispute over the construction of shops on the ground floor of a jointly purchased property. The plaintiff argued that defendant no. 1 was carrying out unauthorized construction and intended to sell the shops to the exclusion of the plaintiff and defendant no. 2. The plaintiff sought an interim injunction to restrain defendant no. 1 from carrying out any unauthorized construction and creating third-party interest in the property.

However, the court found that the plaintiff had not made out a prima facie case for an interim injunction. The court noted that the plaintiff had not provided any evidence to support their claim that the defendant no.1 was carrying out unauthorized construction or that they intended to sell the shops to the exclusion of the plaintiff and defendant no. 2. The court also found that the plaintiff had not shown that they would suffer irreparable harm if the interim injunction was not granted.

In light of these findings, the court dismissed the application for an interim injunction. The court noted that the plaintiff was free to pursue their claim for permanent and mandatory injunction in the suit filed against the defendants.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to two separate cases involving disputes over the use and ownership of a jointly owned property. In the first case, the court issued an interim injunction restraining the defendant from raising any unauthorized construction on the ground floor of the property and from alienating or creating third-party interest therein until the disposal of the suit. In the second case, the court dismissed the application for an interim injunction, finding that the plaintiff had not made out a prima facie case.
