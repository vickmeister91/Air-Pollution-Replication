The court also imposed certain conditions on the accused, including not making any inducement or threat to any person acquainted with the case and not involving in any other crime.

The case against the accused arose when they were found trespassing into a reserve forest in Kerala. The forest department officials who found them immediately arrested them and charged them with trespassing and other related offenses. The accused were produced before the Judicial Magistrate, who remanded them to judicial custody.

The accused then filed a bail application before the court, seeking release on bail. The court heard the arguments of both the prosecution and the defense and considered the facts and circumstances of the case. After considering all the relevant factors, the court allowed the bail application and directed the Judicial Magistrate to release the accused on a bond of Rs. 15,000 each with two solvent sureties.

The court also imposed certain conditions on the accused, which they must comply with in order to remain out on bail. The conditions include not making any inducement or threat to any person acquainted with the case and not involving in any other crime. The court also directed the accused to cooperate with the investigation and attend all court hearings.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused is based on the principle that every person is innocent until proven guilty. The court considered the fact that the accused have no previous criminal record and that they have cooperated with the investigation so far. The court also considered the fact that the accused have a right to defend themselves and that their continued detention would be prejudicial to their defense.

The court's decision to impose certain conditions on the accused is based on the principle that bail is a privilege and not a right. The court considered the fact that the accused have been charged with a serious offense and that there is a possibility that they may interfere with the investigation or commit other crimes if they are released without any conditions.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the accused and impose certain conditions on them is a balanced and fair decision. The court has considered all the relevant factors and has ensured that the accused are not prejudiced in any way. The accused must now comply with the conditions imposed on them and cooperate with the investigation to ensure that justice is served.
