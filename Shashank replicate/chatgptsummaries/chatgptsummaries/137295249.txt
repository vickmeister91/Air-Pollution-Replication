As a result, the court dismissed the petition and disposed of a related application.

The case highlights the importance of complying with environmental protection laws and obtaining the necessary clearances before undertaking any construction project. It also underscores the need for transparency and honesty in legal proceedings, as attempts to mislead the court can have serious consequences.
