The Madras High Court recently passed a significant order in a public interest litigation filed by S. Chakravarthi. The petitioner had sought a writ of mandamus to prevent the felling of trees in a forest land in Mamandur Village, Thiruttani Taluk, Thiruvallur District, Tamil Nadu. The petitioner argued that the land was notified for the formation of a forest in 1991 and that the proposed deforestation for the Periyar Memorial Samathuvapuram Scheme would violate the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court held that the land in question had extensive growth of trees and plantations and therefore came under the definition of 'forest land'. The court also noted that the respondents were bound to follow the statutory prescription contained in Section 2(ii) of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court allowed the writ petition and gave liberty to the respondents to approach the Central Government and seek appropriate permission if they still wished to pursue their scheme of construction of a Samathuvapuram in the lands in question.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a crucial piece of legislation that aims to conserve forests and regulate diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act defines 'forest land' as any land recorded as forest in the government records, and any land that is notified as forest land by the government. The Act also lays down a procedure for obtaining prior permission from the Central Government for diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes.

The Madras High Court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, and the need to protect forest land from deforestation. The court's observation that the land in question had extensive growth of trees and plantations and therefore came under the definition of 'forest land' is crucial. This observation underscores the need to protect all areas with significant tree cover, regardless of whether they are officially designated as forests or not.

The court's decision to allow the respondents to approach the Central Government and seek appropriate permission if they still wished to pursue their scheme of construction of a Samathuvapuram in the lands in question is also noteworthy. This decision highlights the importance of following due process and obtaining prior permission from the Central Government before diverting forest land for non-forestry purposes.

The Madras High Court's order is a significant step towards protecting forest land and ensuring that the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is implemented effectively. The order serves as a reminder to all stakeholders that the protection of forests is crucial for the well-being of the environment and society as a whole. It is hoped that the order will inspire other courts and authorities to take similar steps to protect forest land and promote sustainable development.
