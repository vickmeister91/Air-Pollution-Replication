The Karnataka High Court recently passed a court order in a writ petition filed by Somashekhar Reddy and others against the State of Karnataka. The petitioners had sought permission to extract murram, a non-specified minor mineral, from government land in Bellary district. However, their application was rejected by the Senior Geologist on the grounds that the land was a deemed forest and there was a proposal to notify it under the Karnataka Forest Act.

The court found that no enquiry had been made to determine whether the land was a forest or forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court observed that the Senior Geologist had rejected the application without conducting a proper enquiry and without giving any reasons for the rejection. The court also noted that the concerned authority had not followed the procedure laid down under the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1994.

The court set aside the impugned intimation and directed the concerned authority to consider the application afresh within three months. The court also directed the concerned authority to conduct a proper enquiry to determine whether the land in question was a forest or forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court further directed the concerned authority to follow the procedure laid down under the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1994.

The court also observed that the issue of the applicability of sub-Rule (1) of Rule 8-B of the Karnataka Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1994 was kept open. This means that the court did not make any decision on this issue and it will have to be decided in a future case.

The court order is significant as it emphasizes the importance of following the procedure laid down under the law while considering applications for mining leases. The court has also emphasized the need to conduct a proper enquiry to determine whether the land in question is a forest or forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This is important as the Act provides for the conservation of forests and prohibits the diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central Government.

The court order is also significant as it highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. The court has observed that the Senior Geologist had rejected the application without conducting a proper enquiry and without giving any reasons for the rejection. This is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice and the court has rightly set aside the impugned intimation.

In conclusion, the court order in the writ petition filed by Somashekhar Reddy and others against the State of Karnataka is a significant development in the field of mining law. The court has emphasized the importance of following the procedure laid down under the law while considering applications for mining leases and has highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in the decision-making process. The court has also directed the concerned authority to conduct a proper enquiry to determine whether the land in question is a forest or forest land within the meaning of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This is a welcome development as it will help in the conservation of forests and the protection of the environment.
