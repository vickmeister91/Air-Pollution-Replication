The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Shweta and another petitioner against Devvrat S/o Shri Shivdayal Patne. The petitioners were aggrieved by the order passed by the 2nd Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, Indore, which granted maintenance for petitioner no. 2 Aarush @ Rs. 5000/- per month and declined the maintenance for petitioner no. 1.

The petitioners had approached the court seeking maintenance for both of them, as they claimed to be in a live-in relationship with the respondent. They argued that they had been living together for the past few years and that the respondent had promised to marry petitioner no. 1. However, the respondent had refused to marry her and had also stopped providing financial support to both the petitioners.

The Family Court had considered the evidence presented by both parties and had come to the conclusion that there was no evidence to prove that petitioner no. 1 was in a live-in relationship with the respondent. The court had also noted that petitioner no. 1 had not produced any evidence to show that she was dependent on the respondent for her livelihood. Therefore, the court had declined to grant maintenance to petitioner no. 1.

However, the Family Court had granted maintenance to petitioner no. 2, as it had found that he was dependent on the respondent for his livelihood. The court had noted that petitioner no. 2 was a student and did not have any source of income. Therefore, the court had granted maintenance to him @ Rs. 5000/- per month.

The petitioners had challenged this order before the High Court, arguing that the Family Court had erred in declining to grant maintenance to petitioner no. 1. They had contended that the evidence on record clearly showed that petitioner no. 1 was in a live-in relationship with the respondent and that she was dependent on him for her livelihood.

The High Court, however, did not find any merit in the petitioners' contentions. The court noted that the evidence on record did not conclusively prove that petitioner no. 1 was in a live-in relationship with the respondent. The court also observed that petitioner no. 1 had not produced any evidence to show that she was dependent on the respondent for her livelihood.

Therefore, the High Court upheld the order of the Family Court, declining to grant maintenance to petitioner no. 1. The court also upheld the order granting maintenance to petitioner no. 2 @ Rs. 5000/- per month.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Smt. Shweta and another petitioner against Devvrat S/o Shri Shivdayal Patne. The petitioners had sought maintenance from the respondent, claiming to be in a live-in relationship with him. However, the Family Court had declined to grant maintenance to petitioner no. 1, as it had found no evidence to prove that she was in a live-in relationship with the respondent or that she was dependent on him for her livelihood. The court had granted maintenance to petitioner no. 2, as it had found that he was dependent on the respondent for his livelihood. The High Court had upheld the order of the Family Court, declining to grant maintenance to petitioner no. 1 and granting maintenance to petitioner no. 2 @ Rs. 5000/- per month.
