The court order in question pertains to a case where a school lecturer had approached the court to quash an order withdrawing his pay protection. The petitioner had been appointed as a Hindi Master in a government-aided school in 1980 and was later appointed as a school lecturer in 1996. The court examined the viability of applying instructions dated 15.11.2000 to the case and found that they did not apply. The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that principles of natural justice were not complied with before withdrawing the earlier order granting protection to his last drawn pay. The court held that non-compliance of the principles of natural justice would not be necessary if quashing an order passed against a citizen would result in the revival of an illegal order passed.

The court order states that it is not always necessary for a court to strike down an order simply because it was passed against the petitioner in breach of natural justice. If striking down the order would result in the restoration of an illegal order, it would be a futile exercise. The order in question was passed by an officer who lacked the competence to do so, and the petitioner's pay protection could not be accorded as there was no rule or instruction supporting it. Therefore, the petition was dismissed.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of following due process and adhering to established rules and regulations. The petitioner had argued that the principles of natural justice were not complied with before withdrawing the earlier order granting protection to his last drawn pay. However, the court held that non-compliance of the principles of natural justice would not be necessary if quashing an order passed against a citizen would result in the revival of an illegal order passed.

The court also examined the viability of applying instructions dated 15.11.2000 to the case and found that they did not apply. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the relevant rules and regulations before making any decisions or taking any actions.

Furthermore, the court's decision highlights the importance of ensuring that those who are authorized to make decisions and take actions have the necessary competence and authority to do so. In this case, the order in question was passed by an officer who lacked the competence to do so, and as a result, the petitioner's pay protection could not be accorded.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process, adhering to established rules and regulations, and ensuring that those who are authorized to make decisions and take actions have the necessary competence and authority to do so. By doing so, we can help to ensure that decisions and actions are fair, just, and in accordance with the law.
