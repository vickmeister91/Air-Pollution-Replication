The court order in question pertains to a suit for mandatory injunction and permanent injunction filed by the respondents against the petitioners and other defendants for running their Bhatties (furnaces) without necessary license/permission from the Pollution Control Board. The plaintiffs claimed that the operation of the Bhatties damaged their standing crops and made it difficult for them to live in their houses due to the smoke emanating from the Bhatties.

The lower appellate court had already restrained the defendants from running their Bhatties until the crops of the plaintiffs were harvested or until they complied with the suggestions made by the expert with regard to the construction of room and height of chimney. The court upheld this decision, stating that the lower court had correctly applied the law and the facts of the case.

The court also noted that the area had not been declared as an Air Pollution Control Area, but that did not give a license to the defendants to carry on with such an activity, which would result in smoke and fumes coming out and polluting the clean environment of the villages. The court emphasized that the right to life and health of the plaintiffs was paramount and could not be compromised for the sake of the defendants' business interests.

The defendants had argued that they had been running their Bhatties for many years and that the plaintiffs had not objected earlier. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the plaintiffs had the right to approach the court at any time if their rights were being violated.

The court also noted that the expert had suggested certain measures to reduce the pollution caused by the Bhatties, and the defendants had not complied with these suggestions. The court held that the defendants could not be allowed to continue with their activities unless they complied with the expert's suggestions.

The court's decision is significant as it upholds the right to a clean environment and the right to life and health of the citizens. It also emphasizes the importance of complying with the suggestions of experts in matters related to pollution control.

In conclusion, the court order in this case is a victory for the plaintiffs and for the environment. It sends a strong message to those who flout pollution control norms and violate the rights of citizens. The court's decision is a reminder that the right to a clean environment is a fundamental right and must be protected at all costs.
