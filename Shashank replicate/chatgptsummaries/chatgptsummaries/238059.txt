In a recent court order between H.M.T. Ltd. and M. Chandrasekhar, the issue of employment of casual workers was addressed. The court ruled that casual workers who have been employed for more than 240 days in a calendar year are entitled to the same benefits and protections as regular employees. This includes fair wages and protection against retrenchment. The court emphasized the principle of "equal pay for equal work" and stated that the employer must pay the same wages to casual workers as they do to regular employees for the same work.

The court's ruling is significant as it recognizes the rights of casual workers who are often vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination. Casual workers are typically employed on a temporary or short-term basis and do not receive the same benefits and protections as regular employees. This ruling ensures that casual workers who have been employed for a significant period of time are entitled to the same benefits and protections as regular employees.

The court's ruling also highlights the importance of equal treatment and non-discrimination in the workplace. The court noted that the employer cannot deny the basic rights of equal treatment to underprivileged or weaker sections of society. This is an important principle that ensures that all workers are treated fairly and without discrimination.

The court did not see the need for a scheme for the absorption of casual workers on a permanent basis. This means that casual workers will not automatically be absorbed into permanent positions after a certain period of time. However, the court's ruling ensures that casual workers who have been employed for more than 240 days in a calendar year are entitled to the same benefits and protections as regular employees.

It is important to note that the court did not examine the case of compassionate appointments for the loss of breadwinners. This issue was not addressed in the court's ruling and may be subject to further litigation in the future.

Overall, the court's ruling in this case is a significant step towards ensuring that casual workers are treated fairly and without discrimination. The principle of "equal pay for equal work" is an important principle that ensures that all workers are paid fairly for the work that they do. The court's ruling also highlights the importance of equal treatment and non-discrimination in the workplace. While the issue of compassionate appointments was not addressed in this case, the court's ruling sets an important precedent for future cases involving casual workers.
