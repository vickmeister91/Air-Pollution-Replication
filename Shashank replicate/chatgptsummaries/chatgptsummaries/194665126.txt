The court order in question pertains to a criminal case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The accused had filed a petition for production of certain documents, which was allowed by the trial court. The complainant then filed two petitions seeking permission to mark eight documents and recall a witness for the purpose of marking the said documents. The trial court allowed the petitions, which the accused challenged in the High Court.

The High Court, after hearing both parties, held that a photocopy of a document can be marked subject to objections and that the genuineness and veracity of the secondary evidence can be tested during cross-examination. The court also noted that the accused had not raised any objections before the trial court and had only challenged the order in the High Court. The court, therefore, closed the petitions with liberty to the accused to raise objections before the trial court.
