The case of Jamal Ikbal and Danish Jamal had been ongoing for some time, with the two men being accused of a forest crime. They had been in custody since April 29th, 2015, and had sought bail on the grounds that they were reputed citizens of the locality and had no criminal past. The court, after considering their application, found that there was no substantial evidence against the applicants and granted them bail on a bond of Rs. 30,000 each.

The court's decision to grant bail to the two men was based on the fact that there was no substantial evidence against them. This suggests that the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court's decision to grant bail is significant, as it allows the two men to be released from custody until the end of the trial.

However, the court's decision to grant bail is not unconditional. The court has directed the trial court to take the photo identity proof and residential address proof of the applicants before releasing them on bail. This is a standard procedure that is followed in such cases to ensure that the accused persons do not abscond or fail to appear in court.

The court's decision to grant bail to Jamal Ikbal and Danish Jamal is likely to be welcomed by their families and supporters. It is also likely to be seen as a victory for the rule of law, as it demonstrates that the court is willing to grant bail to accused persons who have not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to the case of Jamal Ikbal and Danish Jamal, who had been in custody since April 29th, 2015, for a forest crime. The court found that there was no substantial evidence against the applicants and granted them bail on a bond of Rs. 30,000 each. The order is effective until the end of the trial, and the trial court is directed to take the photo identity proof and residential address proof of the applicants before releasing them on bail. This decision is likely to be seen as a victory for the rule of law and a positive development for the accused persons and their families.
