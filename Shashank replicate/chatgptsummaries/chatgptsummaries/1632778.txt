The court orders discussed in this summary relate to civil revision petitions and the interpretation and application of Section 148-A of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the first case, the petitioner had filed a suit seeking specific performance of a property agreement, but had taken the plea that the property did not exist. The trial court allowed the petitioner's request for an Advocate Commissioner to inspect the property, but the respondent obtained a final order in the civil revision petition without proper notice being served to the petitioner or their counsel. The petitioner argued that this was a fraud on the court and the order should be set aside. The respondent argued that the petitioner had no locus standi in the case and that the sale agreement was binding on all parties.

The court considered various precedents and ultimately held that a caveat is a formal notice and does not create an obligation on the court to desist from making any order in the proceeding before it unless the caveat is decided. The court also held that notice to the lawyer of the caveator should be given, but if notice is given to the party instead, it cannot be considered bad in law if it has not otherwise prejudiced them. The court ultimately set aside the order allowing the civil revision petition and remanded the matter back to the trial court for further consideration.

In the second case, the court order discusses the interpretation and application of Section 148-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, which allows individuals to lodge a caveat in anticipation of a suit or proceeding. The court clarifies that the requirement to serve notice of the caveat on the expected party is only directory in nature and can be dispensed with if valid grounds are shown for non-compliance. The court also emphasizes the importance of serving copies of grounds and applications on the caveator's counsel or the caveator before filing them in the registry.

The court ultimately concludes that the passing of final orders without giving notice to the petitioner/first respondent or the respondent No. 2 to 4 is valid in the eye of the law. This decision is based on the fact that the petitioner had failed to appear before the court despite being served notice, and the respondent had made a valid application for the passing of final orders. The court also notes that the petitioner had not filed any application for setting aside the ex-parte order, and therefore, the order had attained finality.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of proper notice and service of documents in civil proceedings. While a caveat may provide some protection to a party, it does not create an obligation on the court to desist from making any order in the proceeding before it unless the caveat is decided. Additionally, the court emphasizes the importance of serving copies of grounds and applications on the caveator's counsel or the caveator before filing them in the registry. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the passing of final orders without proper notice being served to the parties involved.
