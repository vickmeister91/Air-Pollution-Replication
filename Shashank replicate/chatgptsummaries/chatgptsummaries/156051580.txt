In the first court order, a Forest Range Officer has filed a writ petition seeking the quashing of an order and a direction to restrain the respondents from conducting a departmental enquiry until the final disposal of a criminal trial. The petitioner has been charged with an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, for allegedly hunting a Black Buck. The petitioner alleges that the charges levelled by the department and in the criminal case being similar, grave prejudice would be caused to him as the witnesses are similar in both the proceedings.

The court cites the decision in Capt. M. Paul Anthony vs. Bharat Gold Mines Ltd. and another and G. M. Tank vs. State of Gujarat and others to conclude that departmental proceedings and proceedings in a criminal case can proceed simultaneously, though separately. However, if the departmental proceedings and the criminal case are based on identical and similar sets of facts and the charge in the criminal case against the delinquent employee is of a grave nature which involves complicated questions of law and fact, it would be desirable to stay the departmental proceedings till the conclusion of the criminal case.

The court order highlights the fact that departmental proceedings and criminal cases can proceed simultaneously, but only if they are based on different sets of facts and charges. If the charges in both proceedings are similar, it can cause grave prejudice to the accused, as the witnesses are likely to be the same in both proceedings. In such cases, it is desirable to stay the departmental proceedings until the conclusion of the criminal case.

In the second court order, the issue of the effect of acquittal in a criminal case on a departmental enquiry that was instituted on the same set of facts and similar charges is discussed. The court cites several cases and holds that each case must be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. The court also notes that the nature of evidence in a criminal trial is entirely different from that in a departmental enquiry.

In the case at hand, the charges in the criminal case are not available for comparison with the charges in the departmental enquiry, so it cannot be concluded that they are similar. The petition is dismissed.

The court order emphasizes the fact that each case must be considered in the backdrop of its own facts and circumstances. The nature of evidence in a criminal trial is entirely different from that in a departmental enquiry, and the charges in both proceedings must be compared to determine if they are similar. If the charges are similar, it can cause grave prejudice to the accused, and it is desirable to stay the departmental proceedings until the conclusion of the criminal case.

In conclusion, these court orders highlight the importance of considering the facts and circumstances of each case while deciding whether departmental proceedings and criminal cases can proceed simultaneously. If the charges in both proceedings are similar, it can cause grave prejudice to the accused, and it is desirable to stay the departmental proceedings until the conclusion of the criminal case. The nature of evidence in a criminal trial is entirely different from that in a departmental enquiry, and the charges in both proceedings must be compared to determine if they are similar.
