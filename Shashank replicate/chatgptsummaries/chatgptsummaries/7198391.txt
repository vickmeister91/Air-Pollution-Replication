Sawai Ram was arrested for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. He filed a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C. The court has granted him bail and directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. The court has also ordered him to appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial.

The Wild Life Protection Act is a law that aims to protect wildlife and their habitats. It prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wildlife and their products. Sawai Ram was arrested for violating this law. He filed a bail application under Section 439 Cr.P.C., which allows a person to apply for bail before the trial court or the High Court. The court has granted him bail, which means that he can be released from custody until the completion of the trial.

However, the court has imposed certain conditions on Sawai Ram's bail. He has to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each. This means that he has to provide a written promise to the court that he will appear before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. He also has to provide two people who will act as sureties, which means that they will be responsible for ensuring that Sawai Ram appears before the trial court on every date of hearing.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sawai Ram is based on several factors. One of the factors is the nature of the offence. The Wild Life Protection Act is a non-bailable offence, which means that a person accused of violating this law cannot be granted bail as a matter of right. However, the court has the discretion to grant bail if it is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence and that he will not commit any offence while on bail.

Another factor that the court considers while granting bail is the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice. In Sawai Ram's case, the court has imposed conditions on his bail to ensure that he appears before the trial court on every date of hearing. This is to prevent him from absconding and to ensure that he cooperates with the trial court.

In conclusion, the court has granted bail to Sawai Ram, who was arrested for an offence under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has directed him to execute a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with two sureties of Rs.25,000/- each for his appearance before the trial court on every date of hearing until the completion of the trial. The court's decision to grant bail is based on several factors, including the nature of the offence and the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice.
