The Supreme Court of India recently heard a group of five cases, including a civil appeal against the dismissal of a writ petition in the nature of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by M. Nizamudeen against M/s. Chemplast Sanmar Limited and others. The case involved the proposed setting up of a project for manufacturing Poly-Vinyl Chloride (PVC) at Semmankuppam village, SIPCOT Industrial Complex, Phase-II, Cuddalore District (Tamil Nadu). The MOEF granted environmental clearance to the project proposed by Chemplast on November 28, 2005, subject to strict compliance with specific and general conditions laid down therein. The court order details the conditions that were imposed on the project.

The court order discusses the environmental clearance granted to Chemplast for the construction of a revetment for setting up a MTF on specific conditions. The order also mentions the cancellation of permission granted for carrying seawater and raw materials through pipelines due to concerns of pollution and health hazards. The appellant, M. Nizamudeen, filed a PIL challenging the order passed by the Executive Engineer. The court heard arguments from both parties, including the use of hazardous substances and the demarcation of CRZ areas. The court ultimately dismissed the writ petition challenging the environmental clearance granted to Chemplast.

The court is considering whether the Uppanar river and its banks fall under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and whether the transfer of hazardous substances through pipelines is prohibited. The defendant argues that the land in question is not part of the CRZ and that the interpretation of the prohibition on hazardous substance transfer is too restrictive. The court must determine whether the pipelines require environmental clearance and whether the transfer of hazardous substances is allowed. The court cites the 1991 Notification which regulates activities in the CRZ.

The court order requires coastal states and union territories to prepare Coastal Zone Management Plans within a year, identifying and classifying CRZ areas and obtaining approval from the central government. The court also directed the central government to consider setting up State and National Coastal Management Authorities. The 1996 Plan for Tamil Nadu was approved and is final and conclusive for demarcation and classification of CRZ areas in the state. The Uppanar river and its banks where pipelines pass do not fall under CRZ III area as per the 1996 Plan, and no environmental clearance is needed for such pipelines. Chemplast did not suppress any material facts regarding the existence of the Uppanar river.

The court order discusses a case involving Chemplast Sanmar Limited and their pipeline project in the Uppanar river. The court found that the land portion of the banks of Uppanar river where the pipelines were laid did not fall under CRZ III area. The court also interpreted the exception clause in paragraph 2(ii) of the 1991 Notification to allow transfer of hazardous substances in or through port areas. The court dismissed the objections raised by the petitioners and upheld the permission granted by the MOEF for the project. The court also noted that the project had already been commissioned and dismissed the alternative solution suggested by Dr. Rajeev Dhavan. The case was dismissed and the parties were ordered to bear their own costs.

In summary, the Supreme Court of India heard a group of five cases involving Chemplast Sanmar Limited and their proposed project for manufacturing Poly-Vinyl Chloride (PVC) at Semmankuppam village, SIPCOT Industrial Complex, Phase-II, Cuddalore District (Tamil Nadu). The court discussed the environmental clearance granted to Chemplast for the construction of a revetment for setting up a MTF on specific conditions, as well as the cancellation of permission granted for carrying seawater and raw materials through pipelines due to concerns of pollution and health hazards. The court also considered whether the Uppanar river and its banks fall under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and whether the transfer of hazardous substances through pipelines is prohibited. The court ultimately found that the land portion of the banks of Uppanar river where the pipelines were laid did not fall under CRZ III area and interpreted the exception clause in paragraph 2(ii) of the 1991 Notification to allow transfer of hazardous substances in or through port areas.
