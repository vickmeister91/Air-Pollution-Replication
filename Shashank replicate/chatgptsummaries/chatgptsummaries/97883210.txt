The court order in question pertains to a case where Delhi Finance Company has filed a complaint against Resham Suri under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to bring to the notice of the court the discrepancies in the claim of the complainant. However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call for the Income Tax records at this stage of the trial.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable and punished with imprisonment or a fine or both. In this case, Delhi Finance Company had filed a complaint against Resham Suri for dishonouring a cheque.

Resham Suri, the accused, had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. Section 91 Cr.P.C deals with the production of documents and other things necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The accused had sought to bring to the notice of the court the discrepancies in the claim of the complainant by examining their Income Tax Returns.

However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call for the Income Tax records at this stage of the trial. The court held that the accused had not made out a case for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant. The court observed that the accused had not shown how the Income Tax Returns of the complainant were relevant to the case. The court also noted that the accused had not pointed out any specific discrepancies in the claim of the complainant that could be established by examining their Income Tax Returns.

The court's decision to dismiss the application is in line with the principles of criminal law. In criminal cases, the burden of proof lies on the prosecution, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The accused has the right to defend themselves and to examine the evidence presented by the prosecution. However, the accused must establish the relevance of the evidence they seek to examine and show how it is connected to the case.

In this case, the accused had failed to establish the relevance of the Income Tax Returns of the complainant and had not shown how they were connected to the case. The court, therefore, found no reason to call for the Income Tax records at this stage of the trial.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a case where Delhi Finance Company has filed a complaint against Resham Suri under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The accused had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C for summoning the Income Tax Returns of the complainant for the financial years 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 to bring to the notice of the court the discrepancies in the claim of the complainant. However, the court dismissed the application as it found no reason to call for the Income Tax records at this stage of the trial. The court's decision is in line with the principles of criminal law, which require the accused to establish the relevance of the evidence they seek to examine and show how it is connected to the case.
