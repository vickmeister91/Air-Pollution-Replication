The Madras High Court recently heard two writ petitions filed by M/s. Supreme Poultry Private Limited against the District Collector-cum-Inspector of Panchayats, Karur District, and the President of Kodanthur Village Panchayat, Aravakurichi Taluk, Karur District. The petitioner company had obtained various permissions and approvals from different authorities to establish a poultry farm and a feed manufacturing mill. However, due to the influence of a rival business group, the Karur Paramathi Panchayat Union Council had passed a resolution cancelling the permission granted to the petitioner company.

The court held that the local body is not the appropriate authority to give a final opinion on matters relating to pollution and that the impugned order is not within the jurisdiction assigned to them under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. The court also held that the impugned order passed by the first respondent, cancelling the plan/building permission granted by the second respondent, is illegal, as it is in violation of the principles of natural justice.

The court order states that the petitioner company had obtained building permission from the second respondent, but there is no legal requirement to obtain permission from the Panchayat Council. The impugned orders of the Vice-President and District Collector-cum-Inspector of Panchayats have been challenged as illegal and invalid. The petitioner company had invested a huge amount of money for setting up the poultry farm and feed manufacturing mill, and had obtained necessary consent orders from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. The impugned orders were passed without giving a reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner company and are inconsistent with the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. The establishment of the poultry farm and feed manufacturing mill would cause pollution and adversely affect the health of the general public. The Kodanthur Village Panchayat has the power and authority to refuse the grant of building plan.

The court order discusses a writ petition filed by a company seeking permission to establish a poultry farm and feed manufacturing mill in Udaiyanpalayam. The court notes that while the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board had granted its consent, the local Village Panchayat had the authority to consider the health and environmental impacts of the establishment. The court also notes that no resolution had been passed by the Kodanthur Village Panchayat approving the building plan and permission to establish the farm and mill. The court ultimately dismisses the writ petition but orders the District Collector to hold an inquiry and pass appropriate orders within eight weeks.
