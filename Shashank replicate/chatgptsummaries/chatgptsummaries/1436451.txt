The Madras High Court received 17 petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all requesting a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus. The Sri Mudaliambal Trust filed one of the petitions, asking for a writ to call for the records of the Anna University and quash an order that denied affiliation to MNSK College of Engineering. The other petitions were filed by various educational trusts and organizations, all seeking similar relief for their respective colleges. The court noted that all the petitions had identical orders and that the Anna University had declined to grant fresh affiliation for the academic year 2002-03.

The court order quashes an order by Anna University denying affiliation to the petitioner's college for the year 2002-03 due to non-compliance with various certificates and permissions, including permission under Section 37 B of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Act. The court considers whether the denial of affiliation was illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory, or vitiated by mala fides, and whether the petitioner is entitled to relief. The court also examines the mandatory provisions of Section 5 of The Land Reforms Act, which prohibit public trusts from acquiring land without prior permission, and concludes that the petitioner's acquisition of land for the purpose of establishing an engineering college is legally invalid.

The court order states that a public trust cannot compel a university to grant affiliation for an educational institution if the trust does not hold the land lawfully. The provisions of Section 5 are mandatory, and any acquisition of land without prior permission under Section 37 B of the Act is null and void. The University can insist on the production of such permission, and the petitioner cannot claim to be a legal owner without it. The Land Reforms Act is mandatory, and the acquisition of land by a public trust is prohibited without prior permission. The University is well-founded in requiring the production of permission under Section 37-B, and the petitioner cannot establish or run a college without complying with the requirements of the Act.

The court order states that the colleges established by the petitioners have the necessary infrastructure as prescribed by the AICTE and the University. The court asked the petitioners if they would be willing to hand over the institution to the State Government or University if the State declines to exempt the acquisition of land. The petitioners refused to do so. The court also held that there is no material to establish malice or ill will on the part of the Anna University. The court examined the question of whether approval of the State is required for establishing a professional college and held that the University can take the stand that the petitioner trust has no valid propriety right over the land. The court also referred to a previous case where it was held that in exceptional circumstances, the court may be constrained to exercise jurisdiction if affiliation is being withheld unreasonably or the decision is being prolonged.

The court order states that the fate of many students should not be left hanging due to unending delays in granting affiliation to their institution. The court finds that there have been minor deficiencies in the institution, but they have been substantially complied with and should not be a reason to withhold affiliation. The court directs the authorities to expedite the process of granting affiliation without delay. The plea of discrimination is not sustained as the illegality committed in passing one order cannot be a ground for perpetrating illegality. The court also notes that some of the requirements, such as getting a certificate from the Electrical Inspector and Inspector of Factories, are not applicable to these institutions.

The court order states that a license is required under the Pollution Control Act or any other related enactment. The building safety certificate is not an issue for the petitioner as the building will be used for a public college. Some of the institutions have complied with the requirements, while others have secured certificates or applied for them. The court emphasizes that the power to demand compliance of statutory regulations or other requirements will always include the power to insist on compliance of all incidental matters or matters connected with it. The court also cites previous cases to support the idea that the exercise of power must be consistent with the provisions of the Act and not violate any other statutory enactment or provision. The court answers the points raised in the case, stating that the denial of affiliation by Anna University is not illegal or arbitrary, and the demand for certain certificates is necessary, while the demand for others is not required.

The court order pertains to a case involving colleges that installed high-tension power supply without an Electrical Inspector's certificate. The court ruled partly in favor of the petitioners and partly in favor of the respondents on various points, including the acquisition of land without prior permission, denial of affiliation by Anna University, and the entitlement of relief prayed for by the petitioners. The court dismissed the writ petitions and ordered the parties to bear their respective costs. The petitioner colleges were advised to secure necessary exemption or authorization to hold the land from the State Government within four weeks, failing which the University may advise the students to seek admission in other approved and affiliated engineering colleges in the State.

In summary, the Madras High Court received 17 petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, all requesting a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus. The court order quashes an order by Anna University denying affiliation to the petitioner's college for the year 2002-03 due to non-compliance with various certificates and permissions, including permission under Section 37 B of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Act
