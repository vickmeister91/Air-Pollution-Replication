The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) appealed a judgment and order passed by the High Court of Delhi in 2009, which held that the project land was "Residential" and that the DDA was the final authority to determine land use. The court found that the development agreement between the DDA and Kenneth Builders was frustrated due to intervening circumstances not contemplated by either party. Kenneth Builders was responsible for obtaining various approvals and clearances from the appropriate authorities, including environmental agencies of the State and Central Government. The Department of Forests of the GNCTD raised objections to carrying out activities on the project land, which resulted in an exchange of letters for several months between the DDA, GNCTD, and Kenneth Builders. The court found that the project land falls within the Ridge, and no construction activity could be carried out without the consent of the Ridge Management Board and the permission of the court.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests gave environmental clearance for a residential housing project subject to the condition that Kenneth Builders obtain a "consent to establish" from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee under the Water Act and the Air Act. Kenneth Builders applied for this consent but was unable to obtain it due to a dispute over whether the project site was within the ridge area. The Delhi High Court held that Kenneth Builders was not entitled to have the tender/auction set aside but was entitled to have the DPCC examine its application for consent to establish within two months.

The court ordered the DPCC to examine Kenneth Builders' application for "consent to establish" within two months from the standpoint of the Water Act and the Air Act. If the DPCC does not grant consent and the project cannot be carried out, Kenneth Builders is entitled to a return of the entire amount paid to the DDA. The High Court held that once the Master Plan for Delhi earmarks land for a particular use, no other authority can challenge it. The MoEF had given environmental clearance, and the role of the DPCC was limited to the grant of "consent to establish" under the Air Act and the Water Act. The controversy remains whether the project land is a part of the Ridge or not. The CEC concluded that the project of the DDA involving non-forestry use of the land could be permitted only after obtaining clearance from the Ridge Management Board and after obtaining the permission of this Court.

The court order states that the use of land falling in Delhi Ridge for development projects can only be permitted after clearance from the Ridge Management Board and permission from the court. This permission is subject to a deposit of 5% of the estimated project cost for conservation and development of Delhi Ridge and compensatory afforestation. The court has previously granted permission for non-forestry use of land falling in "extended ridge areas" for two projects by Border Road Organisation and Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. The court also discusses a contractual dispute between Kenneth Builders and DDA, stating that Kenneth Builders took necessary steps to commence construction activity on the project land but due to the impasse created by governmental agencies, it could not proceed. The court cites Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, which states that an agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void, and that compensation must be made for any loss sustained through non-performance of the promise.

The court order discusses the doctrine of frustration in contract law, which states that if an unforeseen event or change of circumstances makes it impossible for a party to fulfill their contractual obligations, they are excused from further performance. The court applies this doctrine to a case involving the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Kenneth Builders, where the DDA had promised to provide land for a residential project but was unable to do so due to legal restrictions on construction in the area. The court finds that the contract was frustrated and orders the DDA to refund the deposit made by Kenneth Builders with interest. The court also discusses the concept of "as is where is" in contracts and clarifies that it pertains only to physical issues at the site, not legal restrictions on construction.

In summary, the court orders in these cases pertain to a residential housing project in Delhi that was subject to various environmental clearances and approvals. The project land falls within the Ridge, and no construction activity could be carried out without the consent of the Ridge Management Board and the permission of the court. The court also discusses a contractual dispute between the DDA and Kenneth Builders, where the contract was frustrated due to legal restrictions on construction in the area. The court orders the DPCC to examine Kenneth Builders' application for "consent to establish" within two months and orders the DDA to refund the deposit made by Kenneth Builders with interest. The court clarifies that the concept of "as is where is" in contracts pertains only to physical issues at the site, not legal restrictions on construction.
