The Jharkhand High Court recently heard two revision petitions challenging a judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh. The case involved allegations of extortion and threats made by the petitioners against the informant. The trial court found the petitioners guilty, and the appellate court upheld the conviction. The High Court heard arguments from both sides and allowed an application for intervention by Ramgarh Sponge Iron Private Limited. The court disposed of the interlocutory applications and reserved judgment on the revision petitions.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reviewed the evidence. The defense argued that the lower courts made errors in their judgments and that the charges against the defendants should be dropped due to irregularities in the investigation. The prosecution argued that the charges were valid and that the defendant's official duties did not excuse their actions. The court considered previous cases and determined that the question of whether a public servant's actions require sanction for prosecution can be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The court also outlined principles for determining whether an act is connected to official duty and whether sanction is necessary.

The court order states that the question of sanction for prosecution should be dealt with at the stage of taking cognizance but can also be raised at any stage of the proceedings. The accused has the right to lead evidence in support of their case on merits. The court must determine whether the act complained of is related to the discharge of official duty and whether there is a reasonable connection between the act and the official duty. The court cannot take cognizance of an offense committed by a public servant without the previous sanction of the government concerned, except in cases where the public servant is not removable from office.

The court order discusses the jurisdiction of the court in cases where a public servant is alleged to have committed an offense while acting in the discharge of their official duty. The court can only take cognizance of such cases if the act complained of is related to the discharge of official duty and there is a reasonable connection between the act and the official duty. The court must determine whether the act was done in the performance of duty or in excess of it. The court order cites several cases to explain the scope and meaning of Section 197 of the Code, which provides protection to public servants against vexatious criminal proceedings. The court must determine whether the act complained of was done in the performance of official duty and whether there is a reasonable connection between the act and the official duty.

The court order discusses the nature and scope of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provides protection to public servants against frivolous or false prosecution for acts committed in the discharge of their official duties. The court emphasizes that the act in question must have a reasonable connection to the official duty, and that protection is not available for acts that are not permitted under the law or are a misuse of authority. The court also notes that excessive force can never be considered a performance of duty, but the question is whether the act was done in the performance of duty or in purported performance of duty. The court concludes that in the present case, it is mandatory for the prosecution to seek sanction from the appropriate authority under Section 197 before proceeding with the case against the public servant.

The court order explains that the protection provided to public servants under Section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code only applies to acts or omissions done in the discharge of official duty. The section has to be construed strictly, but once an act or omission is found to have been committed in discharge of duty, it must be given a liberal and wide construction so far as its official nature is concerned. The court also provides examples of acts that are not within the scope of official duty, such as committing extortion. The court concludes that the alleged act of extortion committed by the public servant in this case was not related to his official duty and therefore does not qualify for protection under Section 197.

The court order discusses a case where the petitioners are accused of extortion and threatening to kill the owner of a factory. The court finds that the petitioners continued to extort money even after the matter relating to violation of pollution norms by the factory came to an end. The court also rejects the argument that the prosecution should have sought sanction for prosecution of one of the accused. The court further discusses the arguments made by both sides and ultimately concludes that the impugned judgments passed by the Trial Court and the Appellate Court do not warrant interference under the revisional jurisdiction. The court also notes the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense, including witness testimony and documentary evidence.

The court order discusses a case of extortion and threats made by the petitioners against the informant and factory owner. The court finds that the evidence presented by the prosecution, including witness testimony and documentary evidence, supports the allegations made against the petitioners. The court also addresses various arguments made by the defense, including the delay in filing the first information report and the lack of proof of mobile phone records. Ultimately, the court upholds the judgment of conviction and order of sentence against the petitioners.

In conclusion, the Jharkhand High Court heard two revision petitions challenging a judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Hazaribagh. The court considered previous cases and determined that the question of whether a public servant's actions require sanction for prosecution can be raised at any stage of the proceedings.
