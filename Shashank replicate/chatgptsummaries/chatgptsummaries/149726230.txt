The High Court in Chennai recently issued a court order pertaining to two criminal original petitions filed by Senthamizhselvi and others. The first petition challenged the order passed by the court below dismissing the petitioner's request to issue summons to the Sub Registrar to produce a sale deed. The second petition sought to quash an FIR. However, the court dismissed both petitions and directed the respondent police to complete the investigation within three months and file a final report or closure report.

Anand Venkatesh of the High Court in Chennai. The parties involved include a House Officer from the District Crime Branch in Cuddalore and the Public Prosecutor.

In the first petition, the petitioner had requested the court to issue summons to the Sub Registrar to produce a sale deed.

The High Court, however, dismissed the appeal, stating that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim.

In the second petition, the petitioner had sought to quash an FIR. However, the court dismissed the petition, stating that the petitioner had failed to provide any evidence to support their claim. The court also noted that the FIR had been registered based on a complaint filed by the petitioner's husband, who had alleged that the petitioner had cheated him out of money.

The court order directed the respondent police to complete the investigation within three months and file a final report or closure report. The court also noted that the investigation should be conducted in a fair and impartial manner, and that the police should not be influenced by any external factors.
