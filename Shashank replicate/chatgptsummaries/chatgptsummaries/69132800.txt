The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a writ petition filed by Shree Balaji Minerals and others challenging an order passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) revoking their consent to operate under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981 and directing for closure under Section 31A of the Act. The court held that the order could be challenged by filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act and, if grievances are still not remedied, by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act.

The case arose when the RSPCB issued a show-cause notice to Shree Balaji Minerals and others for non-compliance with the conditions of their consent to operate under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981. The RSPCB found that the company was operating without a valid consent to operate and was causing air pollution in the area. The RSPCB then revoked their consent to operate and directed for closure under Section 31A of the Act.

Shree Balaji Minerals and others challenged the order before the Rajasthan High Court, arguing that the RSPCB had not followed the due process of law and had not given them an opportunity to be heard before revoking their consent to operate. They also argued that the order was arbitrary and violative of their fundamental right to carry on their business.

The court, however, rejected their arguments and held that the RSPCB had followed the due process of law and had given them an opportunity to be heard before revoking their consent to operate. The court also held that the order was not arbitrary and was based on the findings of the RSPCB that the company was causing air pollution in the area.

The court further held that the order could be challenged by filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act and, if grievances are still not remedied, by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act. The court observed that the remedy of appeal was available to the petitioners and they should have availed of it instead of filing a writ petition before the High Court.

The court also observed that the National Green Tribunal had been established to deal with environmental disputes and had the expertise to deal with such matters. The court, therefore, directed the petitioners to approach the Appellate Authority and, if necessary, the National Green Tribunal for redressal of their grievances.

The decision of the Rajasthan High Court is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following due process of law and the availability of remedies under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court has also emphasized the role of the National Green Tribunal in dealing with environmental disputes and has directed the petitioners to approach the appropriate forum for redressal of their grievances.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court has dismissed a writ petition filed by Shree Balaji Minerals and others challenging an order passed by the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board revoking their consent to operate under the Air (Prevention of Pollution) Act, 1981 and directing for closure under Section 31A of the Act. The court has held that the order could be challenged by filing an appeal before the Appellate Authority under Section 31 of the Act and, if grievances are still not remedied, by filing an appeal before the National Green Tribunal under Section 31B of the Act. The court has also emphasized the importance of following due process of law and the availability of remedies under the Act, and has directed the petitioners to approach the appropriate forum for redressal of their grievances.
