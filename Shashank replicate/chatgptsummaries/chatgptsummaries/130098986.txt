The Karnataka High Court recently issued an order directing the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to consider the applications for renewal of consent for operation of a film city under the Air and Water Acts. The petitioner had challenged the closure order passed by the Board, claiming that it was passed without giving them an opportunity to be heard. The court found merit in the petitioner's argument and directed the competent authority to consider the applications afresh and pass an appropriate order within three months.

The case concerned a film city that had been operating in Karnataka for several years. The petitioner, who was the owner of the film city, had applied for renewal of consent for operation under the Air and Water Acts. However, the Board had passed a closure order, citing violations of the Acts. The petitioner had challenged the order, claiming that they had not been given an opportunity to be heard before the order was passed.

The court examined the facts of the case and found that the petitioner had indeed not been given an opportunity to be heard before the closure order was passed. The court noted that the principles of natural justice required that the petitioner be given an opportunity to present their case before any adverse order was passed against them. The court also observed that the closure order had been passed without considering the petitioner's application for renewal of consent.

The court directed the competent authority to consider the applications for renewal of consent afresh and pass an appropriate order within three months. The court also directed the petitioner to comply with the mandatory requirements under the provisions of the Water Act. The court emphasized the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, noting that they were essential for the protection of the environment and public health.

The court's order is significant as it underscores the importance of due process and the principles of natural justice in administrative decision-making. The court's decision to direct the competent authority to consider the applications afresh and pass an appropriate order within three months is also noteworthy, as it ensures that the petitioner's rights are protected and that the Board's decision is based on a proper consideration of the facts and the law.

Overall, the court's order serves as a reminder of the importance of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and the need for administrative decision-making to be fair, transparent, and based on due process. The court's decision to direct the competent authority to consider the applications afresh and pass an appropriate order within three months is a positive step towards ensuring that environmental laws are enforced effectively and that the public interest is protected.
