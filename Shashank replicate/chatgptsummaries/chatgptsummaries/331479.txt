The court order in question pertains to Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which deals with the production of documents or other items that may be necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other legal proceeding. The court notes that this provision is crucial for ensuring that all parties involved in a trial have access to the evidence they need to make their case and find the truth.

One of the key points made in the court order is that public prosecutors should not withhold documents that are requested by the defense if those documents are necessary for finding the truth in a trial. This is an important principle, as it ensures that both sides have access to the same evidence and can make their arguments based on the same facts. If a public prosecutor does withhold a document that is necessary for the defense, the court notes that the defense can move an appropriate application under Section 91 to get the person with custody or power over the document to attend the court for its production.

The court also advises that such applications should be moved before the framing of charges, as this can help to avoid inconvenience to the court and prejudice to the adversary. This is because if an application is made after the charges have been framed, it may delay the trial and cause unnecessary complications. By making the application before the charges are framed, the defense can ensure that they have access to the evidence they need without causing undue disruption to the legal process.

Overall, the court order emphasizes the importance of Section 91 in ensuring that all parties involved in a trial have access to the evidence they need to make their case. It also highlights the responsibility of public prosecutors to provide this evidence when it is requested by the defense, and the role of the court in ensuring that this process is carried out fairly and efficiently. By following these principles, the court can help to ensure that justice is served and that the truth is discovered in every trial.
