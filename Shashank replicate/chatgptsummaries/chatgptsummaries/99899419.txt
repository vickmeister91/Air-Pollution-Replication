The Supreme Court of India has recently admitted an appeal by Ratneshwar Prasad Singh against Banka Municipality and others. The appeal arises from a National Green Tribunal judgment in 2016, which dismissed Singh's claim that an open drain of Banka Municipality caused an overflow of sludge on his residential property. The Supreme Court has directed the Chief Officer of the Municipality to visit Singh's property with a team of engineers and prepare an appropriate plan of action to remedy the grievance and provide a lasting solution within two months. The appellant must cooperate with the first respondent to implement the directions. There is no order as to costs.
