In a recent court order, the petitioner, Saroj Devi, filed a petition under Section 482Cr.P.C. to set aside the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate, Karauli, which refused to release Tractor Messi DI 1035 along with Trolley to the petitioner. The tractor and trolley were seized as case property in FIR No.1/2018 registered at Police Station Mandrayal, Karauli, for the offence under Section 379 IPC and Sections 29, 50 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act.

The court allowed the petition and directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. The petitioner shall keep the vehicle intact and produce it as and when required by the trial court. The petitioner shall execute Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court. The trial court is empowered to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit.

The court order is significant as it highlights the importance of following due process of law while dealing with seized property. The court has rightly directed the trial court to release the tractor and trolley seized as case property by imposing certain conditions. This ensures that the property is not misused or damaged while it is in the custody of the petitioner.

The conditions imposed by the court are also important as they ensure that the petitioner takes full responsibility for the property and produces it as and when required by the trial court. The execution of Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and bonds by two sureties to the satisfaction of the trial court ensures that the petitioner is held accountable for any damage or loss caused to the property.

The court has also empowered the trial court to impose any other conditions in the Supurdaginama/indemnity bond and surety bonds to be furnished by the petitioner and sureties, which it may deem fit. This ensures that the trial court has the flexibility to impose additional conditions as per the specific circumstances of the case.

Overall, the court order highlights the importance of following due process of law while dealing with seized property. It also emphasizes the need for accountability and responsibility on the part of the petitioner while handling the property. The conditions imposed by the court ensure that the property is not misused or damaged while it is in the custody of the petitioner and that the petitioner takes full responsibility for the property.
