A recent court order pertains to a criminal case involving three accused who allegedly trespassed into a forest reserve with unlicensed guns and ammunition to hunt wild animals. The accused filed a petition seeking the release of their seized vehicle, mobile phones, and cash. The court dismissed the petition for the mobile phones but allowed the cash to be released to the lawful owner. The court also ordered the release of the vehicle to its registered owner subject to certain conditions, including the removal of illegal alterations made to the vehicle.

The court noted that the allegations against the accused were still in the realm of suspicion and that evidence would need to be taken to determine whether they had gone to the resort for hunting or recreational purposes. The court order states that the vehicle in question must be produced before the Assistant Wild Life Warden within two weeks of its release to verify that any illegal alterations have been removed. The release of the vehicle is subject to this verification and it cannot be used for any similar crimes. The magistrate may add additional conditions for the release of the vehicle if necessary. The petition has been disposed of.
