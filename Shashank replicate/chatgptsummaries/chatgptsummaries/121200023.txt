The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Sare Laxmaiah Naidu challenging the detention order passed by the Collector and District Magistrate, YSR District, Kadapa, to detain his son-in-law Sri Machupalli Ramanaiah @ Pottabbi under the provisions of the A.P. Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Boot Leggers, Dacoits, Drug Offenders, Goondas, Immoral Traffic Offenders and Land Grabbers Act, 1986. The detention order was passed on the grounds of the detenu's involvement in illegal Red Sander tree felling activity and smuggling the logs to secret and unknown destinations in India for their eventual transfer abroad.

The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to previous judgments to set out the principles relating to judicial review of orders of preventive detention. The court found that the detenu met the definition of a "goonda" and that the offenses were serious enough to warrant preventive detention. The court rejected the argument that the offenses could be dealt with through normal prosecution and emphasized the importance of protecting the environment and conserving forest cover.

The court also discussed the importance of considering relevant information, such as bail orders, when making a detention decision. The court stated that if one of the grounds for detention is found to be bad, the order of detention is liable to be set aside. In this case, the court found that the sponsoring authority did not place the conditional orders granting anticipatory bail before the detaining authority, which would have weighed with the detaining authority at the time of passing of detention order. Therefore, the relevant material was suppressed by not placing the same before the detaining authority, and the order of detention is liable to be set aside on this ground alone.

The court found that the detaining authority had assigned a valid and tenable reason as to why the detenu should be preventively detained. The court dismissed the writ petition without costs.
