The court order pertains to a criminal revision petition filed by IFCI Limited and its authorized representatives against an order summoning them for commission of an offense under section 175 IPC. The court found that there were no sufficient grounds to summon the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of the company and set aside the order to that extent. The court also noted that the investigating agency had requested cooperation from the company and its representatives, but their requests had fallen on deaf ears.

The case in question involves allegations of commission of an offense under section 175 IPC. The investigating agency had summoned IFCI Limited and its authorized representatives, including the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director, to appear before the court. However, IFCI Limited and its representatives filed a criminal revision petition challenging the order of summoning.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, found that there were no sufficient grounds to summon the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of the company. The court set aside the order to that extent. The court also noted that the investigating agency had requested cooperation from the company and its representatives, but their requests had fallen on deaf ears.

The court's decision to set aside the order of summoning the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director of the company is significant. It indicates that the court did not find any evidence to suggest that the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director was involved in the alleged offense. This decision is likely to have a positive impact on the reputation of the Chief Executive Officer/Managing Director and the company.

However, the court's observation that the investigating agency's requests for cooperation had fallen on deaf ears is a cause for concern. It suggests that IFCI Limited and its representatives may not have fully cooperated with the investigating agency. This could potentially have negative consequences for the company and its representatives.

The court order sets aside the summoning of one accused person for commission of an offense, but allows the summoning of two other accused persons to be first agitated before the trial court. The case is a summons triable case that can be tried summarily, and the court can hear the accused persons and even discharge them at the stage of consideration of notice of accusation. The accused company and one accused person have already extended full cooperation and have requested withdrawal of the complaint. The judgment is to be sent to the trial court, and the file related to the revision petition is to be consigned to the Record Room.
