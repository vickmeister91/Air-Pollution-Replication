The Kerala High Court issued a court order in response to a writ petition filed by two architects, Ramesh J. Tharkan and Arundhati Nayar, who were residents of Konthuruthy, Kerala. The petitioners filed the petition in the interest of the public, alleging that illegal reclamation and encroachment of Kayal lands in the adjoining Maradu Panchayat and other vantage points could lead to ecological imbalance and harm tourism. The petitioners sought directions to prohibit the illegal reclamation of land and backwaters in the Cochin city and suburbs.

The court directed the respondents to ensure that further reclamation activities are stopped and issued stringent directions to that effect. The court also noted that the reclamations were carried out by a governmental department, but there was a lack of coordination between departments and local bodies. The Revenue Divisional Officer stated that they were not authorities under the Coastal Zone Regulations and hence could not take any action on the complaint lodged.

In another case, the court order discussed the reclamation of Kayal Puramboke in Kerala, India. The Panchayat claimed they were not responsible for the reclamation, which was done for a bus terminal project. The court found that the reclamation violated coastal zone regulations and ordered a report on the amount of land required for the bus terminal. The petitioners argued that adjacent landowners had also engaged in similar activities, and the court found that the entire area reclaimed should be appropriated in the public interest. The court also noted that reclamation of kayal was prohibited in CRZ areas and that the Chief Engineer had authorized the reclamation in violation of this prohibition.

In yet another case, the court order discussed a situation where reclamation work had been authorized by the Chief Engineer, despite a prohibition on such work. The court found that while the reclamation was in contravention of regulations, demolition would not be in the public interest. However, additional reclamations made by private individuals were condemned as against public interest, and the authorities were instructed to take possession of the reclaimed properties and appropriately deal with them. The court emphasized the need to monitor and prevent unauthorized constructions, encroachments, or reclamations.

Overall, the court orders issued by the Kerala High Court highlight the importance of adhering to coastal zone regulations and preventing unauthorized reclamations, encroachments, and constructions. The court emphasized the need for coordination between departments and local bodies to ensure that such activities are prevented and appropriate action is taken against those who violate regulations. The court also emphasized the need to appropriate reclaimed land in the public interest and prevent ecological imbalances that could harm tourism and the environment.
