The Delhi High Court has issued a series of directions to address the high levels of pollution in the city. The court order pertains to a case filed by M.C. Mehta against the Union of India and others regarding the high levels of pollution in Delhi. The court had issued certain directions in October 2015 to mitigate the pollution levels, including the imposition of an ECC on vehicles entering Delhi and the diversion of commercial traffic to alternative routes. However, the pollution levels continued to remain high, and the court has now directed that vehicles not bound for Delhi should be diverted to alternative routes and not allowed to enter Delhi. The court has also banned the registration of new private and commercial light duty diesel vehicles in Delhi until March 2016 and directed that all taxis, including those operated by aggregators like OLA and UBER, should move to C.N.G. fuel by March 2016. The court has also directed the Government of NCT of Delhi to vacuum clean the roads to reduce pollution levels.

The court has directed the Government of NCT of Delhi to repair pavements, make new pavements, and purchase vacuum cleaning vehicles to reduce pollution levels caused by dust rising from roads and pavements. The court also directs the Union of India and State Governments to enforce C.P.C.B. rules and norms against construction activities to prevent further pollution. The court further directs local bodies and institutions to refrain from burning solid waste and to dispose of it in a scientific manner. The toll collector's request for modification of the order is adjourned to January 5, 2016.

The court's directions are aimed at reducing the high levels of pollution in Delhi, which have been a cause of concern for several years. The city has been ranked as one of the most polluted cities in the world, with high levels of particulate matter and other pollutants in the air. The pollution levels have been linked to a range of health problems, including respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and cancer.

The court's directions are expected to have a significant impact on the city's pollution levels. The ban on the registration of new diesel vehicles is likely to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, while the move to C.N.G. fuel for taxis is expected to reduce emissions from the transportation sector. The diversion of vehicles not bound for Delhi to alternative routes is also expected to reduce congestion and pollution levels in the city.

The court's directions on the repair and maintenance of pavements and the purchase of vacuum cleaning vehicles are aimed at reducing the amount of dust rising from roads and pavements, which is a major contributor to the city's pollution levels. The court's directions on the enforcement of rules and norms against construction activities and the disposal of solid waste are also expected to have a significant impact on the city's pollution levels.

The court's directions have been welcomed by environmental activists and public health experts, who have been calling for action to address the city's pollution crisis. However, some have raised concerns about the impact of the court's directions on the city's economy and the livelihoods of those who depend on diesel vehicles for their livelihoods.

Overall, the court's directions are a significant step towards addressing the high levels of pollution in Delhi. The city's pollution crisis is a complex problem that requires a range of solutions, including measures to reduce emissions from vehicles, industry, and other sources, as well as measures to improve public transportation, promote cycling and walking, and reduce waste. The court's directions are an important contribution to these efforts and are likely to have a significant impact on the city's pollution levels in the coming months and years.
