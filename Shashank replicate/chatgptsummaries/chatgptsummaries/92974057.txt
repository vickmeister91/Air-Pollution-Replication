The Supreme Court of India recently heard the case of Birendra Singh vs Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change. The case pertained to the issue of "Deemed forest" and the criteria and standards for determining it under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The National Green Tribunal had previously disposed of the matter, but the Supreme Court found that two important things were yet to be done.

The court ordered that the National Green Tribunal should not have stated that the matter stands disposed of, as the criteria and standards for determining "Deemed forest" had not been finalized. The court directed the Ministry of Environment Forest to take immediate steps to finalize the criteria and standards for determining "Deemed forest" within two weeks and report back to the court. The appeal is set to come up on May 7th, 2019.

The issue of "Deemed forest" has been a contentious one in India for many years. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. However, the Act did not define what constituted a forest. This led to a situation where many areas that were not officially designated as forests were still considered to be forests in practice. These areas were referred to as "Deemed forests."

The lack of a clear definition of "Deemed forest" led to confusion and disputes over the use of such areas. The issue was further complicated by the fact that many of these areas were inhabited by tribal communities who relied on them for their livelihoods. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was amended in 1992 to include a definition of "forest," but the issue of "Deemed forest" remained unresolved.

In 1996, the Supreme Court of India issued a landmark judgment in the case of T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad vs Union of India. The court held that all areas that were forests in practice, irrespective of their legal status, would be treated as forests for the purposes of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This meant that even areas that were not officially designated as forests could not be diverted for non-forestry purposes without the approval of the central government.

However, the issue of "Deemed forest" continued to be a source of confusion and litigation. In 2011, the Ministry of Environment and Forests issued guidelines for identifying and notifying "Deemed forests." The guidelines were meant to provide clarity on the issue and prevent disputes over the use of such areas. However, the guidelines were criticized by environmentalists and tribal groups for being too lenient and allowing for the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes.

The recent Supreme Court order in the case of Birendra Singh vs Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change is significant because it directs the Ministry of Environment Forest to finalize the criteria and standards for determining "Deemed forest" within two weeks. This is expected to provide much-needed clarity on the issue and prevent disputes over the use of such areas.

The order is also significant because it highlights the importance of protecting forests and the rights of tribal communities who depend on them for their livelihoods. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes, but it also recognizes the importance of protecting forests for their ecological, environmental, and social benefits. The Act provides for the involvement of local communities in the management of forests and the protection of their rights.

The issue of "Deemed forest" is not just a legal or technical one, but also a social and environmental one. The protection of forests is essential for the survival of many species of plants and animals, as well as for the regulation of the climate and the provision of clean air and water. Forests also provide livelihoods for millions of people, especially tribal communities who have lived in and depended on forests for generations.

In conclusion, the recent Supreme Court order in the case of Birendra Singh vs Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change is a significant step towards resolving the issue of "Deemed forest" in India. The order directs the Ministry of Environment Forest to finalize the criteria and standards for determining "Deemed forest" within two weeks, which is expected to provide much-needed clarity on the issue and prevent disputes over the use of such areas. The order also highlights the importance of protecting forests and the rights of tribal communities who depend on them for their livelihoods.
