The court order pertains to a dispute over dead rent for 100 acres of river bed land for the period 25.12.1992 to February 2001. The original petitioner was granted a mining lease in 1966 for manual picking of floated pebbles and shingles from the bed of river Pandui within the area of Village Bhiknathori in the District of West Champaran on the Indo Nepal Border. The lease was renewed from time to time and at last lease expired on 24.12.1992. The original petitioner applied for fresh lease in the month of January, 1993 for 205 Acres =81 Hectares of river bed for the aforesaid purposes. The court heard arguments from both parties and will issue a ruling.

The court order refers to various letters, reports, and notices related to the possession and leasing of 205 acres of land for mining purposes. The petitioner disputes the state's claim of an extra portion of land and the amount demanded as dead rent. The court refers to Section 9A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which deals with dead rent and royalty in respect to mining leases. Dead rent is a fixed return to the lessor based on the area leased, while royalty varies with the quantity of minerals extracted. The court cites a Supreme Court judgment to explain the difference between dead rent and royalty.

The court order discusses the power of state governments to make rules for regulating the grant of mining leases, including the consideration payable by the lessee to the lessor in the form of rent and royalty. The court cites previous judgments to support the idea that dead rent is a fixed rent always related to the leased area. The petitioner in this case was given 105 acres of land but the state government claimed to be in possession of an extra 100 acres, which the petitioner disputed. The court found that the dead rent cannot be more than what is the area given on lease and quashed the impugned order.
