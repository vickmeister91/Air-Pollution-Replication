In a recent court order, the counsel for the applicant requested more time to file copies of documents that were requested by the trial court during a hearing under section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.). The case was listed to be heard again after a week.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. empowers a court to issue a summons or order to a person to produce any document or thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section also provides that the court may direct that the person producing the document or thing be examined on oath.

In this case, it appears that the trial court had issued a summons or order under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. to the applicant, requesting the production of certain documents. However, the applicant's counsel was unable to file copies of these documents within the time frame given by the trial court.

As a result, the counsel requested more time to file the copies of the documents. The court order does not provide any further details about the nature of the documents or the reasons why the counsel was unable to file them within the given time frame.

The court order also does not indicate whether the trial court granted the request for more time or whether any further action was taken in the case. It simply states that the case was listed to be heard again after a week.

It is not uncommon for parties in a legal proceeding to request more time to file documents or to comply with court orders. However, it is important for parties to be diligent in their efforts to comply with court orders and to provide a valid reason for any delay or non-compliance.

Failure to comply with a court order can result in serious consequences, including fines, penalties, and even imprisonment in some cases. Therefore, it is important for parties to seek legal advice and assistance if they are unable to comply with a court order or if they have any questions or concerns about their legal rights and obligations.

In conclusion, the recent court order in this case indicates that the counsel for the applicant requested more time to file copies of documents that were requested by the trial court under section 91 of the Cr.P.C. The case was listed to be heard again after a week, but the court order does not provide any further details about the nature of the documents or the reasons for the delay. It is important for parties in a legal proceeding to comply with court orders and to seek legal advice if they have any questions or concerns about their legal rights and obligations.
