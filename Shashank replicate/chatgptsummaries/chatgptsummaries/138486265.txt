Three court orders have been summarized, each pertaining to a dispute over land use in India. The first case involves a property where the plaintiffs had established a stone crusher unit, but the defendants obstructed the passage. The defendants argued that the property was vested with the Government of Kerala and that the suit was not maintainable. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the appellate court agreed with the findings of the trial court. The court order discusses the provisions of various enactments touching the controversy and the contentions raised by the parties.

The second case discusses a dispute over land that is proposed to be constituted as a reserve forest. The appellants are seeking access to the land for their crusher unit, but the land has been deemed ecologically fragile and vested in the government under the Act of 2003. The court considers various statutes and argues that the appellants cannot claim a right to use the land for non-forest purposes. The court also notes that the ultimate decision in the case will depend on the outcome of appeals related to the Act of 2003. The court ultimately denies the appellants' request for access to the land.

The third court order states that the State Government cannot permit any non-forest activity in forest land without prior approval from the Central Government. The land in question cannot be used for crushing activity or bringing in granite boulders without violating this law. The court also notes that there are disputes regarding the identity of the property and that the appellants are not entitled to any relief in this appeal. The court dismisses the appeal and all pending interlocutory applications.

In the first case, the plaintiffs claimed right, title, and possession over a property where they had established a stone crusher unit. The defendants obstructed the passage, and the plaintiffs approached the Sub Divisional Magistrate, who directed the defendants to remove the obstructions. However, the defendants argued that the property was vested with the Government of Kerala and that the suit was not maintainable. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the appellate court agreed with the findings of the trial court.

The court order discusses the provisions of various enactments touching the controversy and the contentions raised by the parties. The court notes that the plaintiffs had not produced any document to show that they had acquired any right, title, or interest in the property. The court also observes that the plaintiffs had not obtained any permission from the competent authority to establish the stone crusher unit. The court concludes that the plaintiffs had no right to establish the stone crusher unit on the property, and the defendants were entitled to obstruct the passage.

In the second case, the dispute is over land that is proposed to be constituted as a reserve forest. The appellants are seeking access to the land for their crusher unit, but the land has been deemed ecologically fragile and vested in the government under the Act of 2003.

In the third case, the court order states that the State Government cannot permit any non-forest activity in forest land without prior approval from the Central Government. The land in question cannot be used for crushing activity or bringing in granite boulders without violating this law.
