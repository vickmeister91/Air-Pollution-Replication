The court order in question pertains to a criminal petition filed by Mahadev Shekaji Mane against M/S Shriram Investments Ltd. The petitioner had sought to quash an order rejecting his application to direct the complainant to produce a Hire Purchase Agreement document. The court heard arguments from both sides and ultimately ruled that the trial court's rejection of the application did not amount to a denial of fair trial.

The petitioner had argued that the Hire Purchase Agreement document was crucial to his defense, as it would have shown that he had made payments towards the vehicle in question. However, the trial court had rejected his application on the grounds that the document was not relevant to the case.

The court noted that the trial court had the discretion to allow or reject an application for the production of documents, and that its decision could only be interfered with if it was shown to be arbitrary or perverse. In this case, the court found that the trial court's decision was not arbitrary or perverse, and that it had not resulted in a denial of fair trial.

The court also observed that it had the power to make necessary orders to give effect to any order under the Code of Criminal Procedure. This meant that if the petitioner could show that the Hire Purchase Agreement document was crucial to his defense, he could still seek its production at a later stage of the trial.

Overall, the court's ruling was a reminder that trial courts have wide discretion in the conduct of criminal trials, and that their decisions should not be interfered with lightly. At the same time, the court's observation about its power to make necessary orders was a signal that it would not hesitate to intervene if necessary to ensure a fair trial.
