The court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482Cr.P.C. to challenge an order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota. The order directed the Chief Engineer (Headquarter R.E.), Central Organization Railway Electrification No.1 to produce the salary certificate of the petitioner in proceedings initiated by the respondent/wife under Section 125 Cr.P.C. The petitioner had challenged the order on the grounds that it was passed without jurisdiction and was therefore illegal and void.

The court, however, dismissed the petition, stating that the order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota was necessary for the adjudication of the proceedings and suffered from no infirmity. The court observed that the Family Court had the power to direct the production of documents and that the order was passed in the exercise of that power. The court further noted that the petitioner had not challenged the jurisdiction of the Family Court to pass the order and had only challenged the order on the grounds that it was illegal and void.

The court also observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under Section 482Cr.P.C. The court noted that the power under Section 482Cr.P.C. was to be exercised sparingly and only in cases where there was a clear abuse of the process of the court or where the ends of justice required such interference. The court held that the present case did not fall within either of these categories and that the order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota was therefore valid and legal.

The court also noted that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available to him under the law. The court observed that the petitioner could challenge the order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota by way of an appeal or revision before the appropriate forum. The court held that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy and that he could not seek the exercise of the court's inherent powers under Section 482Cr.P.C. in the present case.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to a petition filed under Section 482Cr.P.C. to challenge an order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota. The court dismissed the petition, stating that the order passed by the Family Court No.1, Kota was necessary for the adjudication of the proceedings and suffered from no infirmity. The court also held that the petitioner had not made out a case for interference under Section 482Cr.P.C. and that he had an alternative remedy available to him under the law.
