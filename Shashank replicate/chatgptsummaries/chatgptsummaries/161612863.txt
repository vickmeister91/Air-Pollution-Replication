The court order pertains to a criminal case against Rajeev Kumar, an Executive Engineer, who has been summoned to face trial for an offence under Section 37 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The complaint alleges that the Hot Mix Plant established by the Road Construction Department did not have proper pollution control equipment and was located in violation of the minimum distance requirement from habitation and railway line. The petitioner claims that he had no role in the establishment of the plant and had taken steps to obtain a No Objection Certificate from the Board and directed for the plant's closure upon inspection.

The court finds that the petitioner cannot be held responsible for the establishment of the plant and that the exoneration of the petitioner in a departmental proceeding would be of no consequence in the present complaint. The court notes that the petitioner had joined the division after the plant was operational and therefore, cannot be held responsible for the installation of a plant without prior permission of the Board. The court also observes that exoneration in a departmental proceeding may be taken into consideration in a criminal case.

The court concludes that no mens rea can be attributed to the petitioner and that the prosecution of the petitioner in the complaint case would be an abuse of process of the court. The impugned order is set aside.
