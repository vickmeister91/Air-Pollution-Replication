The Haryana State Pollution Control Board had filed a case against Shakuntala Saharan and others for carrying out illegal construction in Aravali Retreat, Raisina, Gurgaon without obtaining the necessary permissions. However, the respondents were acquitted by the court on the grounds that the Aravali Notification was only applicable to the land that was classified as Gair Mumkin Pahar in the land and revenue records maintained by the State Government on the date of the Notification.

The case was heard by the court, and after considering the evidence presented by both parties, the court found that the respondents had indeed carried out construction activities without obtaining the necessary permissions. However, the court also noted that the Aravali Notification, which was issued by the State Government, was only applicable to the land that was classified as Gair Mumkin Pahar in the land and revenue records maintained by the State Government on the date of the Notification.

The court observed that the land in question was not classified as Gair Mumkin Pahar in the land and revenue records maintained by the State Government on the date of the Notification. Therefore, the court held that the Aravali Notification was not applicable to the land in question, and the respondents could not be prosecuted for carrying out construction activities without obtaining the necessary permissions.

The Haryana State Pollution Control Board appealed against the decision of the court, but the appeal was declined, and the case was dismissed. The court held that the decision of the lower court was based on sound legal principles and that there was no reason to overturn it.

The case highlights the importance of complying with the relevant laws and regulations while carrying out construction activities. It also underscores the need for clarity in the laws and regulations governing construction activities to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

In conclusion, the court's decision in the case of Haryana State Pollution Control Board vs. Shakuntala Saharan and others highlights the importance of complying with the relevant laws and regulations while carrying out construction activities. The case also underscores the need for clarity in the laws and regulations governing construction activities to avoid confusion and ambiguity.
