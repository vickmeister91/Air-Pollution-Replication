In 1918, a court order was issued regarding a mortgage suit brought against six individuals who had executed a mortgage deed in 1900. The court found that execution was proved against four of the male executants, but not against the two female executants. The mortgaged property consisted of shares in three villages, a dwelling house, and a grove.

The court ordered the sale of an 8-anna share of the judgment debtors in a single village, as well as the dwelling house and grove. However, the court found that the sale of an entire 8-anna share was not valid and should only be for 3/5ths of the share. The court also addressed questions regarding the validity of registration and the proportion of the share to be sold.

The court also considered whether the two female executants had given authority for the mortgage deed to be executed on their behalf. The court found that their execution was not satisfactorily proved, despite conflicting evidence. Ultimately, the court agreed with the lower court's decision.

The court expressed concern about the shameless confession of forgery made by one of the witnesses and suggested prosecution for the offense. This highlights the importance of ensuring the validity of legal documents and the consequences of fraudulent behavior.

Overall, this court order emphasizes the importance of proper execution and registration of legal documents, as well as the need for thorough investigation and evidence in legal proceedings.
