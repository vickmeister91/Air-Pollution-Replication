In a recent court order, four accused persons were granted bail in a case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The case pertained to the sharing of meat from a wild boar that had accidentally fallen into a well and died. The accused were alleged to have committed an offence under the Act by consuming the meat.

The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had hunted the animal and that their custodial interrogation was not necessary. The court also noted that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had no prior criminal record. Taking these factors into consideration, the court granted bail to the accused on certain conditions.

The conditions of bail included cooperation with the investigation, not committing any similar offence while on bail, and appearing before the court as and when required. The court also directed the accused to furnish a personal bond and surety bond for the amount specified by the court.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was based on several factors. Firstly, the court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had hunted the animal. The court noted that the animal had accidentally fallen into a well and died, and that the accused had merely consumed the meat. Secondly, the court found that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had no prior criminal record. This indicated that the accused were not a flight risk and were unlikely to tamper with evidence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was also based on the principle of presumption of innocence. This principle holds that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The court noted that the accused had not been convicted of any offence and that they were entitled to the presumption of innocence.

The court's decision to grant bail to the accused was not without conditions. The court imposed certain conditions on the accused to ensure that they cooperated with the investigation and did not commit any similar offence while on bail. The court also directed the accused to furnish a personal bond and surety bond for the amount specified by the court. These conditions were imposed to ensure that the accused appeared before the court as and when required and did not abscond.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the accused in the case registered under the Wild Life Protection Act was based on several factors. The court found that there was no evidence to suggest that the accused had hunted the animal and that their custodial interrogation was not necessary. The court also noted that the accused had cooperated with the investigation and had no prior criminal record.
