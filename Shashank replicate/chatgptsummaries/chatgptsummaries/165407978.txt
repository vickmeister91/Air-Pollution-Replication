The case at hand involves allegations of hunting and killing a wild goat, which is a violation of the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution has accused the petitioner of being the main accused responsible for the killing, while the petitioner has claimed to have been falsely implicated. In such cases, the court must consider the evidence presented by both sides and make a decision based on the merits of the case.

In this case, the court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner, which means that he will not be arrested by the police in connection with this case.

This is an important condition, as it ensures that the petitioner will not obstruct the investigation in any way.

Furthermore, the court has made it clear that the petitioner is liable for cancellation of bail in case of any new case. This means that if the petitioner is accused of any other offence while he is out on bail, his bail may be cancelled. This is a standard condition in bail orders, as it ensures that the petitioner does not commit any further offences while he is out on bail.

The court has also directed the petitioner to join the investigation immediately. This is an important direction, as it ensures that the investigation is not delayed in any way. The petitioner must cooperate fully with the investigating agency and provide any information or evidence that may be required.

Finally, the court has ordered that the petitioner will be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs. 30,000/- with surety. This is a standard requirement in bail orders, as it ensures that the petitioner has a financial stake in complying with the conditions of bail.

In conclusion, the court order in question pertains to an application for bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for offences registered under the Wild Life Protection Act. The court has granted anticipatory bail to the petitioner with certain conditions, including the requirement that he cooperates fully with the investigating agency and is liable for cancellation of bail in case of any new case.
