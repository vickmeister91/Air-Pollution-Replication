The court order pertains to a civil writ petition filed by Gram Panchayat challenging two notifications imposing restrictions on the use of land denotified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act. The court had earlier decided to wait for the final view of the Supreme Court in a related case before proceeding with the petition. The Supreme Court has since delivered its judgment, stating that whether a land is a forest land or not would depend on the land records and that the land has to be recorded as forest land as on 25.10.1980 irrespective of its classification or ownership. The court has directed the State Government to identify such land as forest land as per the revenue record, which may take some time.

The court order has significant implications for the use of land denotified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act. The Act was enacted in 1900 to preserve the forests in the state of Punjab. Under the Act, certain areas were declared as protected forests, and restrictions were imposed on the use of land in these areas. However, over the years, many of these areas were denotified, and the restrictions on the use of land were lifted. This led to a situation where the land was being used for non-forest purposes, such as agriculture and construction.

The court order clarifies that even if the land was denotified under the Act, it would still be considered forest land if it was recorded as such on 25.10.1980. This means that the restrictions on the use of land under the Act would continue to apply to such land. The court has directed the State Government to identify such land as forest land as per the revenue record. This is likely to take some time, as the revenue records are not always up to date.

The court order also states that the notifications under the PLPA would only apply to forest land, and there needs to be a segregation of land between forest and non-forest land. The State Government is responsible for identifying forest land based on parameters laid down by the Supreme Court. If the land in question is not forest land, appropriate development works should be undertaken.

The court has given a deadline for implementing directions for unauthorized construction and garbage clearance. The petition has been disposed of, and compliance will be reviewed on 11.07.2014. This means that the State Government has to take action to implement the court's directions within the given deadline. Failure to do so could result in further legal action.

Overall, the court order has significant implications for the use of land denotified under the Punjab Land Preservation Act. It clarifies that even if the land was denotified, it would still be considered forest land if it was recorded as such on 25.10.1980. This means that the restrictions on the use of land under the Act would continue to apply to such land. The State Government has been directed to identify such land as forest land as per the revenue record, which may take some time. The court has also directed the State Government to segregate forest land from non-forest land and take appropriate action based on the classification. The court has given a deadline for implementing directions for unauthorized construction and garbage clearance, and compliance will be reviewed on 11.07.2014.
