The court order pertains to an application for anticipatory bail filed by T.R. Jayesh under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Jayesh is accused of offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The prosecution has alleged that Jayesh played an active role in the offence and that granting anticipatory bail would hamper the proper investigation of the case.

The court, after considering the arguments put forth by both parties, dismissed the bail application. The court observed that the allegations against Jayesh were serious in nature and that there was prima facie evidence to suggest his involvement in the offence. The court also noted that the investigation was at a crucial stage and that granting anticipatory bail would impede the progress of the investigation.

The court further observed that the grant of anticipatory bail was a discretionary power and that it should be exercised judiciously. The court noted that the purpose of anticipatory bail was to protect a person from arrest in a false or frivolous case, and not to shield a person from the consequences of his actions. The court also noted that the grant of anticipatory bail should not be used as a tool to circumvent the normal legal process.

The court also considered the argument put forth by Jayesh that he was not involved in the offence and that he was being falsely implicated. The court observed that the veracity of this claim could only be determined after a thorough investigation and trial. The court noted that the grant of anticipatory bail would not be appropriate in this case as it would prejudice the investigation and trial.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the bail application filed by T.R. Jayesh under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court observed that the allegations against Jayesh were serious in nature and that there was prima facie evidence to suggest his involvement in the offence.
