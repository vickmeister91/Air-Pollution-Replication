The recent court orders pertain to three separate cases, all of which were dismissed due to non-prosecution by the applicants. The first case involves two interlocutory applications filed in the case of T.N. Godavarman vs Union of India and others. The first application was filed by the Public Works Department, Delhi Government seeking permission to fell 17 trees for the construction of a foot-over bridge across Anuvrat Marg near Qutab Minar Metro Station, Mehrauli, South Delhi. The Central Empowered Committee (CEC) has given a report recommending the project proposal subject to certain conditions, which have been accepted and should be implemented. The second application was for directions regarding permission for the collection of felled trees by the State of West Bengal. The matter was heard and disposed of by the court.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a Writ Petition (Civil) No. 202/1995 filed by T.N. Godavaraman Thirumulpad against Union of India and others. The court heard the case on April 12, 2018, and several lawyers were present on behalf of both the petitioner and the respondents. However, in three separate interlocutory applications, no one was present on behalf of the applicants, and the applications were dismissed for non-prosecution.

The third case involves an interlocutory application for impleadment, directions, and exemption from filing O.T. regarding permission to cut bamboo by Aditya Katoch. The application was dismissed due to non-prosecution by the applicant.

However, in three separate interlocutory applications, no one was present on behalf of the applicants, and the applications were dismissed for non-prosecution. It is unclear what the interlocutory applications were for, as the court order does not provide any details.

In the third case, the court dismissed an interlocutory application for impleadment, directions, and exemption from filing O.T. regarding permission to cut bamboo by Aditya Katoch due to non-prosecution by the applicant. Again, it is unclear what the application was for, as the court order does not provide any details.

Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of being present and actively prosecuting one's case in court. Failure to do so can result in the dismissal of one's case or application, as seen in these three cases. It is also important for applicants to provide clear and detailed information about their applications, as the court order does not provide much information about the interlocutory applications in the second and third cases.
