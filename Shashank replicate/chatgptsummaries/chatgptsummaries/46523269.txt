The court order pertains to two separate petitions filed by agriculturists and the State of Punjab seeking the quashing of an order passed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that restrained the felling and cutting of trees in the entire state of Punjab. The petitioners claimed that the order was passed without taking into account the projects that had been cleared officially and had the requisite sanctions.

The first petition filed by agriculturists sought a direction to the State of Punjab to complete the rehabilitation work of the Banur Canal System before the monsoon and further commencement of sowing 'kharif' crop and also direct it to release the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. The court observed that the rehabilitation of the Banur Canal System is an important issue for supplying irrigation water to the farmers whose lands are commanded for irrigation from the Banur Canal System. The court also noted that the work of construction and widening of the Banur Canal System is being undertaken and that uncontrolled water would cause floods in the entire area if the work is not completed in a time-bound manner.

The second petition filed by the State of Punjab had obtained all necessary permissions for felling trees in connection with various ongoing projects, but the learned Tribunal had issued a blanket ban on cutting of forest trees. The State of Punjab had filed an appeal against the order in the Supreme Court, which suspended the impugned order for a period of four months to enable the State Government to execute the ongoing project mentioned above and also the other projects which are likely to be affected by the impugned order. The learned Tribunal was left with the liberty to pass any fresh order for the project in question upon consideration of the facts which are furnished by the parties.

The court noted that the NGT's order had caused a lot of inconvenience to the State of Punjab and its people. The court also observed that the NGT's order was passed without considering the projects that had been cleared officially and had the requisite sanctions. The court further noted that the State of Punjab had obtained all necessary permissions for felling trees in connection with various ongoing projects.

The court directed the State of Punjab to complete the rehabilitation work of the Banur Canal System before the monsoon and further commencement of sowing 'kharif' crop and also direct it to release the water to the fields for irrigation purposes. The court also directed the State of Punjab to submit a report on the progress of the rehabilitation work of the Banur Canal System to the NGT.

The court further directed the NGT to consider the projects that had been cleared officially and had the requisite sanctions before passing any order on the cutting of trees in the state of Punjab. The court also directed the NGT to pass any fresh order for the project in question upon consideration of the facts which are furnished by the parties.

In conclusion, the court order provides relief to the State of Punjab and its people by directing the completion of the rehabilitation work of the Banur Canal System and allowing the felling of trees for ongoing projects that have been cleared officially and have the requisite sanctions. The court also directs the NGT to consider the projects that have been cleared officially and have the requisite sanctions before passing any order on the cutting of trees in the state of Punjab.
