The court order pertains to an eviction petition filed by a landlord against a tenant for non-payment of rent. The landlord, who is a widow facing financial difficulties, wants to resume her milk dairy business in the tenanted shop. The tenant, on the other hand, has filed an application for leave to defend, claiming to have paid rent regularly and that the landlord has other sources of income. 

The court has stated that the tenant must disclose material and substantial facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order. The court has also noted that the landlord must satisfy the conditions of ownership, bonafide requirement, and non-availability of other suitable accommodation to obtain an eviction order. The court has not yet made a final decision on the matter.

In a subsequent court order, the respondent's application for leave to defend has been dismissed, and an eviction order has been granted in favor of the petitioner. The petitioner, who is a widow with financial difficulties, wants to resume her family milk dairy business in the tenanted shop. The respondent has failed to provide clear and definite facts to support his challenge of the petitioner's bonafide requirement for the shop. 

The respondent has been directed to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the shop to the petitioner, but the petitioner cannot obtain possession before six months from the date of the order. No costs are awarded, and the file is consigned to the record room.

The court has emphasized that the tenant must disclose material and substantial facts that would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an eviction order. This means that the tenant must provide evidence to support their claim that they have paid rent regularly and that the landlord has other sources of income. The court has also noted that the landlord must satisfy the conditions of ownership, bonafide requirement, and non-availability of other suitable accommodation to obtain an eviction order. 

The condition of ownership means that the landlord must be the legal owner of the property. The bonafide requirement condition means that the landlord must have a genuine need for the property. The non-availability of other suitable accommodation condition means that the landlord must not have any other property that can serve the same purpose as the tenanted shop.

In the subsequent court order, the respondent's application for leave to defend has been dismissed, and an eviction order has been granted in favor of the petitioner. The petitioner, who is a widow facing financial difficulties, wants to resume her family milk dairy business in the tenanted shop. The respondent has failed to provide clear and definite facts to support their challenge of the petitioner's bonafide requirement for the shop. 

The court has directed the respondent to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the shop to the petitioner. However, the petitioner cannot obtain possession before six months from the date of the order. This is to provide the respondent with sufficient time to vacate the premises and find alternative accommodation.

No costs have been awarded in this case, which means that neither party has been ordered to pay the other party's legal fees. The file has been consigned to the record room, which means that the case has been closed, and the court will not entertain any further applications or petitions related to this matter.

In conclusion, the court has emphasized the importance of disclosing material and substantial facts in eviction cases. The landlord must satisfy the conditions of ownership, bonafide requirement, and non-availability of other suitable accommodation to obtain an eviction order. The respondent's failure to provide clear and definite facts to support their challenge of the petitioner's bonafide requirement has resulted in an eviction order being granted in favor of the petitioner. The respondent has been directed to hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the shop to the petitioner, but the petitioner cannot obtain possession before six months from the date of the order. No costs have been awarded, and the file has been consigned to the record room.
