The court recently granted bail to two petitioners who had filed bail applications under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. The case against them was registered at Police Station Basaidang, Dholpur for offences under Sections 143, 353, 332, 336, 379, 186, 307, 427, 394 of I.P.C. and Section 29/51 of WildLife (Protection) Act. The court allowed the bail applications considering the contentions put forth by counsel for the petitioners and directed that the accused petitioners shall be released on bail provided they furnish a personal bond and sureties to the satisfaction of the learned trial court.

The petitioners had been charged with a range of offences, including rioting, assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, endangering life or personal safety of others, theft, obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions, attempt to murder, mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees, and committing an offence against a wild animal or bird. The charges were serious and carried significant penalties, including imprisonment for life in some cases.

However, the court was convinced by the arguments put forth by the counsel for the petitioners and granted them bail. The court noted that the petitioners had been in custody for a considerable period of time and that the investigation in the case had been completed. The court also took into account the fact that the petitioners had no previous criminal record and that they were not likely to abscond or tamper with evidence.

The court directed that the petitioners be released on bail provided they furnish a personal bond and sureties to the satisfaction of the learned trial court. This means that the petitioners will have to provide a sum of money as security and also produce two sureties who will guarantee their appearance in court. The amount of the bond and the sureties will be determined by the trial court.

The decision of the court to grant bail to the petitioners is significant as it highlights the importance of the right to bail in the criminal justice system. Bail is a legal right that is available to all accused persons, subject to certain conditions. The purpose of bail is to ensure that the accused person appears in court for trial and does not abscond or tamper with evidence. It is not a punishment and should not be used as a means of keeping an accused person in custody indefinitely.

The court's decision also underscores the importance of the role of the defence counsel in the criminal justice system. The counsel for the petitioners was able to convince the court that their clients were entitled to bail and that they were not a flight risk or a danger to society. This highlights the need for competent and effective legal representation for all accused persons, regardless of the nature of the charges against them.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to the two petitioners in this case is a positive development in the criminal justice system. It reaffirms the importance of the right to bail and the role of the defence counsel in ensuring that this right is protected. It also serves as a reminder that bail should not be used as a means of punishing accused persons or keeping them in custody indefinitely.
