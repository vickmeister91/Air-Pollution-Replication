The court order pertains to nine appeals made by different stone crushing businesses in Haryana, challenging the legality of an order passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in 2012. The businesses argue that they had obtained necessary permissions and had not violated any guidelines. The court examines the facts of each case and ultimately dismisses the appeals, upholding the HSPCB's order.

In one of the appeals, the appellant claims that frivolous suits were filed against their stone crusher in 2007, but were withdrawn before the High Court. In 2012, a show cause notice was issued by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) stating that the unit was running in violation of the notification dated 18th December, 1997 and the consent had been granted under a misconception of facts. The appellant submitted a reply denying any violation, but the HSPCB issued another show cause notice stating that the consent application was incomplete. The HSPCB ultimately refused to grant consent for the year 2011-12. The appellant claims that the HSPCB did not properly consider their replies and passed the order without proper application of mind.

The court order pertains to the refusal of consent for the year 2011-12 under Section 21/22 of Air (Prevention And Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 to M/s. Jai Mata Di Stone Crusher, Doiwala, Yamuna Nagar. The order states that the unit failed to comply with various provisions of the Air Act 1981 and the sitting parameters of the Notification dated 18.12.1997. The order was challenged by the appellant, but the appellate authority upheld the order. The order lists three violations committed by the stone-crusher owners, and the appellate authority concurred with the findings of the HSPCB. The court emphasizes that human health must prevail over private business interests.

The court order states that stone crushers emit harmful dust and noise that can cause respiratory diseases and hearing impairment in workers and nearby residents. The court also notes that the stone crushers violate protective measures and anti-pollution devices required by law. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting human health over private business interests. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and limitations of the National Green Tribunal Act in relation to appeals being barred by time.

The court order states that the Tribunal cannot be given the power to condone delays beyond 90 days as it goes against the legislative intent and language of the Section. The judgment of the Supreme Court in the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board Vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission case is cited to support this. The court also discusses the interpretation of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the Central Excise Act, 1944, and how they exclude the operation of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. The court concludes that even if a special law does not expressly exclude the provisions of the Limitation Act, the court can examine whether the nature of the provisions or the subject matter and scheme of the special law exclude their operation.

The court order discusses the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws and concludes that the provisions of the Limitation Act cannot be invoked if they conflict with the special law's provisions. The court also emphasizes that the use of negative language in a provision indicates that it is mandatory and cannot be overridden by equitable principles. The court dismisses several appeals on the grounds of limitation and states that the parties must bear their own costs.

One of the court orders simply lists the names of four individuals, including a justice and three expert members, and the date and location of January 9, 2014 in New Delhi. The number "30" is also included, but without context it is unclear what it refers to. No information is provided about the content or purpose of the court order.

Overall, the court orders primarily deal with the issue of stone crushing businesses in Haryana violating pollution control laws and regulations. The court emphasizes the importance of protecting human health over private business interests and upholds the orders passed by the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The court also discusses the jurisdiction and limitations of the National Green Tribunal Act and the applicability of the Limitation Act in special laws.
