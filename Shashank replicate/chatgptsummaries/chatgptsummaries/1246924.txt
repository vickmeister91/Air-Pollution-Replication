The case in question involved a petitioner who sought a writ of certiorari to quash an order rejecting their request to run a unit for manufacturing kattha and grant a license under the Uttar Pradesh Establishment and Regulation of Saw Mills Rules, 1978. The petitioner argued that they were not liable to obtain a license as they did not use timber in their final product. However, it was found that the petitioner's unit was covered by the definition of "Saw Mill" as it used a cutting machine for cutting khair-wood and required a proper license from the competent authority under the rules.

The court examined the relevant provisions of the Uttar Pradesh Establishment and Regulation of Saw Mills Rules, 1978, and noted that the definition of "Saw Mill" included any premises where timber is sawn or cut with a machine. The court also observed that the petitioner's unit used a cutting machine for cutting khair-wood, which fell within the ambit of the definition of "Saw Mill". Therefore, the petitioner was required to obtain a license under the rules.

The petitioner contended that their unit was not covered by the definition of "Saw Mill" as they did not use timber in their final product. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that the definition of "Saw Mill" was not limited to the use of timber in the final product. The court held that the use of a cutting machine for cutting khair-wood was sufficient to bring the petitioner's unit within the definition of "Saw Mill".

The court also noted that the State Government had the power to exempt certain industrial units from the operation of the rules. However, the petitioner had not shown that their unit was exempted. Therefore, the court held that the petitioner was required to obtain a license under the rules.

In light of the above, the court dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner seeking to quash the order rejecting their request to run a unit for manufacturing kattha and grant a license under the Uttar Pradesh Establishment and Regulation of Saw Mills Rules, 1978. The court held that the petitioner's unit was covered by the definition of "Saw Mill" and required a proper license from the competent authority under the rules.
