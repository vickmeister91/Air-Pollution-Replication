The Kerala High Court recently delivered a judgment on August 17, 2020, in response to two writ petitions filed by Toms College of Engineering and ICCS College of Engineering and Management against APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University and other respondents. The petitions were filed by the educational institutions seeking affiliation from the university, which was denied on the grounds that they did not fulfill the conditions set by the university. The court order discusses the arguments put forth by both the petitioners and the university, including the conditions for granting affiliation and the role of AICTE and NBA accreditation.

The court order establishes the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to regulate and maintain standards in technical education throughout India. The AICTE has created regulations that require approval from the AICTE and affiliating universities for existing technical institutions to conduct, increase, or reduce intake in courses or programs. The regulations also require NBA accreditation for new courses or expansion of existing courses, with a maximum of four divisions. The court clarifies that NBA accreditation is necessary for both new and additional courses, and there is an upper limit for maximum intake.

The court order discusses the provisions in the APH regarding the maximum intake and number of courses allowed in technical institutions. It states that NBA accreditation is mandatory for new and additional courses, and there is an upper limit for the maximum intake. The order also explains the procedures for institutions with approved intake equal to or exceeding the maximum intake allowed to increase their intake or add courses without NBA accreditation. The order concludes that NBA accreditation is necessary except where it is specifically excluded, and additional documents must be submitted for approval of increase in intake or additional courses.

The court order discusses the documents required for institutions to submit for approval of new courses or additional courses. It mentions the need for an affidavit, valid NBA accreditation certificate, and a no objection certificate from the affiliating university. The court also discusses the difference between a program and a course and the conditions that institutions without NBA accreditation must fulfill. It concludes that the University has not transgressed into the area occupied by the central enactment and that objections should have been communicated to the AICTE within the time permitted under the regulations.

The court order discusses arguments made regarding objections to the University or State Government communicating with the AICTE on receipt of its application within the time permitted under the Regulations. The court found that there is no provision for the State Government and University to submit their views in the case of any other application. The court also discussed previous judgments and the need for transparency in the procedure. The court directed the University to publish the norms at least by issuing it in the form of an order, making all those concerned aware of it. The court also directed the University to examine whether insisting on a pass percentage of 50 for the whole institution would be more onerous than insisting on NBA accreditation in one course. The court also noted a recommendation that no additional seats are approved in traditional engineering areas.

The court order sets aside a government order and requires the university to reconsider its decision on affiliation of new/additional courses/programs, taking into account the recommendation in Annexure I and clause 7 of Annexure 14 of the Approval Process Handbook, as well as the clarification letter issued by the AICTE on 26.02.2020. The court also orders the university to inform applicants of the reasons for rejection and to grant affiliation if the only reason for denial is the lack of an NOC from the government. The court also orders the university to pass orders on applications submitted for NOC on merits and issue NOC if there is no legal impediment.

The court order includes exhibits and annexures related to the approval and scrutiny of an aeronautical engineering course by the AICTE and a university. It also includes exhibits submitted by the petitioner college for affiliation and approval for the academic years 2019-20 and 2020-21. The exhibits include copies of orders, reports, calendars, and approvals issued by different authorities. The respondents also submitted copies of lists, allotments, and communications related to the college's accreditation and approval process.

In summary, the court order discusses the issue of affiliation for colleges offering technical education courses and the conditions for granting affiliation, including the role of AICTE and NBA accreditation. The court clarifies that NBA accreditation is necessary for both new and additional courses, and there is an upper limit for maximum intake. The court also discusses the documents required for institutions to submit for approval of new courses or additional courses and the need for transparency in the procedure. The court orders the university to reconsider its decision on affiliation of new/additional courses/programs and to inform applicants of the reasons for rejection. The court also includes exhibits and annexures related to the approval and scrutiny of an aeronautical engineering course by the AICTE and a university.
