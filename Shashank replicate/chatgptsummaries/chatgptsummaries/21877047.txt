The Gujarat High Court recently received an application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash and set aside an impugned complaint filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against Labhuben Keshavlal Vadaliya and others for an alleged offense under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The petitioners argued that they cannot be held liable for the alleged offense as they were not partners of the firm on the date of inspection. The respondents opposed the application, stating that the matter should be decided in trial and not quashed.

The court examined the impugned complaint and found that there were no specific allegations against the petitioners, and therefore, the complaint amounted to harassment. The court quashed the complaint as prayed for. The court order states that the petitioners have been accused in a complaint as partners of accused No.1-Firm, but there are no specific allegations that they were involved in the day-to-day affairs and management of the firm. The complaint also indicates that a criminal case was lodged against the firm, but it has been disposed of and the accused were acquitted.

The court cites various judgments to establish that for vicarious liability to be established, specific roles and responsibilities must be attributed to the accused, which is not the case here. Therefore, the petitioners cannot be held criminally liable. The court order states that the petitioners cannot be held criminally liable for the day-to-day affairs of the firm as they were not partners at the time of the inspection. The court also mentions that the original accused firm and its partners have already been acquitted. Therefore, continuing criminal proceedings against the petitioners would be unnecessary harassment and an abuse of process of law. The court quashes the impugned complaint against the petitioners.
