The court order pertains to the issue of illegal mining in the state of Goa and the legal actions taken against the offenders. The court provides a brief history of mining in Goa, including the granting of mining concessions by the Portuguese government and subsequent legislation by the Indian government. The Justice Shah Commission was appointed to investigate illegal mining and submitted an interim report. The Goa Foundation filed a writ petition as a public interest litigation seeking termination of mining leases for those involved in illegal mining activities. The foundation also requested prosecution of those who committed offenses under various laws and were involved in pilferage of state revenue.

The court has suspended all mining operations in identified leases until further notice and appointed a monitoring committee to oversee the verification of inventory, e-auction, and deposit of sale proceeds. The court has also constituted an expert committee to conduct a macro EIA study on the ceiling of annual excavation of iron ore from the state of Goa. The court has examined the legal and environmental issues raised in the report of the Justice Shah Commission and considered granting the reliefs prayed for in the writ petitions filed by the Goa Foundation and the mining lessees. The court has also examined whether the leases held by the mining lessees have expired and found that the applications of several mining leases for renewal were not disposed of within the stipulated time, making these leases void and having no effect. However, the court cannot direct prosecution of the mining lessees on the basis of the findings in the report of the Justice Shah Commission without giving them the opportunity to be heard and to produce evidence in their defense.

The court order also pertains to the conversion of mining concessions into mining leases under the Mines and Minerals Act. The order states that every mining concession listed in the First Schedule shall be deemed abolished and converted into a mining lease under the Act. The same applies to concessions listed in the Second Schedule, with effect from the date specified in the corresponding entry. The order also provides for correction of errors in the schedules. It further states that the concession holder shall become the holder of the mining lease subject to certain conditions, and the lease can be renewed on certain terms and conditions. The order also discusses the renewal of mining leases and the extension of their period. The court clarifies that most of the mining leases in which the State Government has not passed orders are deemed to have been extended under sub-rule (9) of Rule 24A of the MC Rules. The court also addresses the argument that the mining leases may have expired, but it concludes that the leases can be renewed for a maximum period of twenty years under the amended MMDR Act.

The court order also pertains to the renewal of mining leases in Goa and the dumping of mining waste outside the leased area. The court ruled that the deemed mining leases of the lessees in Goa expired on 22.11.1987, and the maximum renewal period of 20 years expired on 22.11.2007. The lessees are not entitled to operate the lease beyond 21.11.2007. The court also stated that dumping of mining waste outside the leased area constitutes mining operations and requires clearance under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The lessees have used areas outside the mining lease for clearing the dump, which is permissible under the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988, and the MC Rules.

The court order discusses the Mineral Conservation and Development Rules, 1988 and the MC Rules, specifically referring to Rule 16 of the MCD Rules and Rule 64C of the MC Rules. The court concludes that dumping of mining waste outside the leased area is not permissible under the MMDR Act and the Rules made thereunder. The court also states that dumping of mining waste on private land requires prior clearance from the Central Government under the notification issued under sub-rule (3) of Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The court also mentions that areas within 10 kms from the boundaries of National Parks and Sanctuaries are eco-fragile zones and mining is not permissible in those areas.

The court order requires the Prime Minister to notify areas within 10 km of National Parks and Sanctuaries as eco-fragile zones under the Environment (Protection) Act. The Justice Shah Commission found that this has not been done, but mining activities have been allowed in these areas. The CEC suggests that all environmental clearances for mining leases located up to 10 km from the boundaries of National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries should be kept in abeyance and considered by the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife. The State of Goa has recommended that an area up to 1 km from the boundaries of National Parks/Wildlife Sanctuaries should be treated as safety zones, but mining activity should be prohibited in a phased manner in 5 to 10 years. The court has the power to direct the State to prohibit mining activities in an area adjacent to a National Park or Wildlife Sanctuary for the purpose of protecting the flora, fauna, and wildlife habitat.

The court order states that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees a healthy life for people living in Goa, and the state can be directed not to grant mining leases or allow mining that violates this right. The court has not prohibited mining activities within 10 kilometers of the boundaries of National Parks or Wildlife Sanctuaries, but the Central Government has the power to prohibit or
