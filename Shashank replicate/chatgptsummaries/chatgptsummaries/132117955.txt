The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) filed a complaint against M/s A-One Automobile for operating without obtaining requisite consent and discharging untreated trade effluent. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution examined witnesses and evidence, but the accused denied all allegations. The court considered relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and ultimately acquitted the accused.

In another court order, the accused was alleged to have violated the Water Act and Supreme Court order. The defense argued that the accused was falsely implicated and that there was no evidence to prove the existence of effluent. However, the court found that the inspection report and closure order proved the irregularities and violations, and the accused did not deny his signature on these documents. The defense also argued that no sample was taken, but the court found that it was not necessary to collect a sample to determine the existence of untreated effluent. The defense further argued that the testimony of prosecution witnesses was unreliable, but the court found that minor contradictions were expected due to the passage of time. The court also addressed a legal issue raised by the defense regarding the competency of the person who filed the complaint, and ultimately dismissed the complaint and acquitted the accused.

The court order involves a case between DPCC and M/s A-One Automobiles, but no further information is provided.

The first court order pertains to a complaint filed by the DPCC against M/s A-One Automobile for operating without obtaining requisite consent and discharging untreated trade effluent. The accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution examined witnesses and evidence, but the accused denied all allegations. The court considered relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and ultimately acquitted the accused.

The second court order involves allegations against the accused for violating the Water Act and Supreme Court order. The defense argued that the accused was falsely implicated and that there was no evidence to prove the existence of effluent. However, the court found that the inspection report and closure order proved the irregularities and violations, and the accused did not deny his signature on these documents. The defense also argued that no sample was taken, but the court found that it was not necessary to collect a sample to determine the existence of untreated effluent. The defense further argued that the testimony of prosecution witnesses was unreliable, but the court found that minor contradictions were expected due to the passage of time. The court also addressed a legal issue raised by the defense regarding the competency of the person who filed the complaint, and ultimately dismissed the complaint and acquitted the accused.

The two court orders seem to be related to the same case involving M/s A-One Automobiles and the DPCC. However, the details provided in the orders are not sufficient to establish a clear connection between the two. It is possible that the first court order pertains to a different complaint filed by the DPCC against the accused, while the second court order pertains to the same complaint as the first one.

In the first court order, the DPCC had filed a complaint against M/s A-One Automobile for operating without obtaining requisite consent and discharging untreated trade effluent. The accused had pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution had examined witnesses and evidence, but the accused had denied all allegations. The court had considered relevant provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and ultimately acquitted the accused.

In the second court order, the accused was alleged to have violated the Water Act and Supreme Court order. The defense had argued that the accused was falsely implicated and that there was no evidence to prove the existence of effluent. However, the court had found that the inspection report and closure order proved the irregularities and violations, and the accused did not deny his signature on these documents. The defense had also argued that no sample was taken, but the court had found that it was not necessary to collect a sample to determine the existence of untreated effluent. The defense had further argued that the testimony of prosecution witnesses was unreliable, but the court had found that minor contradictions were expected due to the passage of time. The court had also addressed a legal issue raised by the defense regarding the competency of the person who filed the complaint, and ultimately dismissed the complaint and acquitted the accused.

It is unclear whether the two court orders pertain to the same case or different cases involving M/s A-One Automobiles and the DPCC. However, it is evident that the accused had been acquitted in both cases. The first court order had focused on the lack of evidence to prove the allegations against the accused, while the second court order had addressed various legal and factual issues raised by the defense. Overall, the court orders highlight the importance of complying with environmental regulations and the need for proper evidence to establish violations.
