The court order in question pertains to the case of Sirajuddin and Mohammad Zahoor, who had been in custody since May 12, 2015, for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants had sought bail on the grounds that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case was not so grave. However, the Public Prosecutor informed the court that the applicants had killed one. After considering the arguments and circumstances of the case, the court allowed the application for bail and directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on given dates. The order would be effective till the end of the trial but would become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The case of Sirajuddin and Mohammad Zahoor had been ongoing since May 12, 2015, when they were taken into custody for offences under the Wild Life Protection Act. The applicants had been seeking bail on the grounds that they were reputed citizens with no criminal past and that the case was not so grave. However, the Public Prosecutor informed the court that the applicants had killed one, which made the case more serious.

After considering the arguments and circumstances of the case, the court allowed the application for bail. The court directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on given dates. The order would be effective till the end of the trial but would become ineffective in case of bail jump.

The court's decision to grant bail to Sirajuddin and Mohammad Zahoor was based on several factors. Firstly, the court considered the fact that the applicants were reputed citizens with no criminal past. This was an important factor in the court's decision, as it indicated that the applicants were not likely to flee or pose a threat to society if released on bail.

Secondly, the court considered the nature of the offence. While the applicants had been charged with offences under the Wild Life Protection Act, the court did not consider the case to be so grave as to warrant denying bail. This was likely due to the fact that the applicants had no criminal past and were reputed citizens.

Finally, the court considered the arguments put forward by the Public Prosecutor. While the fact that the applicants had killed one was a serious matter, the court did not consider it to be sufficient grounds to deny bail. Instead, the court directed the applicants to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount to appear before the trial court on given dates.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to Sirajuddin and Mohammad Zahoor was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. While the applicants had been charged with serious offences, the court did not consider them to be so grave as to warrant denying bail. Instead, the court directed the applicants to appear before the trial court on given dates and to furnish a bond of Rs. 30,000 each with one surety bond of the same amount. The order would be effective till the end of the trial but would become ineffective in case of bail jump.
