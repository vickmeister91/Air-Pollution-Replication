Two court orders were discussed in the given text. The first order pertains to a petition seeking a direction to stop excavation of earth from a civic amenity area marked in red ink in Annexure-A to the petition. The petitioner argued that the installation of a sewerage treatment plant in the civic amenity site would result in health hazards to the residents of the locality. The respondents argued that the sewerage water from all the three layouts is discharged into the open tank abutting the civic amenity site in question, and as a result, the tank water is contaminated. The court held that the use of a portion of the civic amenity site in question for installation of a sewerage treatment plant does not contravene the definition of the expression 'civic amenity' as provided in the Act. The court also held that the location of the sewerage treatment plant in the civic amenity site in question is not hazardous to public health.

The second court order discusses a complaint about a mosquito nuisance caused by a sewerage treatment plant being constructed near a residential area. The court examined the area and found that the treatment plant would improve environmental conditions and suggested measures to prevent mosquito larvae. The court also noted that similar treatment plants are located near residential areas and that the plant would be maintained by the housing society until it is handed over to the Bangalore Development Authority. The court dismissed the petitioner's claims that the plant should be located further away and concluded that granting the relief sought by the petitioner would be hazardous to public health. The writ petition was dismissed.

The court also held that the location of the sewerage treatment plant in the civic amenity site in question is not hazardous to public health.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the installation of a sewerage treatment plant in a civic amenity site does not contravene the definition of the expression 'civic amenity' as provided in the Act. The court also noted that the location of the sewerage treatment plant in the civic amenity site in question is not hazardous to public health. The court's decision was based on the fact that the tank water is already contaminated due to the discharge of sewerage water from all the three layouts into the open tank abutting the civic amenity site in question. Therefore, the installation of a sewerage treatment plant in the civic amenity site would not cause any additional harm to public health.

In the second court order, the court discussed a complaint about a mosquito nuisance caused by a sewerage treatment plant being constructed near a residential area.
