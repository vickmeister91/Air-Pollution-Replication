In two separate court orders, the Madras High Court has directed the State of Tamil Nadu and the District Collector of Vellore District to refund the lease amount and security deposit paid by M/s. Saketh India Ltd. for quarry land. The petitioner had filed a writ petition seeking a declaration that the lease amount and security deposit paid for the quarry land was illegal and demanded a refund with interest.

In the first court order, the court found that possession of the land was not handed over to the petitioner and that the land was classified as unreserved forest land, for which prior permission from the Central Government was required. As the petitioner was unable to carry out quarrying operations due to the lack of permission, the court ordered the respondents to refund the amount paid by the petitioner. The court also rejected the respondents' argument that the petitioner approached the court belatedly for the refund.

The second court order stated that the petitioner had paid a large sum of money to the respondent for quarrying operations but had not been given possession of the land. The petitioner had requested a refund but had not received it, leading to the filing of a writ petition. The court found that the petitioner was entitled to a refund of the amount paid and that the respondent could not legally claim dead rent or area assessment. The court also rejected the respondent's argument that a writ petition could not be maintained while an application for repayment was pending. The court ordered the respondent to refund the lease amount within 12 weeks.

These court orders highlight the importance of following legal procedures and obtaining necessary permissions before carrying out any operations on land. The court has made it clear that possession of land is a crucial factor in determining the legality of any transaction related to it. In both cases, the petitioner had paid a significant amount of money for the quarry land but had not been given possession of it, which led to the court ordering a refund.

The court's rejection of the respondents' arguments that the petitioner had approached the court belatedly and that a writ petition could not be maintained while an application for repayment was pending, shows that the court is committed to ensuring that justice is served and that legal procedures are followed.

The court's order that the respondent cannot legally claim dead rent or area assessment is also significant as it clarifies that such claims are not valid in cases where possession of land has not been given to the petitioner.

Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder to individuals and companies to ensure that they follow legal procedures and obtain necessary permissions before carrying out any operations on land. It also highlights the importance of possessing land before entering into any transaction related to it. The court's commitment to ensuring justice and following legal procedures is evident in its rejection of the respondents' arguments and its order for a refund of the lease amount.
