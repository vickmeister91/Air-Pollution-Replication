The Punjab-Haryana High Court recently heard a case in which M/s A-One Mega Mart P.Limited and others challenged the orders of HDFC Bank declining their application to sell mortgaged property under Section 13(13) of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. The petitioner-company had defaulted on their loan and proposed to sell the mortgaged properties to pay back the bank. The bank granted permission for the sale but withdrew the one-time settlement scheme when the petitioner-company failed to pay the remaining amount. The court heard arguments from both sides and raised preliminary objections, but ultimately did not provide a clear ruling on the case.

The court order discusses the maintainability of a writ petition against a bank and examines relevant statutes and precedents. It notes that the Reserve Bank of India is a statutory authority with supervisory power over scheduled banks, and that the Banking Regulation Act empowers the Reserve Bank to issue directions in the interest of banking policy. The court considers whether the petitioners have a right to redeem the property by discharging the entire amount payable to the bank, and whether they have acted in good faith.

The court order specifies that a banking company must provide notices and communications to the Reserve Bank, appoint officers to observe the company's affairs, and make necessary changes to management. The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 facilitates speedy recovery of dues and establishes special machinery for this purpose. The SARFAESI Act of 2002 contains detailed mechanisms for enforcing security interest, including steps for secured creditors to take and modes of recovery.

The court order discusses various provisions of Section 13 of the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. It outlines restrictions on the sale or transfer of secured assets, the rights of multiple secured creditors, and the distribution of sale proceeds in the case of a company in liquidation. It also discusses the remedies available to borrowers who have grievances against the actions taken by secured creditors and the role of the Tribunal in enforcing the provisions of the Act.

The court order discusses various sections of the SARFAESI Act and DRT Act, including the powers of the Tribunal and Appellate Tribunal, the time limit for disposal of applications, and the jurisdiction of civil courts. The court also refers to previous judgments by the Supreme Court and High Courts regarding the maintainability of writ petitions against any person or authority on whom a statutory duty is imposed. The court emphasizes that technicalities should not come in the way of granting relief under Article 226 of the Constitution.

The court order discusses the scope of exercise of writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India by the High Court. It notes that this jurisdiction is very wide and can be used to correct administrative decisions and issue writs for enforcement of rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose. However, it is emphasized that this is a public law remedy and is only available against a body or person performing a public law function. The order also discusses the difference between public law and private law remedies and concludes that the facts of each case decide the point. The court order also summarizes previous cases that have discussed the scope of Article 226, including the powers of the High Courts and the types of writs that can be issued.

The court order states that High Courts have the power to issue writs, orders, and directions to enforce fundamental rights or for any other purpose. This power is not limited to the enforcement of fundamental rights like the power under Article 32. The words "any person or authority" used in Article 226 do not mean only State or statutory authorities, but also cover any person or body performing a public duty. Institutions providing medical education perform a public duty and are subject to the restrictions contained in Part III of the Constitution. Private schools or colleges are not subject to this principle. The court also states that writs can be issued against private persons for enforcement of duties and obligations imposed upon them by statute. The court further explains that High Courts can issue writs, orders, or directions to "any person" for enforcement of any fundamental right or "for any other purpose" even where the State may not be directly involved in the dispute but the issue is of a public duty or performance of public function by a private body.

The court order discusses the issue of whether a body, public or private, is amenable to writ jurisdiction or not. The court concludes that the "function" test is the correct one to test maintainability. If a public duty or public function is involved, any body, public or private, would be subject to judicial scrutiny under the extraordinary writ jurisdiction of article 226. The court also notes that funding is not an issue and a privately funded private organization but discharging a public duty would still be within the "net" of article 226. The court further states that the BCCI cannot be said to be beyond the sweep of article 226 in all eventualities for all times to come.

The court order states that a writ may not be issued if there is no non-compliance or violation of any statutory provision by a private body. However, if a scheduled bank takes recourse to the provisions of SARFAESI Act, it shall be amenable to writ jurisdiction of the court. The case in question involves a rejected OTS proposal by the bank, which the court finds to be
