The court order pertains to two separate cases where petitioners were allotted land for cultivation, but it was later found to be part of forest land. In the first case, the forest department issued a notice restraining the petitioners from entering the land. The court found that the land was indeed part of forest land and the allotment was in breach of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court also examined the challenge made by the petitioners against the revised allotment of land and found that the revision was legal. However, the court directed the state government to make the land cultivable and hand over possession within a period of one month. The court also directed the state government to refund the amount paid by the petitioners with reasonable interest.

In the second case, the court ordered that the concerned officer of the State Government should comply with the statement made by the Ld.Addl.AG regarding the possession of land at village Piprana. The possession should be handed over within a month from the date on which the lands are made cultivable. If any petitioner who has paid the amount is not allotted the land, then the amount paid by them or their legal representatives shall be refunded with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. within three months from the date of receipt of writ of this court. The rule in each petition is discharged and there shall be no order as to costs.

In both cases, the court found that the land allotted to the petitioners was part of forest land and therefore the allotment was in breach of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court also directed the state government to make the land cultivable and hand over possession within a period of one month. Additionally, the court ordered the state government to refund the amount paid by the petitioners with reasonable interest.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is a central legislation that regulates diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act requires that any diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes should be approved by the central government. The Act also requires that any diversion of forest land should be compensated by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.

In the first case, the court found that the land allotted to the petitioners was part of forest land and therefore the allotment was in breach of the Forest (Conservation) Act. The court also examined the challenge made by the petitioners against the revised allotment of land and found that the revision was legal. However, the court directed the state government to make the land cultivable and hand over possession within a period of one month. The court also directed the state government to refund the amount paid by the petitioners with reasonable interest.

If any petitioner who has paid the amount is not allotted the land, then the amount paid by them or their legal representatives shall be refunded with interest at the rate of 12% p.a. within three months from the date of receipt of writ of this court. The rule in each petition is discharged and there shall be no order as to costs.

The court's order in both cases highlights the importance of complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act and ensuring that forest land is not diverted for non-forestry purposes without the approval of the central government. The court's order also emphasizes the need to compensate for any diversion of forest land by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.

The court's order in both cases also underscores the importance of ensuring that land allotted for cultivation is cultivable and that possession is handed over to the allottees within a reasonable period of time. The court's order to refund the amount paid by the petitioners with reasonable interest also serves as a deterrent against any breach of the law and ensures that the petitioners are not unfairly disadvantaged.

In conclusion, the court's order in both cases serves as a reminder of the importance of complying with the Forest (Conservation) Act and ensuring that forest land is not diverted for non-forestry purposes without the approval of the central government. The court's order also emphasizes the need to compensate for any diversion of forest land by afforestation on an equivalent area of non-forest land.
