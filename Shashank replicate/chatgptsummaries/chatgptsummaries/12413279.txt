In the first court order, the accused was found guilty of over speeding while driving a vehicle at a speed of 46 km/h in violation of the prescribed speed limit of 40 km/h. The prosecution attempted to establish that the accused had violated the permit conditions fixed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, but the defense argued that the permit conditions did not apply to vehicles with inter-state permits and national goods permits. The court found the accused guilty of over speeding but acquitted him of violating the Hon'ble Supreme Court's directions.

The case highlights the importance of adhering to prescribed speed limits while driving on the roads. Over speeding can lead to accidents and put the lives of the driver and other road users at risk. The court's decision to find the accused guilty of over speeding sends a strong message to other drivers to follow the prescribed speed limits and avoid putting themselves and others in danger.

However, the defense's argument that the permit conditions did not apply to vehicles with inter-state permits and national goods permits raises questions about the applicability of such conditions. It is important for the authorities to clarify the scope and applicability of permit conditions to avoid confusion and ensure that all drivers are aware of their obligations.

In the second court order, the details of the case are not provided in the summary. However, it pertains to a case between the State of Delhi and Sudama regarding a vehicle with registration number DL 1LE 4298 and challan number 278723. Without the details of the case, it is difficult to comment on the court's decision or its implications.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of following traffic rules and regulations while driving on the roads. It is essential for drivers to be aware of their obligations and adhere to prescribed speed limits and permit conditions to ensure the safety of themselves and other road users. The authorities must also provide clarity on the scope and applicability of permit conditions to avoid confusion and ensure that all drivers are aware of their obligations.
