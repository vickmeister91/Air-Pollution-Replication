The case of Sajjan Singh vs. Regional Forest Officer, Forest Department, Barmer revolves around the seizure of forest produce and tools and the subsequent forwarding of information to the Judicial Magistrate by the Regional Forest Officer. Sajjan Singh, the petitioner, filed criminal misc. petitions under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against the Regional Forest Officer, alleging that he was involved in the commission of an offense in respect of the forest produce. The petitioner argued that there is no provision under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 or the Rules made thereunder to register an FIR regarding the commission of a crime under the Act of 1953 or under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The court, however, dismissed the petitions, stating that the action of the Regional Forest Officer, Barmer cannot be said to be illegal in any manner. The court held that the Regional Forest Officer had the power to seize the forest produce and tools and to forward information to the Judicial Magistrate. The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the legality of the seizure of the forest produce and tools, and therefore, the court could not go into the merits of the case.

The court further observed that the petitioner had not made out a case for quashing the FIR or the complaint filed against him. The court held that the FIR and the complaint were based on the information received from the Regional Forest Officer, and therefore, the petitioner could not challenge the FIR or the complaint without challenging the action of the Regional Forest Officer.

The court also noted that the petitioner had not challenged the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate to take cognizance of the offense alleged against him. The court held that the Judicial Magistrate had the power to take cognizance of the offense and that the petitioner could not challenge the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate without challenging the legality of the action of the Regional Forest Officer.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the petitions filed by the petitioner, stating that the action of the Regional Forest Officer, Barmer was not illegal in any manner. The court held that the petitioner had not made out a case for quashing the FIR or the complaint filed against him and that he could not challenge the jurisdiction of the Judicial Magistrate without challenging the legality of the action of the Regional Forest Officer. This case highlights the importance of challenging the legality of actions taken by authorities before challenging the jurisdiction of the court or the legality of complaints and FIRs filed against the petitioner.
