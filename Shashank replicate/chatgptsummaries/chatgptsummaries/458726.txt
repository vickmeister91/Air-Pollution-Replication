The Karnataka High Court recently heard a writ petition from the Vijayanagar Educational Trust challenging the order of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Appellate Authority's order. The petitioner claimed to be a registered trust with the objective of imparting education by setting up schools, colleges, technical institutions, etc. The trust wanted to establish a medical college and hospital in Lingenahalli Village, Nelamangala Taluk, Bangalore Rural District. The Board refused to grant permission to establish the medical college and hospital, citing environmental concerns. 

The petitioner argued that there was deemed consent under Section 25(7) of the Act, but the Board argued that the application was incomplete. The court examined the legal consequences of the Board's refusal after the deadline prescribed under the statute and found that there was no reference to the application being incomplete. The court also found that the Appellate Authority had made a new case for itself, rendering its finding on this point bad both in law and on facts.

The court order discusses two main issues. The first issue is whether there was deemed consent for the establishment of a hospital, and the court concludes that there was. The second issue is whether the Board had the power to refuse permission for the hospital's establishment, and the court finds that the Board did not follow the proper procedure and did not consider the potential environmental risks. The court also criticizes the Board for not providing the petitioner with an opportunity to address any concerns about potential environmental damage. The court ultimately rules in favor of the petitioner and allows the hospital to be established.

The court order discusses the issue of establishing a hospital and the potential danger it may pose to the environment. The court notes that the previous orders did not consider the pollutants that may be emitted by the hospital and whether they would pose a significant environmental risk. The court cites previous cases where the principle of sustained development was applied, allowing for the establishment of institutions that improve human life while ensuring the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems. 

The court ultimately allows the establishment of the hospital but directs the Board to make a detailed study of potential pollutants and to direct the petitioner to take all necessary precautions to offset any danger to the environment. The court also dismisses a request to direct the National Environmental Appellate Authority to investigate the matter.

In summary, the Karnataka High Court heard a writ petition from the Vijayanagar Educational Trust challenging the order of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Appellate Authority's order. The petitioner wanted to establish a medical college and hospital in Lingenahalli Village, Nelamangala Taluk, Bangalore Rural District, but the Board refused to grant permission to establish the medical college and hospital, citing environmental concerns. 

The court examined the legal consequences of the Board's refusal and found that there was no reference to the application being incomplete.
