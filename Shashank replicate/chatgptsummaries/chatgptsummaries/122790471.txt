The National Green Tribunal heard an appeal by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd. against the West Bengal Pollution Control Board's directions to comply with environmental standards and submit an action plan for liquid effluent discharge. The appellant argued that the board had no power to impose penalties and that their right to a hearing was denied. The board argued that they were authorized to monitor compliance with pollution control laws and that the appellant had violated standards. The tribunal heard both sides and issued a judgment on March 19, 2012.

The court order discusses a dispute between an appellant and the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) regarding the WBPCB's power to impose penalties and issue directions under Section 33A of the Water Act. The appellant argues that the WBPCB lacked the power to impose penalties and issue directions without clear and unambiguous provisions in the Act, while the WBPCB argues that its powers under Section 33A are wide and compensatory in nature. The court considers various legal precedents and principles, including sustainable development, the precautionary principle, and the polluter pays principle, and ultimately concludes that the WBPCB has the power to issue directions under Section 33A, but such powers are subject to other provisions of the Act and Rules. The court also notes that factual disputes between the parties are not relevant to the broader legal issues at hand.

The court order discusses the power of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) to issue directions under Section 33A of the Water Act. The court concludes that the power is not unbridled and is subject to reasonable restrictions prescribed by the Act and Rule. The court also notes that before applying the principle of "polluter should pay," the authority must determine the damage caused by the polluter and the amount necessary to rectify the damage. The court sets aside the direction issued by the WBPCB and directs the Central Pollution Control Board to collect and analyze effluent from the appellant's plant for heavy metals and prepare a report. The cost of the analysis will be borne by the appellant. The renewal of the consent to operate the plant will depend on the report.

The court has ordered the Appellant to deposit certified copies of the judgment with the CPCB within two weeks. The renewal of the plant's consent to operate will depend on the report of the Central Pollution Control Board. The Appellant must communicate a copy of the direction to the CPCB at their own cost. Each party will bear their own costs. The order was made on March 19, 2012, by Dr. G.K Pandey and Justice A.S. Naidu.
