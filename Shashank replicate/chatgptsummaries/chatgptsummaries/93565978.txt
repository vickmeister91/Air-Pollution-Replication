The court orders in question relate to two separate cases involving child custody disputes. In the first case, Basanti Devi filed a habeas corpus petition seeking custody of her son, who she alleged was being held by her father-in-law. The court noted that such petitions have become increasingly common in cases involving child custody disputes, and that parties should instead seek relief under the Guardian and Wards Act. The court also noted that the petitioner's case involved a number of criminal complaints and disputes, and ultimately denied the petition.

In the second case, a mother was engaged in a custody battle with her father-in-law over her three-year-old child. The mother had visited her father-in-law's house to see her son, but he filed a criminal complaint against her, resulting in her being detained for 24 hours. The court dismissed the mother's petition for custody and suggested that she seek legal recourse under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, instead of resorting to criminal cases and police intervention. The court emphasized that the welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration in such cases. The petitioner was given the liberty to seek appropriate remedies under the Guardian and Wards Act or other means.

Both court orders highlight the importance of seeking legal remedies under the appropriate laws and regulations in cases involving child custody disputes. The Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, provides a framework for determining the custody of minors and their property, and is the appropriate legal recourse in such cases. Resorting to criminal complaints and police intervention can often exacerbate the situation and lead to unnecessary conflict and tension.

The court in the first case noted that the petitioner's case involved a number of criminal complaints and disputes, which suggests that there may have been underlying issues beyond the custody dispute. It is important for parties involved in such disputes to address any underlying issues and seek appropriate legal remedies to ensure the welfare of the child.

In the second case, the court emphasized that the welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration in determining custody. This is in line with the best interests of the child principle, which is a fundamental principle in child custody cases. The best interests of the child principle requires that the court consider all relevant factors, including the child's physical, emotional, and psychological needs, as well as the child's age, gender, and cultural background.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of seeking legal remedies under the appropriate laws and regulations in cases involving child custody disputes. The Guardian and Wards Act, 1890, provides a framework for determining the custody of minors and their property, and is the appropriate legal recourse in such cases. The welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration in determining custody, and parties involved in such disputes should address any underlying issues and seek appropriate legal remedies to ensure the welfare of the child.
