In a recent court order, three individuals who were accused of possessing 35 kg of Sambarmeat, skin, and an iron sickle in a forest area were granted bail. The petitioners had filed a criminal petition requesting their release on bail, and the court allowed their petition, ordering their release on bail upon executing a personal bond and subject to certain conditions.

The court considered several factors before granting bail to the petitioners. Firstly, the court noted that the offenses alleged were not punishable with extreme penalty. This means that the nature of the offenses was not severe enough to warrant the continued detention of the petitioners. Additionally, the court took into account the fact that the petitioners had been in custody since 12.09.2013. This means that the petitioners had already spent a significant amount of time in detention, and the court felt that it was appropriate to grant them bail.

The court also imposed certain conditions on the petitioners as a condition of their bail. These conditions were designed to ensure that the petitioners would not abscond or interfere with the investigation. The conditions included executing a personal bond, providing sureties, and reporting to the police station on a regular basis.

Overall, the court's decision to grant bail to the petitioners was based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case. The court recognized that the petitioners had been in custody for a significant amount of time and that the offenses alleged were not severe enough to warrant their continued detention. At the same time, the court imposed certain conditions on the petitioners to ensure that they would not abscond or interfere with the investigation.

It is important to note that the court's decision to grant bail does not mean that the petitioners have been acquitted of the charges against them. The investigation and trial will continue, and the petitioners will have to face the charges against them in court. However, the court's decision to grant bail does provide some relief to the petitioners, who will now be able to await trial outside of custody.
