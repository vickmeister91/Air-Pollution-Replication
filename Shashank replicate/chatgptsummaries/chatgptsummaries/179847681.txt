The court order in question pertains to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Iliyas Mamu Mohd Yusuf Lakhara against various government authorities and individuals regarding the possession of protected forest land in Jalna, Maharashtra. The respondents in the case include the Union of India, the State of Maharashtra, and various individuals and organizations. The case number is WP 389/09 & PIL 71/11. The order also lists the lawyers representing each party.

The court had issued an ad-interim order in 2011, directing no further allotment or transfer of the land. The petitioner later expressed a desire to withdraw the PIL, which was denied by the court. The court appointed an amicus curiae to assist in the case, and various affidavits were filed by officers from the Forest and Revenue Departments. The court also directed the District Superintendent of Land Records to file an affidavit explaining the details of the measurement carried out. The court also noted that a writ petition filed in 2009 by the petitioner regarding the same subject matter was pending.

The court heard arguments from both sides and it was proposed to hand over an alternative site to the Forest Department. The Forest Department has filed an affidavit stating that the land is still a proposed reserved forest and no subsequent notification has been issued for deforestation. The court found that while a notification was issued declaring the land as proposed forest land, no further steps were taken to officially reserve the land as a forest. The land was occupied by various individuals, and in 1969, the government of Maharashtra issued a resolution to release forest lands permanently for cultivation to the respective leaseholders. The court also references previous judgments to argue that unless further steps are taken to officially reserve the land as a forest, it cannot be considered forest land.

The court also discussed the regularization of encroachments on forest lands and the deforestation of lands in the midst of forests, which should be released to leaseholders while remaining under the control of the Forests department. The order notes that the writ land in question was cultivated prior to 1969 and has been used for residential purposes for over 30 years, with no trace of forest remaining. The State Government has acted on its decision to hand over the land to the Revenue Department, and the land is now being used by the Police Training Institute.

The court expressed displeasure at the State's handling of land proposed for a forest and its release to the Revenue Department instead of preserving it. The court emphasizes the importance of balancing sustainable development with ecology and protection of the environment. The State is expected to transfer alternative land to be maintained as a forest on a priority basis. The Public Interest Litigation and writ petition are disposed of with no further costs, and 50% of the costs deposited by the petitioner are to be transferred to the Legal Aid Sub-Committee and Aurangabad High Court Bar Association.
