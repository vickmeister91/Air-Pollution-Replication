However, the Allahabad High Court dismissed his petition, stating that the National Green Tribunal's order was applicable to all brick kilns in the region and that there was no reason to make an exception for Malkhan Singh's brick kiln. The court also suggested that Malkhan Singh approach the National Green Tribunal for redressal of his grievance.

The case highlights the importance of environmental norms and the need for strict enforcement of these norms to protect the environment. The National Green Tribunal's order to close all brick kilns in the National Capital Region was a necessary step to address the issue of air pollution in the region. The court's decision to dismiss Malkhan Singh's petition reinforces the need for compliance with environmental norms and the consequences of non-compliance.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision to dismiss Malkhan Singh's writ petition seeking relief from the National Green Tribunal's order highlights the importance of environmental norms and the need for strict enforcement of these norms to protect the environment. The court's decision reinforces the need for compliance with environmental norms and the consequences of non-compliance.
