The case in question involves a writ petition filed by Sri V Jayakumar against the Assistant Regional Transport Officer and the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Economic Offences Division. The petitioner claimed that the police official had instructed the officers to block entries in the registers concerning his new Audi A4. The police official had issued a notice under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, to restrain the alienation of the vehicle, as the previous owner, Smt. Disha Chowdry, was involved in several criminal cases of fraud and fabrication.

The petitioner argued that the police did not have the power to restrain the sale or alienation of the vehicle, and the only power they had was to ask for its production if necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code. The court agreed with the petitioner and held that the police did not have the power to restrain the sale or alienation of the vehicle. The court also held that the police could only ask for the production of the vehicle if it was genuinely necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code.

The court further ordered that the production of any evidence for an investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding must be genuinely necessary and not an abuse of power. The court granted a writ of Certiorari to quash a police notice and communication that restricts the sale or alienation of a vehicle, and a writ of Mandamus to remove a block out concerning the records relating to the vehicle in the official computer system.

The court's order does not prevent the police from proceeding with the investigation and seeking production of the vehicle if genuinely required. However, the police must ensure that their actions are not an abuse of power and that they have genuine reasons for seeking the production of the vehicle.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case clarifies the powers of the police in relation to the restraint of the sale or alienation of a vehicle. The court has made it clear that the police do not have the power to restrain the sale or alienation of a vehicle unless it is genuinely necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under the Code. The court's order also emphasizes the importance of ensuring that the production of any evidence for an investigation, inquiry, trial, or other proceeding is genuinely necessary and not an abuse of power.
