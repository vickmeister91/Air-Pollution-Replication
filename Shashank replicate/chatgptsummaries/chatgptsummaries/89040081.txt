The case at hand involves a criminal misc. petition filed by Sarvesh Agarwal under Section 482 Cr.P.C. against an order dated 31.5.2018, which rejected his application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. Agarwal is facing proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act initiated by the respondent, Vandana Mali. Agarwal had moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. on 30.5.2018 before the court below and prayed that bank statements of the respondent be summoned. However, the court below rejected the said application while observing that the loan was advanced to Agarwal in cash.

Agarwal challenged the order of the court below by filing a criminal misc. petition before the High Court. The High Court, however, dismissed the petition and the stay petition filed by Agarwal. The court observed that the lower court had rightly rejected Agarwal's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. as the loan was advanced in cash and there was no involvement of any bank in the transaction. Therefore, the bank statements of the respondent were not relevant to the case.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or any other reason, the person who issued the cheque is liable to be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. The section also provides for a legal notice to be sent to the person who issued the cheque, giving him an opportunity to make the payment within 15 days. If the payment is not made within the stipulated time, a complaint can be filed before the court.

In the present case, it appears that Agarwal had issued a cheque to Mali, which was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. As a result, Mali initiated proceedings against Agarwal under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Agarwal, in turn, had moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the court below, seeking the summoning of bank statements of Mali. However, the court below rejected the application, stating that the loan was advanced in cash and there was no involvement of any bank in the transaction.

Agarwal challenged the order of the court below by filing a criminal misc. petition before the High Court. However, the High Court dismissed the petition and the stay petition filed by Agarwal, stating that the lower court had rightly rejected Agarwal's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. as the bank statements of the respondent were not relevant to the case.

In conclusion, the case at hand involves a dispute between Sarvesh Agarwal and Vandana Mali under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Agarwal had moved an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. before the court below, seeking the summoning of bank statements of Mali. However, the court below rejected the application, stating that the loan was advanced in cash and there was no involvement of any bank in the transaction. Agarwal challenged the order of the court below by filing a criminal misc. petition before the High Court, which was dismissed. The High Court observed that the lower court had rightly rejected Agarwal's application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. as the bank statements of the respondent were not relevant to the case.
