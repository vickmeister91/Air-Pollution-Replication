The Madras High Court issued an order on December 14, 2018, in a case involving Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam and LA Bottlers Private Ltd, along with several government entities. The appeal was filed to set aside an order from April 26, 2017, in W.P. (MD) No. 19069 of 2016. Another case, W.P. (MD) No. 11718 of 2014, was also mentioned in the court order. The names of the parties involved and their representatives were listed.

The court order lists various parties involved in two separate petitions filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The first petition requests a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to take necessary action against a bottling factory and close it down. The second petition requests a Writ of Mandamus to direct the respondents to remove unauthorized construction carried out by a private company in a village in Trichy District. The parties involved include government officials, the bottling company, and the petitioners' representatives.

The court order discusses three separate cases filed by different parties. The first case involves an appeal filed by Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukappu Sangam against orders passed by a single judge in a previous case. The second case involves a writ petition filed by Mr. V. Gopal Vallatharasu seeking action against a factory in Trichy District. The third case involves a writ petition filed by Suriyur Vivasayigal Pathukkappu Sangam seeking the removal of an unauthorized construction of a factory. The order provides background information on the establishment of the factory and the licenses and clearances obtained by the writ petitioner company.

The court order describes a dispute between a company and local authorities over the company's use of groundwater for its factory. The company had obtained various approvals and certificates allowing it to draw water from six bore-wells, but faced objections from the local panchayat president and officials. After a peace committee meeting, the company agreed to stop using three of its bore-wells, but was later ordered to close its factory by the fifth respondent, who claimed that the company was running its factory without approval and that agricultural operations were being affected. The company obtained an interim stay and resorted to drawing water from nearby villages, obtaining a new No Objection Certificate. The third respondent returned the company's application for land conversion, citing objections and complaints, but the court directed the company to resubmit its application.

The court ordered the first respondent to consider an application and objections related to the closure of a factory after providing a personal hearing to the sixth respondent. The court also mentioned the filing of a Public Interest Litigation and the sealing of bore-wells without notice. The court remanded the matter back to the second respondent for fresh consideration and dismissed an appeal. The court also held that the closure of the factory would not adversely affect the area as it was not earmarked for industries.

The court order pertains to a dispute over the establishment of a soft drink manufacturing plant on land not designated for industrial use. The writ petitioner company had obtained various licenses and approvals for the plant, including permission to draw water from the land. However, objections were raised by a local union and a peace committee meeting was held to settle the issue. The company agreed to extract water from only three bore-wells instead of six, but later decided to outsource the water instead. The matter was remanded back to the government authority for fresh consideration, taking into account public perception and opinion. The order passed by the learned Single Judge was confirmed by one judge and set aside by another. The writ petitioner company has no objection to the decision if the objections and affidavit of undertaking are considered. The appellant argues that the local body is not the competent authority to approve the establishment of the plant.

The court order states that the local body is not authorized to grant approval for a soft drinks bottling plant, and without approval from the Directorate of Town and Country Planning, the permission granted by the local body is not legally valid. The petitioner had obtained various licenses and certificates from competent authorities for establishing the bottling unit, including a license from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India and a stability certificate from the Chief Inspector of Factories. The petitioner had also entered into an agreement with the Public Works Department for ground water utilization. However, the court order does not provide a final decision on the writ petition.

The court order describes a dispute between a company and the government over the company's use of groundwater for their plant. The company had agreements with the government to draw water from bore-wells, but the government later ordered the closure of some of the wells due to complaints from the public and agricultural impacts. The company filed multiple petitions challenging the closure and rejection of their application for land conversion. The court ultimately remanded the matter back to the government to reconsider the issue based on an affidavit of undertaking from the company stating they would no longer draw water from the subject land.

The court order confirms the decision to remand the matter regarding a factory construction project. The court emphasizes the need to balance environmental protection and industrialization, and notes that the factory has provided employment opportunities. The court disagrees with the finding that the land is in a mixed residential zone and suggests that the issue needs to be decided by the competent authority. The court
