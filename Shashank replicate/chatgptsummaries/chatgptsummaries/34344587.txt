The court order in question pertains to a criminal writ petition filed by Ramesh Fulchand Baheti against Sandesh Kamalkishorji Randad and others. The challenge in the petition is against an order passed by the 7th Judicial Magistrate in a summary criminal case, which directed the petitioner to produce a document under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner argued that an accused cannot be directed to produce documents under this section, and the court agreed with this interpretation.

The court noted that Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or other thing that is necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. However, the court also observed that this power cannot be used to compel an accused to produce documents that may incriminate them.

In this case, the trial court had directed the petitioner to produce a Partnership Deed under Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The petitioner had argued that the Partnership Deed was not relevant to the case and that the trial court had no authority to direct its production. The court agreed with the petitioner's argument and held that the trial court's order was not sustainable.

The court also noted that the trial court had observed that there was nothing incriminating against the petitioner in the document sought to be produced. However, the court held that this observation could only be made after reading the contents of the document. Since the document was not on record, the court found that the trial court had gone through the contents of a document that was not on record, and therefore the impugned order cannot be sustained.

The court ordered the petitioner to produce the Partnership Deed on record, noting that the trial court's observations can only be on record if they have read the contents of the deed. The court also instructed the trial court to dispose of the case as expeditiously as possible within six months.

In conclusion, the court order in this case clarifies the scope of Section 91 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and emphasizes that an accused cannot be compelled to produce documents that may incriminate them. The court also highlights the importance of maintaining accurate records and ensuring that trial courts do not go through documents that are not on record. The order serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the principles of justice and fairness in criminal proceedings.
