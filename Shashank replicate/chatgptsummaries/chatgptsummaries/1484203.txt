The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Cottage Industries Exposition Ltd. challenging the criminal proceedings initiated by Customs and Wildlife Department officials under the Customs Act and Wildlife Protection Act, respectively, and the seizure of 12 shawls suspected to be made of 'Shahtoosh wool'. The main question raised in the petition is whether the phrase 'animal article' excludes 'animal hair'. The petitioner argues that 'hair' is not clearly a part of the definition of 'animal article' under the Wildlife Protection Act. The respondents argue that the raw wool of Chiru, whether naturally shed or otherwise obtained, would fall within the definition of uncured trophy, and the thread from such processed wool, including the shawls woven from such thread, would be covered by the definition of animal article.

The court order discusses the definitions of various terms under the Wildlife Protection Act and concludes that the intention of the Parliament while enacting the provisions contained in Chapter 5A was to impose a complete prohibition on the manufacture and trade in Scheduled animal articles, and that the raw wool of Chiru would fall within the definition of uncured trophy and the thread from such processed wool, including the shawls woven from such thread, would be covered by the definition of animal article. The court held that the definition of scheduled animal article includes articles made from the hair of a scheduled animal and the manufacture or trading of such articles is completely prohibited. The court also discussed the principles of statutory interpretation and the duty of the court to give effect to the legislative intent. The court further noted that the international trade in animal articles is regulated by the Import and Export Policy, which prohibits the export of all forms of wildlife including their parts and products. The main issue in the case was whether the hair of the animal Chiru formed part of an animal article as defined in the Act.

The court order states that the use of Chiru hair in producing Shahtoosh shawls is not hit by the bar prescribed under Section 49(B) of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, as 'hair' is not part of the definition of animal article. The court rejects the petitioner's argument that 'hair' is not part of the animal Chiru, as it leads to anomalies and absurdities in the construction of the phrase 'animal article'. The court emphasizes that the intention of the legislature is primarily to be gathered from the language used, and a rule of construction should be preferred which advances the purpose and object of legislation.

The court order discusses the definition of "animal article" and whether it includes products derived from the hair of the Chiru animal, such as the Shahtoosh shawl. The court concludes that the definition of "animal article" does include such products, as the legislature did not specifically exclude animal hair from the definition. The court also notes that trade in such products is prohibited under the Wildlife (Protection) Act and international laws protecting endangered species. The court emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutes in a way that does not render them futile and upholds the prohibition on trade in Shahtoosh.

The court order emphasizes the importance of interpreting statutes in a way that gives effect to the legislative intent and purpose. The court rejects any construction that would reduce a statute to futility and instead accepts a bolder construction to bring about an effective result. The court also notes that technical meanings should be attributed to words related to a particular trade or profession, but in this case, the dictionary meaning should be adhered to for the purpose of giving effect to the purport and object of the Act. The court dismisses the writ petition as it would defeat the legislative intent of preservation of wildlife.
