The Indian judiciary system is known for its strict adherence to the rule of law and the principles of justice. In this regard, the courts have been instrumental in ensuring that justice is served to all parties involved in a case. This is evident in the court orders discussed below, which involve criminal appeals filed by Shakeel Ahmed and the examination of witnesses in a case involving the death of Kulusumbi.

The first court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Shakeel Ahmed against the State of Karnataka. Ahmed was convicted for the murder of Ashraf Ahamed and sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine. The court found that the prosecution's evidence, including a dying declaration and voluntary statement by the accused, supported the conviction. The defense argued that there were no eyewitnesses and the dying declaration was not reliable without corroboration. The court rejected these arguments and upheld the conviction.

The court's decision was based on the evidence presented by the prosecution, which included a dying declaration made by the victim before her death. The court found that the dying declaration was reliable and corroborated by other evidence, such as the voluntary statement made by the accused. The court also noted that the absence of eyewitnesses did not necessarily mean that the accused was innocent. In this regard, the court held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt and that the conviction was justified.

The second court order discusses the examination of witnesses in a case involving the death of Kulusumbi. The court heard from several witnesses, including police officers, doctors, and a Tahsildar who recorded Kulusumbi's dying declaration. The court found that the accused had assaulted Kulusumbi and Ashraf Ahmad with a chopper, resulting in their deaths. The court convicted the accused of murder and dismissed the appeal.

The court's decision was based on the testimony of the witnesses, which established that the accused had committed the crime. The court noted that the dying declaration made by Kulusumbi was reliable and corroborated by other evidence, such as the medical reports and the testimony of the witnesses. The court also rejected the defense's argument that the accused had acted in self-defense, holding that the evidence did not support this claim.

In addition to the above, the court also appointed an Amicus Curiae and set a fee for their services. An Amicus Curiae is a person appointed by the court to assist in a case, particularly in cases where the court requires expert advice or assistance. The court's decision to appoint an Amicus Curiae was based on the complexity of the case and the need for expert assistance. The court also set a fee for their services, which is a common practice in such cases.

In conclusion, the court orders discussed above demonstrate the Indian judiciary's commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring that justice is served to all parties involved in a case. The courts have been instrumental in ensuring that the evidence presented is reliable and that the accused is given a fair trial. The appointment of an Amicus Curiae in complex cases is also a testament to the court's commitment to ensuring that justice is served. Overall, these court orders serve as a reminder of the importance of the judiciary in upholding the principles of justice and the rule of law.
