The court has issued three separate orders in response to petitions filed by various parties against the Haryana State Pollution Control Board. The first order pertains to a petition filed by S.D. Jain and others seeking the quashing of a complaint filed against them under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and all subsequent proceedings. The court heard arguments from both sides and referred to a previous judgment in a similar case. Ultimately, the court quashed the complaint and all subsequent proceedings.

In the second order, the court addressed three petitions filed by the petitioners against an additional complaint filed by the respondent-Board during the pendency of an original complaint. The court found that the additional complaint was not maintainable and the impugned summoning order was without jurisdiction. The court allowed all three petitions and stated that the complainant-Board could move an appropriate application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage of the criminal trial of the original complaint. The court also referred to relevant judgments and observations made in those judgments.

The third order states that the cognizance of an offense can only be taken once and that the additional complaint and summoning order cannot be sustained. The complainant is allowed to move an appropriate application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. at the appropriate stage of the trial to summon other accused persons. The complaint and subsequent proceedings are quashed to prevent any further abuse of the process of law and to secure the ends of justice. The petition is allowed with the above-said observations made and directions issued.

In all three orders, the court has taken a firm stance against any abuse of the legal process and has emphasized the importance of following proper procedures. The court has also referred to relevant judgments and legal provisions to support its decisions. These orders serve as a reminder to all parties involved in legal proceedings to act in accordance with the law and to avoid any actions that may be deemed as an abuse of the legal process.
