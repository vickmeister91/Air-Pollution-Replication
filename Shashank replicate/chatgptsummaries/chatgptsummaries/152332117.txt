The court order in question pertains to a petition filed by Raj Reddy Kallem under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C). The petition sought to set aside an order passed by a learned J.M.I.C. (Judicial Magistrate of the First Class). However, the court has now deemed the petition to be infructuous, as the petitioner has since been convicted.

As a result, the court has disposed of the present petition as not pressed. This means that the petitioner has effectively withdrawn their petition, as it is no longer relevant or necessary given their conviction.

Section 482 of the Cr.P.C provides for the inherent powers of the High Court to make orders necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, or to prevent abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice. This section is often invoked in cases where there is a need to set aside or modify an order passed by a lower court.

In this case, it appears that the petitioner had filed the petition to challenge an order passed by a Judicial Magistrate. However, since the petitioner has now been convicted, the petition has become infructuous. This means that the relief sought by the petitioner is no longer relevant or necessary, as their conviction has effectively rendered the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate moot.

The court's decision to dispose of the petition as not pressed indicates that the petitioner did not contest the court's finding that the petition had become infructuous. This may be because the petitioner realized that their conviction had made the petition irrelevant, or because they did not wish to pursue the matter further.

Overall, this court order highlights the importance of timing in legal proceedings. Had the petitioner filed their petition earlier, before their conviction, it may have had a greater chance of success. However, since the petitioner waited until after their conviction to file the petition, it became infructuous and was ultimately disposed of by the court.
