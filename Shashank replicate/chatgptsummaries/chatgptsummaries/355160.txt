The case in question revolves around the leasing of a site in a reserved forest area to a private company for the purpose of establishing a snack bar and restaurant. The Conservator of Forests raised objections to the lease, citing the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, which mandates that prior approval from the Central Government is required for any non-forest use of forest land. 

The High Court of Bombay initially ruled that the Act did not apply to Union Territories. However, the Supreme Court disagreed with this interpretation and ordered the Collector to seek approval from the Central Government. The Court emphasized the need to balance the priorities of tourism and forest conservation and directed the Collector to send the proposal and objection to the Central Government for consideration by an Advisory Committee. The entire process was to be completed within three months.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, was enacted to regulate the diversion of forest land for non-forestry purposes. The Act requires that prior approval be obtained from the Central Government for any non-forest use of forest land. The Act also mandates that the State Governments and Union Territories must seek the advice of an Expert Committee before granting approval for such use.

In this case, the Supreme Court held that the Act applies to Union Territories as well, and that the Collector must seek approval from the Central Government before leasing forest land for non-forest use. The Court emphasized the importance of balancing the need for tourism development with the need to protect forest areas. 

The Court directed the Collector to send the proposal and objection to the Central Government for consideration by an Advisory Committee. The Committee was to be composed of experts in the fields of forestry, wildlife, and tourism. The Committee was tasked with examining the proposal and the objections raised by the Conservator of Forests and making recommendations to the Central Government.

The Court also set a deadline of three months for the entire process to be completed. This was done to ensure that the matter was resolved in a timely manner and to prevent any further damage to the forest area.

The Court's decision in this case highlights the importance of protecting forest areas and balancing the need for tourism development with the need to preserve natural resources. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, plays a crucial role in regulating the use of forest land for non-forestry purposes and ensuring that such use is carried out in a sustainable and responsible manner.

In conclusion, the Supreme Court's decision in this case underscores the need to protect forest areas and the importance of obtaining prior approval from the Central Government before leasing forest land for non-forest use. The Court's emphasis on balancing the priorities of tourism and forest conservation is a reminder that sustainable development is key to preserving our natural resources for future generations.
