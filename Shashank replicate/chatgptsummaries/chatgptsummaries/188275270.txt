The Patna High Court has granted bail to Sunil Chaudhary, who was facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Bihar Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 1972, and the Prevention of Pollution Act, 1986. Chaudhary is the owner and driver of one of the tractors involved in illegal mining and carriage of sand.

The court has ordered Chaudhary to furnish a bail bond of Rs. 20,000 and cooperate with the investigation/trial of the case. The decision was made after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the allegations, the evidence on record, and the possibility of Chaudhary absconding or tampering with evidence.

The case against Chaudhary and others was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Deputy Collector of the Mining Department. The complaint alleged that Chaudhary and others were involved in illegal mining and transportation of sand from the riverbed of the Ganga in violation of the Bihar Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 1972, and the Prevention of Pollution Act, 1986.

The investigation revealed that Chaudhary and others were using tractors to extract sand from the riverbed and transport it to various places for sale. The investigation also revealed that the accused were not only violating the mining rules but were also causing damage to the environment by polluting the river.

Chaudhary was arrested on 22nd June 2021, and has been in judicial custody since then. He had applied for bail earlier, but his application was rejected by the lower court. Chaudhary then approached the Patna High Court for bail.

The High Court, while granting bail to Chaudhary, has imposed certain conditions. Chaudhary has been directed to cooperate with the investigation and trial of the case, not to tamper with evidence, not to leave the country without the permission of the court, and to attend all court hearings.

The court has also directed Chaudhary to furnish a personal bond of Rs. 20,000 and two sureties of the like amount. The sureties have to be local residents and should be able to furnish proof of their identity and address.

The court has further directed Chaudhary to surrender his passport, if any, and not to apply for a new one without the permission of the court. Chaudhary has also been directed to report to the investigating officer as and when required.

In conclusion, the Patna High Court has granted bail to Sunil Chaudhary, who was facing charges under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Bihar Mines and Minerals Concession Rules, 1972, and the Prevention of Pollution Act, 1986. The court has imposed certain conditions on Chaudhary, including the furnishing of a bail bond of Rs. 20,000 and cooperation with the investigation/trial of the case. The decision was made after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, including the nature of the allegations, the evidence on record, and the possibility of Chaudhary absconding or tampering with evidence.
