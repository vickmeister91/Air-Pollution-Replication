The court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed by Sh. Isher Singh and others against the State (Govt. of NCT) and others. The complainants alleged that respondent no. 2, a trading member of the National Stock Exchange of India, conducted transactions in their accounts illegally and without their consent. The complainants filed an application under Section 156(3) CrPC for directions to the police to record an FIR and investigate the matter. However, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate dismissed the application, stating that the complainants had all the evidence within their knowledge and reach and that there was no requirement for police investigation.

The complainants then filed a revision petition before the Sessions Court, challenging the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate. The Sessions Court dismissed the revision petition, stating that the complainants had an alternative remedy available to them under Section 202 of the CrPC, which provides for an inquiry or investigation by a Magistrate before taking cognizance of an offence.

The complainants then filed a criminal revision petition before the High Court, challenging the orders of the Metropolitan Magistrate and the Sessions Court. The High Court observed that the complainants had not challenged the order of the Metropolitan Magistrate before the Sessions Court, and therefore, the order had attained finality. The High Court further observed that the Sessions Court had rightly dismissed the revision petition, as the complainants had an alternative remedy available to them under Section 202 of the CrPC.

The High Court then proceeded to examine the merits of the case. The court observed that the complainants had alleged that respondent no. 2 had conducted transactions in their accounts illegally and without their consent. The court noted that the complainants had not produced any documentary evidence to support their allegations. The court further observed that the complainants had not approached the Trial Court for the production of necessary documents under Section 91 of the CrPC.

The court held that the complainants could provide evidence to the Trial Court regarding transactions made by respondent no. 2 without their consent. The Trial Magistrate could also be requested to exercise powers under Section 91 of the CrPC to produce necessary documents. If the Metropolitan Magistrate deems it appropriate, an inquiry or investigation can be ordered under Section 202 of the CrPC.

The court found no illegality or irregularity in the impugned order and dismissed the revision petition. The Trial Court record is to be returned and the complainants are to appear before the Trial Court on a specified date.
