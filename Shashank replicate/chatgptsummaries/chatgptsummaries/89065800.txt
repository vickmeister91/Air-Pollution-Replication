The court order in question pertains to an application filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, seeking to quash an order passed by the Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Madhupur at Deoghar, in GOCR Case No.62 of 2004, whereby cognizance was taken against the petitioners for the offence under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act and Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The court found that the notification declaring the forest to be a protected forest had lost its validity, and therefore, no offence could be said to be committed under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act. The court also held that Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act is not a penal provision, and the order taking cognizance under the said section showed complete non-application of the judicial mind.

The court quashed the impugned order and the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners.

To understand the implications of this court order, it is important to first understand the provisions of the Indian Forest Act and the Forest (Conservation) Act.

The Indian Forest Act, 1927, is an act of the Indian Parliament that provides for the conservation of forests and the protection of wildlife. Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act deals with the punishment for felling trees in a reserved forest without a permit. The punishment for such an offence is imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.

The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, is another act of the Indian Parliament that provides for the conservation of forests and the protection of wildlife. Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act deals with the restriction on the de-reservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval of the Central Government. The violation of this provision can result in the cancellation of the approval granted for the use of forest land and the imposition of penalties.

In the present case, the court found that the notification declaring the forest to be a protected forest had lost its validity. This means that the forest in question was no longer a protected forest under the Indian Forest Act. As a result, no offence could be said to be committed under Section 33 of the Indian Forest Act.

The court also held that Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act is not a penal provision. This means that the violation of this provision does not result in criminal liability. The order taking cognizance under the said section showed complete non-application of the judicial mind.

Based on these findings, the court quashed the impugned order and the entire criminal proceeding against the petitioners.

This court order has significant implications for the conservation of forests and the protection of wildlife in India. It highlights the importance of ensuring that the legal provisions for the protection of forests and wildlife are applied correctly and in accordance with the law.

It also underscores the need for regular monitoring and review of the notifications declaring forests to be protected forests. If such notifications lose their validity, the forests in question may no longer be protected under the law, and the legal provisions for their protection may no longer apply.

Overall, this court order serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that legal provisions for the protection of forests and wildlife are applied correctly and in accordance with the law.
