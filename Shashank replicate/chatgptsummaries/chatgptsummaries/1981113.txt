The case in question involves a dispute over the appointment of a Rehbar-i-Taleem, a position responsible for guiding and educating students in Jammu and Kashmir. The petitioner, Bashir Ahmad Malik, had been appointed to this position for over two years before being challenged by Manzoor Ahmad Hazari in a civil suit. After considering the case, the respondents found Hazari to be more meritorious and subsequently disengaged Malik from his position, appointing Hazari in his place.

Malik challenged this decision in court, arguing that the principle of natural justice had not been complied with. However, the court ultimately dismissed the petition, finding that Malik was the beneficiary of an illegal act and therefore could not claim a legal right to the position.

The principle of natural justice requires that individuals be given a fair hearing and the opportunity to present their case before any decision is made that may affect their rights or interests. In this case, Malik argued that he had not been given a fair hearing and that the decision to disengage him from his position was therefore unjust.

However, the court found that Malik had benefited from an illegal act, namely his initial appointment to the position without following proper procedures. As such, the court held that Malik could not claim a legal right to the position and that the decision to disengage him was therefore valid.

This case highlights the importance of following proper procedures in the appointment of public officials and the potential consequences of failing to do so. While Malik may have initially benefited from his illegal appointment, he ultimately lost his position due to the challenge brought by Hazari and the subsequent decision of the respondents.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of upholding the principles of natural justice and following proper procedures in all matters related to public appointments and decision-making.
