The court order pertains to a long-standing dispute between two villages in Tamil Nadu over a water supply channel. The plaintiffs, villagers of Karikili Village, filed a lawsuit seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants, villagers of Vellaputhur Village, from interfering with the channel that supplies water to their irrigation tank. The defendants argued that the channel was part of a bird sanctuary and had been maintained by the Forest Department.

The court framed several issues for trial, including whether the defendants had formed a new channel and whether the plaintiffs were entitled to a mandatory injunction. After examining the evidence, the court issued a mandatory injunction against the State of Tamil Nadu and the Forest Department to remove the newly formed channel and restore the land to its original condition.

However, the court's decision was criticized for not considering the policy matters of the government and creating more enmity between the two villages. The defendants filed appeals, but the court did not consider the maintainability of the appeals or the power of the civil court to adjudicate on policy matters of the state.

The court order discusses two separate judgments passed in 1999, which were later appealed by the villagers of Karikilli Village. The appeals were admitted on two substantial questions of law, one regarding the right to draw water from Vellaputhur lake and the other on whether the suit involved a civil right or a policy matter. The court cites previous cases to emphasize that courts should exercise caution when examining policy matters and defer to those with technical expertise. The order suggests that the second substantial question of law will determine whether the court can proceed further with the case.

The court order pertains to two Second Appeals filed by the appellants against a judgment and decree made in A.S.Nos.36 & 37 of 1998, dated 05.11.1999 on the file of the Sub Court, Maduranthakam, in turn confirming the judgment and decree made in O.S.Nos.77 & 78 of 1996 dated 25.09.1997 on the file of the District Munsif Court, Maduranthakam. The court provides details of the parties involved and the history of the case, including the transfer of two suits from the Sub Court, Chengalpattu to the District Munsif Court, Maduranthakam. The court also notes that no appeal had been preferred against the judgment in O.S.No.86 of 1996. Finally, the court states that both appeals were dismissed by the learned Sub Judge, Maduranthakam.

In 1999, the Sub Judge of Maduranthakam dismissed two appeals. The fourth defendant in O.S.No.77 of 1996 filed S.A.No.680 of 2000, and the plaintiff in O.S.No.78 of 1996 filed S.A.No.681 of 2000. Both appeals were admitted on two common substantial questions of law. The first question was whether the Vellaputhur lake and ayacutdhars have any right to draw water from Survey.No.191, Karikili hills or inundated water from Survey No.189. The second question was whether the suit could be maintained when it only involved a question of policy matters by the government. The suit was filed seeking a judgment and decree for mandatory injunction directing the defendants to remove the newly formed channel and to restore the land to its original condition. The plaintiff claimed a right to draw water from Karikili lake directly in the absence of any other channel than the suit channel either from S.No.191 of S.No.189 hills or from S.No.189 fields by inundation. The first defendant filed a written statement, stating that the suit is...

The court order states that the court will not interfere with matters related to laws, arbitrary or irrational decisions, or abuse of power. The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 protects officers and employees of the government from legal proceedings for actions taken in good faith under the act. The court should refrain from making decisions on policy matters of the government. The Civil Procedure Code and the Courts of Civil Judicature are meant to adjudicate civil issues between individuals or groups, not policy matters of the government. The court holds that the suits filed by the plaintiffs are not maintainable as they involve policy matters of the government. The plaintiffs are advised to give fresh representations to the District Authorities to bring about an amicable solution to their grievances.

The court order allows S.A.No.680 of 2000 and dismisses S.A.No.681 of 2000. The suits in O.S.No.77 of 1996 and O.S.No.78 of 1996 on the file of the District Munsif Court, Maduranthakam are also dismissed. However, the villagers of Karikili Village and Vellaputhur Village can approach the District Collectorate and the District Forest Department for redressal of their grievances. The court appreciates Mr. K. Rajendra Prasad for his initiative. The order is dated 22.02.2019.

In summary, the court order pertains to a dispute between two villages over a water supply channel. The court issued a mandatory injunction against the State of Tamil Nadu and the Forest Department to remove the newly formed channel and restore the land to its original condition. However, the court's decision was criticized for not considering
