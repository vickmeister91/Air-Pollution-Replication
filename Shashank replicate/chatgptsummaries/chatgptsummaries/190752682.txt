In a recent court order, anticipatory bail has been granted to the petitioners in connection with a forest case until June 21, 2017. The order states that if the petitioners are arrested before that date, they will be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court has also scheduled a review of the case on June 21, 2017.

The case in question pertains to a forest-related matter, although the specifics of the case have not been disclosed. The petitioners, however, have been granted anticipatory bail, which means that they will not be arrested in connection with the case until June 21, 2017. This is a temporary relief for the petitioners, who may have been facing the possibility of arrest and detention.

The court order also specifies the conditions under which the petitioners will be released on bail if they are arrested before June 21, 2017. They will need to furnish a bond of Rs. 10,000 each, along with two sureties of the same amount. This is a standard requirement for bail in India, and is meant to ensure that the accused appear in court for their trial.

The court has also set a date for the review of the case, which is June 21, 2017. This means that the petitioners will need to appear in court on that date, and the court will review the case to determine whether or not the bail should be continued. If the court finds that there is sufficient evidence against the petitioners, it may revoke the bail and order their arrest.

It is important to note that anticipatory bail is not a guarantee that the petitioners will not be arrested in connection with the case. It is simply a temporary relief that allows them to avoid arrest until the court reviews the case. The court will still need to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence against the petitioners to warrant their arrest.

In conclusion, the recent court order granting anticipatory bail to the petitioners in connection with a forest case until June 21, 2017 is a temporary relief for the petitioners. If they are arrested before that date, they will be released on bail upon furnishing a bond of Rs. 10,000 each with two sureties of the same amount. The court will review the case again on June 21, 2017 to determine whether or not the bail should be continued. It is important to note that anticipatory bail is not a guarantee that the petitioners will not be arrested in connection with the case, and the court will still need to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence against them to warrant their arrest.
