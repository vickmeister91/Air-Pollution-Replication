The court order in question relates to two writ petitions filed by M/s Runit Fabrics, which challenged a show cause notice and orders passed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner's counsel argued that the consent to operate the industry had expired and that the industry was no longer being run by the petitioner. As a result, the petitions had become irrelevant and were dismissed.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 are two important pieces of legislation in India that aim to prevent and control pollution of water and air, respectively. These acts provide for the establishment of pollution control boards at the central and state levels, as well as the regulation of industries that are likely to cause pollution.

In this case, M/s Runit Fabrics had challenged a show cause notice and orders passed under these acts. The company's counsel argued that the consent to operate the industry had expired and that the industry was no longer being run by the petitioner. This meant that the petitions had become irrelevant and were dismissed by the court.

The concept of consent to operate is an important one in the context of pollution control in India. Under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, industries that are likely to cause pollution are required to obtain consent to operate from the pollution control board. This consent is granted for a specific period of time and is subject to certain conditions.

If an industry fails to obtain or renew its consent to operate, it can be deemed to be operating illegally. This can result in the pollution control board taking action against the industry, including the issuance of show cause notices and orders.

In the case of M/s Runit Fabrics, the company's counsel argued that the consent to operate had expired and that the industry was no longer being run by the petitioner. This meant that the petitions challenging the show cause notice and orders had become irrelevant.

The court's decision to dismiss the petitions highlights the importance of complying with pollution control regulations in India. Industries that are likely to cause pollution must obtain and renew their consent to operate in order to avoid legal action by the pollution control board.

Overall, the court order in question pertains to two writ petitions filed by M/s Runit Fabrics challenging a show cause notice and orders passed under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The company's counsel argued that the consent to operate had expired and that the industry was no longer being run by the petitioner. As a result, the petitions were dismissed by the court. This case highlights the importance of complying with pollution control regulations in India and obtaining and renewing consent to operate in a timely manner.
