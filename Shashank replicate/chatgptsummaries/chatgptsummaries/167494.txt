The Jammu and Kashmir High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by K.P. Paper seeking a writ of mandamus against the State of J&K and others to grant it Permanent Registration and benefits available to industrial units under the Industrial Policy of the State. The petitioner had invested approximately INR 31 crores in setting up a unit for manufacturing paper and had obtained provisional registration and all necessary approvals. However, the respondents had refused to grant Permanent Registration, citing that the petitioner, being a non-permanent resident of the State, was not entitled to lease immovable property in the State.

The court examined the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and concluded that there was no specific bar prohibiting lease of immovable property in favour of non-state subjects. The court also distinguished between the transfer of property and the transfer of the right to enjoy property by way of lease. The court held that lease of immovable property was only a transfer of the right to enjoy the property and did not amount to a transfer of property itself. Therefore, the petitioner was entitled to seek Permanent Registration for its unit.

The court order concludes that the Transfer of Property Act does not prohibit the lease of immovable property in favor of non-state subjects. The court rejects the argument that the introduction of "leases in favor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University and Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University" in Section 140 of the Transfer of Property Act changes the settled position of law that lease of immovable property would not amount to transfer of property itself so as to attract the bar enacted by the above commands for transfer of property in favor of non-state subjects.

The court orders the respondents to consider the petitioner's case for its Permanent Registration and pass appropriate orders thereon in accordance with law within a period of one month. The respondents are further directed to provide the petitioner's unit all those benefits which may be available to it under the Industrial Policy of the State and the laws in force in the State.

This order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the lease of immovable property in Jammu and Kashmir. The court has held that non-state subjects are entitled to lease immovable property in the State and that such lease does not amount to a transfer of property itself. This is a welcome development for non-state subjects who wish to invest in the State and set up industrial units.

The court's interpretation of the Transfer of Property Act is also noteworthy. The court has held that the Act does not prohibit the lease of immovable property in favor of non-state subjects and that the introduction of "leases in favor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University and Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University" in Section 140 of the Act does not change the settled position of law. This interpretation is likely to have far-reaching implications for the real estate sector in the State.

The court's order directing the respondents to consider the petitioner's case for Permanent Registration and to provide the petitioner's unit all those benefits which may be available to it under the Industrial Policy of the State and the laws in force in the State is also significant. This order ensures that the petitioner is not denied the benefits available to industrial units under the Industrial Policy of the State and the laws in force in the State.

In conclusion, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court's order in the writ petition filed by K.P. Paper is a significant development in the legal landscape of the State. The court's interpretation of the Transfer of Property Act and its order directing the respondents to consider the petitioner's case for Permanent Registration and to provide the petitioner's unit all those benefits which may be available to it under the Industrial Policy of the State and the laws in force in the State are likely to have far-reaching implications for the real estate and industrial sectors in the State.
