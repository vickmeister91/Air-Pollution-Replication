The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed an appeal against the acquittal of the Washingghat of Jhinabhai Kathalbhai Gujarati & 2 on charges under sec. 24 and 25 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. However, the High Court of Gujarat dismissed the appeal, stating that the trial court was justified in acquitting the accused as the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The court cited established principles that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the court below if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record.

The case pertained to the alleged violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 by the Washingghat of Jhinabhai Kathalbhai Gujarati & 2. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused, alleging that they had discharged untreated effluent into a nearby water body, thereby causing pollution. The accused had denied the allegations and claimed that they had complied with all the relevant laws and regulations.

During the trial, the prosecution had examined several witnesses and produced documentary evidence to support its case. However, the trial court had found that the prosecution had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and had acquitted the accused. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had then filed an appeal against the acquittal in the High Court of Gujarat.

The High Court of Gujarat, while dismissing the appeal, observed that the trial court had carefully considered the evidence on record and had arrived at a conclusion based on the same. The court noted that the prosecution had failed to establish a clear link between the alleged discharge of untreated effluent by the accused and the pollution of the nearby water body. The court also observed that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that the accused had violated any of the relevant laws or regulations.

The court further cited established principles of law that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the court below if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record. The court noted that in the present case, the trial court had arrived at a conclusion based on the evidence on record and that there was no reason to interfere with the same.

The judgment of the High Court of Gujarat in this case highlights the importance of proving a case beyond reasonable doubt in criminal proceedings. It also underscores the need for the prosecution to produce clear and cogent evidence to support its case. The judgment also serves as a reminder that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the court below unless there are compelling reasons to do so.

In conclusion, the High Court of Gujarat's decision to dismiss the appeal filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board against the acquittal of the Washingghat of Jhinabhai Kathalbhai Gujarati & 2 on charges under sec. 24 and 25 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, highlights the importance of proving a case beyond reasonable doubt in criminal proceedings. The judgment also underscores the need for the prosecution to produce clear and cogent evidence to support its case and serves as a reminder that an appellate court should not interfere with the finding of acquittal recorded by the court below unless there are compelling reasons to do so.
