The Madras High Court recently passed a significant order in a writ petition filed by M/s. Subbayan and Co, seeking the quashing of an order passed by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to seal their premises. The petitioner had set up a charcoal manufacturing unit in 2012 and had obtained consent to establish the unit from the TNPCB. However, the TNPCB had issued directions for the closure of the unit in 2017, citing non-compliance with pollution control measures. The petitioner had ignored the directions and continued production, leading to the sealing of their premises in 2018.

The petitioner had argued that the TNPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while passing the closure order. The petitioner had also contended that the TNPCB had not given them an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The petitioner had further submitted that they had taken steps to comply with the pollution control measures and had submitted a fresh application for consent to operate the unit. However, the TNPCB had not considered their application and had instead sealed their premises.

The TNPCB had opposed the petition and had submitted that the petitioner had not complied with the pollution control measures despite repeated directions. The TNPCB had also argued that the petitioner had not submitted a proper application for consent to operate the unit and had therefore, rightly sealed their premises.

The court, after hearing both parties, observed that the TNPCB had not followed the principles of natural justice while passing the closure order. The court noted that the TNPCB had not given the petitioner an opportunity to be heard before passing the order. The court further observed that the petitioner had taken steps to comply with the pollution control measures and had submitted a fresh application for consent to operate the unit. The court held that the TNPCB should have considered the petitioner's application instead of sealing their premises.

The court, therefore, quashed the order passed by the TNPCB and permitted the petitioner to submit a fresh application for consent to operate the unit, subject to compliance with pollution control measures. The court also directed the TNPCB to consider the petitioner's application within a period of four weeks from the date of receipt of the application.

This order is significant as it highlights the importance of following the principles of natural justice while passing orders that affect the rights of individuals or entities. The order also emphasizes the need for regulatory authorities to consider the applications of individuals or entities who have taken steps to comply with the regulations, instead of taking drastic measures such as sealing their premises.

In conclusion, the Madras High Court's order in the writ petition filed by M/s. Subbayan and Co is a welcome move towards ensuring that regulatory authorities follow due process while passing orders that affect the rights of individuals or entities. The order also serves as a reminder to regulatory authorities to consider the applications of individuals or entities who have taken steps to comply with the regulations, instead of taking drastic measures such as sealing their premises.
