The Karnataka High Court recently passed a judgment in a writ petition filed by M/S. Nagabushan Patil Stone Crusher against the State of Karnataka and other authorities. The petitioner had sought to quash a closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and sought a writ of mandamus to direct the competent authority to consider its application to operate the crushing unit.

The court found that the petitioner was a licensee with a valid license to run the unit and that the closure notice was similar to those issued in other writ petitions. The court followed the decision of a Division Bench in a similar case and quashed the closure notice. The court allowed the petitioner to operate the unit at the present site until its application was considered and disposed of by the licensing authority or for a period of four weeks from the date of the order. No costs were awarded.

The petitioner had contended that the closure notice was issued without any prior notice or opportunity of being heard. The petitioner had also submitted that the closure notice was issued on the basis of a report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner, which was not in accordance with the law. The petitioner had further submitted that the closure notice was issued on the basis of a report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner, which was not in accordance with the law.

The court observed that the petitioner was a licensee with a valid license to run the unit and that the closure notice was similar to those issued in other writ petitions. The court also observed that the petitioner had not been given any prior notice or opportunity of being heard before the closure notice was issued. The court further observed that the report submitted by the Deputy Commissioner was not in accordance with the law and that the closure notice was issued on the basis of the said report.

The court relied on the decision of a Division Bench in a similar case, where it was held that the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was not sustainable in law. The court observed that the present case was similar to the case before the Division Bench and that the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board was not sustainable in law.

The court quashed the closure notice issued by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and directed the competent authority to consider the application of the petitioner to operate the crushing unit. The court also directed the competent authority to dispose of the application within a period of four weeks from the date of the order.
