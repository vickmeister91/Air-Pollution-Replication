The Allahabad High Court recently heard a writ petition filed by Chanda Singh against the State of Uttar Pradesh through Collector and four others. The petitioner requested compensation for the acquired area of Khasra No.46 and a refund of Rs. 31,55,771/- with admissible interest. The court disposed of the petition, allowing the petitioner to make a fresh representation before the respondent no.2 with certified copies of the order within three weeks. The respondent no.2 was directed to pass an appropriate order in accordance with the law within three months after hearing the respondent no.5. The court did not enter into the merits of the case and left the decision to the concerned authority.

The case revolves around the acquisition of land by the State of Uttar Pradesh from Chanda Singh. The petitioner claimed that the State had acquired the land without following the proper legal procedures and without providing adequate compensation. The petitioner sought compensation for the acquired land and a refund of the amount paid by the State.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, disposed of the petition. The court allowed the petitioner to make a fresh representation before the respondent no.2 with certified copies of the order within three weeks. The respondent no.2 was directed to pass an appropriate order in accordance with the law within three months after hearing the respondent no.5.

The court did not enter into the merits of the case and left the decision to the concerned authority. This means that the court did not make a decision on whether the State had acquired the land illegally or whether the compensation provided was adequate. Instead, the court directed the concerned authority to make a decision in accordance with the law.

The court's decision is significant as it provides an opportunity for the petitioner to make a fresh representation before the concerned authority. This means that the petitioner will have another chance to present their case and argue for adequate compensation for the acquired land. The court's decision also ensures that the concerned authority will have to make a decision in accordance with the law, which will provide a fair and just outcome for both parties.

In conclusion, the Allahabad High Court's decision in the writ petition filed by Chanda Singh against the State of Uttar Pradesh through Collector and four others provides an opportunity for the petitioner to make a fresh representation before the concerned authority. The court's decision ensures that the concerned authority will have to make a decision in accordance with the law, which will provide a fair and just outcome for both parties.
