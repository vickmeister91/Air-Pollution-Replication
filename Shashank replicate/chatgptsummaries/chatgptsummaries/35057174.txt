The court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The applicant had issued a cheque of Rs. 25,00,000/- which was returned due to insufficient funds. The respondent filed a complaint and after the evidence of the respondent was over, the case was fixed for defence evidence. 

The applicant filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C seeking direction to the respondent to file certain documents. The application was rejected on the ground that it was filed belatedly after about 9 months from the date when the case was fixed for defence evidence. The court affirmed the order and dismissed the application.

Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act deals with the dishonour of cheques. It states that if a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds, the person who issued the cheque can be held liable for criminal prosecution. The complainant in this case had filed a complaint under this section against the applicant for issuing a cheque that was returned due to insufficient funds.

After the evidence of the complainant was over, the case was fixed for defence evidence. At this stage, the applicant filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C seeking direction to the respondent to file certain documents. Section 91 of the Cr.P.C empowers a court to issue a summons or order to produce any document or thing that is necessary for the purpose of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

However, the application filed by the applicant was rejected by the court on the ground that it was filed belatedly after about 9 months from the date when the case was fixed for defence evidence. The court held that the applicant had ample opportunity to file the application earlier and the delay in filing the application was not justified.

The court affirmed the order and dismissed the application. This means that the respondent was not required to produce the documents sought by the applicant. The court's decision was based on the fact that the application was filed belatedly and the delay was not justified.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. The applicant had issued a cheque of Rs. 25,00,000/- which was returned due to insufficient funds. The respondent filed a complaint and after the evidence of the respondent was over, the case was fixed for defence evidence.
