The court heard multiple appeals from brick kiln owners who were running their kilns within five kilometers of the boundary of the protected area of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary. The Union of India issued a notification declaring the area up to five kilometers from the boundary of the protected area of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary as an Eco-sensitive Zone. The notification prohibited new polluting industries from being set up within the Eco-sensitive Zone and prohibited activities relating to commercial mining, setting up industries causing pollution, commercial use of firewood, discharge of effluents and solid waste in natural water bodies or terrestrial area. The appellants were informed by letter that they were being prohibited from carrying out brick kiln activities. The appellants moved this Court in different writ applications, which were dismissed by the court.

In another case, brick kiln activities were prohibited by the Monitoring Committee due to their potential to cause pollution in the Dalma Eco-sensitive Zone. The appellants argued that their units were already existing before the notification was issued and were not covered by the prohibition. The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ applications, but the appellants appealed to the court. The court found that the writ applications were not maintainable in the High Court and the appellants should have approached the National Green Tribunal. The court dismissed the appeals and gave the appellants the liberty to move the National Green Tribunal for adjudication of their cases afresh.

The court has dismissed all appeals and issued an observation or liberty. An interim order was previously passed directing the appellants not to operate their brick kilns and the order has been extended for four weeks. The appellants may choose to move the National Green Tribunal during this time. The court order was issued on November 16, 2016, in Ranchi.
