In a case involving criminal breach of trust, the petitioner, K.V. Rama Krishna Reddy, filed a criminal miscellaneous petition to obtain documents related to the proceedings before an arbitrator and an award passed by the arbitrator, as well as the decision of the High Court in C.R.P. No. 926 of 1970. The Magistrate dismissed the petition and framed a charge against the petitioner. The petitioner then filed a revision petition, arguing that the Magistrate had the power to summon the documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code even before framing the charge.

The court agreed with the petitioner and set aside the order of the Magistrate. The court quashed the charge and directed the Magistrate to peruse the documents and frame an appropriate charge. The court held that the Magistrate had the power to summon the documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and that the documents were necessary for the proper disposal of the case.

The court noted that the power to summon documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code is not limited to cases where a charge has already been framed. The court held that the power to summon documents can be exercised at any stage of the proceedings, including before the framing of a charge.

The court also noted that the documents sought by the petitioner were relevant to the case and were necessary for the proper disposal of the case. The court held that the Magistrate had erred in dismissing the petition and framing a charge without perusing the documents.

The court further held that the power to summon documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a discretionary power, and that the court must exercise its discretion judiciously. The court held that the Magistrate had failed to exercise his discretion properly in this case.

In conclusion, the court set aside the order of the Magistrate, quashed the charge, and directed the Magistrate to peruse the documents and frame an appropriate charge. The court also emphasized the importance of exercising the power to summon documents under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code judiciously.
