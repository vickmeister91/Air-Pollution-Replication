The court order in question pertains to a case between South Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Madhya Pradesh State Diversity. The case revolves around a notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The respondents' counsel has stated that the notice is going to be withdrawn. 

The petitioners in the case sought permission to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. The court has allowed this prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed. 

The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is an important piece of legislation that seeks to conserve India's rich biodiversity. The Act provides for the establishment of Biodiversity Management Committees at the local level, as well as the National Biodiversity Authority at the national level. The Act also provides for the regulation of access to biological resources and associated knowledge, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their use. 

In this particular case, the notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Act appears to have been the bone of contention. Section 7 of the Act provides for the preparation of a People's Biodiversity Register (PBR) by the Biodiversity Management Committees. The PBR is a comprehensive database of the biological resources available in a particular area, as well as the associated traditional knowledge. 

The notice in question may have been issued by the Biodiversity Board to ensure compliance with the provisions of Section 7. However, it is not clear from the available information what the specific nature of the notice was, or why it is being withdrawn. 

The petitioners in the case sought permission to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. This suggests that they may have been dissatisfied with the outcome of the case, or that they may wish to pursue the matter further in the future. 

The court has allowed the petitioners' prayer, and the petitions have been dismissed as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioners to take recourse of law afresh if needed. This means that the petitioners are free to pursue the matter further if they so choose. 

Overall, the court order in this case appears to be a relatively straightforward one. The notice issued by the Biodiversity Board under Section 7 of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 is going to be withdrawn, and the petitioners have been granted permission to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed. It is not clear from the available information what the specific nature of the notice was, or why it is being withdrawn. However, the court's decision to allow the petitioners to withdraw their petitions with liberty to file afresh if needed suggests that the matter may not be entirely resolved.
