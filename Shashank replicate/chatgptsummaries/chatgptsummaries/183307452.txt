The issue of biomedical waste being dumped in the Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary in Thoothukudi District has been the subject of several court orders. In one instance, a writ petition was filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to remove the waste and conduct an inquiry by an independent agency. The Forest Ranger submitted a report stating that some waste materials were dumped at Padmanabamangalam Village, located 0.9kms away from the sanctuary. The Sub Divisional Magistrate and Sub Collector, Tuticorin, directed the Inspector of Police, Srivaikuntam Police Station, to investigate and file a report. The court did not issue any further orders.

In another court order, the Sub Divisional Magistrate and Sub Collector of Tuticorin directed the Inspector of Police to investigate and file an FIR under relevant sections of IPC regarding the dumping of biomedical waste from foreign countries in the Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary. The Tahsildar was also directed to take steps to remove the waste and submit a consolidated report. The court issued an enquiry notice to the Forest Ranger and the petitioner to appear with relevant documents and proofs. The government pleader confirmed that action had been taken based on the enquiry report.

Another court order pertained to the dumping of biomedical waste from foreign countries near Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary in Thoothukudi District. The Forest Range Officer submitted a report stating that waste materials were dumped at Padmanabamangalam Village, which is located near the sanctuary. The court instructed the authorities to file an FIR under relevant sections of IPC and submit a report. Additionally, they were directed to remove the waste materials in coordination with the concerned BDO.

In yet another court order, a writ petition was filed regarding biomedical waste dumped in Padmanabamangalam Village in Srivaikuntam Taluk. The Forest Range Officer reported that a few loads of waste materials were dumped in the village, and the Inspector of Police was directed to file an FIR and investigate the matter. The Block Development Officer was also directed to coordinate with the concerned authorities and submit a consolidated report. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 was cited, and the penalties for contravention of its provisions were outlined. The section dealing with offences committed by companies was also mentioned.

The court orders also highlighted the regulations for the handling and disposal of bio-medical waste, including the use of compliant bags for storage and transportation, proper segregation and labeling, and pre-treatment of certain types of waste. The order also required the maintenance of records and compliance with rules for the handling of mercury and lead waste.

One court order stated that if a company commits an offense under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, then the person in charge of the company at the time of the offense will also be held responsible and punished accordingly. The same applies to government departments. The Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016, define the duties of the occupier and operator of a common Bio-Medical Waste treatment and disposal facility. The rules state that bio-medical waste must be treated and disposed of in accordance with Schedule I and II, and the occupier must hand over segregated waste to a common bio-medical waste treatment facility for treatment and processing. The rules also prohibit the use of non-chlorinated plastic bags for storing and transporting bio-medical waste.

In one court order, a joint inspection was conducted by various officials regarding the dumping of bio-medical waste from foreign countries in the Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary. It was found that shredded and crushed plastic waste materials were dumped in private patta lands in Padmanabamangalam village, which is not part of the sanctuary. The investigation is still ongoing to identify the culprits who dumped the waste. The Inspector of Police filed a status report stating that a case has been filed for the offenses under Sections 269 and 270 of IPC and investigation is ongoing. Samples of the waste were collected during inspection and photographs were submitted for the court's perusal.

Finally, one court order stated that plastic waste materials were dumped on private land in Padmanabamangalam Village, Sri Vaikundam Taluk, and a case had been registered for the offenses under Section 269 and 270 of IPC. The waste materials were not bio-medical wastes as alleged by the petitioner. The court dismissed the writ petition and there shall be no order as to cost. The order was sent to the Secretary to Government, Home Department, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, and the District Collector of Tuticorin District.

In conclusion, the court orders highlight the issue of biomedical waste being dumped in the Vallanadu Wildlife Sanctuary and the steps taken by the authorities to investigate and address the issue. The orders also emphasize the importance of complying with regulations for the handling and disposal of bio-medical waste and the penalties for contravention of these regulations. The ongoing investigation into the dumping of waste from foreign countries underscores the need for greater vigilance and enforcement to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.
