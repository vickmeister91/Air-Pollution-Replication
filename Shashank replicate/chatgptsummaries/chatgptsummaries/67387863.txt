Kailasiya Botham, also known as Chachcha, has been granted temporary bail until May 1, 2018, by a court in India. The reason for the bail is his son's upcoming wedding. Botham is facing trial for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. However, he must surrender to custody on May 2, 2018, and provide a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with a solvent surety in the same amount. The court will consider his application for regular bail on May 4, 2018.

The Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, is an Indian law that provides for the protection of wild animals and plants. The act prohibits hunting, poaching, and trading of wild animals and plants. It also provides for the establishment of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and conservation reserves.

Kailasiya Botham's case is related to the violation of this act. The details of the offense are not clear, but it is likely that he was involved in some form of illegal hunting or trading of wild animals or plants. The offense is serious, and if convicted, Botham could face imprisonment and a fine.

However, the court has granted him temporary bail on the grounds of his son's upcoming wedding. This is a common practice in India, where courts often grant temporary bail to accused persons on humanitarian grounds. The court has also set conditions for the bail, which Botham must comply with. He must surrender to custody on May 2, 2018, and provide a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with a solvent surety in the same amount.

The personal bond is a legal document that Botham must sign, which states that he will appear in court on the specified dates and comply with all the conditions of the bail. The solvent surety is a person who guarantees that Botham will comply with the conditions of the bail. The surety must also provide proof of his or her financial solvency.

The court has also set a date for the hearing of Botham's application for regular bail. This is a positive development for Botham, as it indicates that the court is willing to consider his case for bail. However, it is important to note that the court has not yet granted him regular bail. Botham must still prove to the court that he is not a flight risk and that he will comply with all the conditions of the bail.

In conclusion, Kailasiya Botham has been granted temporary bail until May 1, 2018, on the grounds of his son's upcoming wedding. He must surrender to custody on May 2, 2018, and provide a personal bond of Rs.50,000/- with a solvent surety in the same amount. The court will consider his application for regular bail on May 4, 2018. Botham is facing trial for an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and if convicted, he could face imprisonment and a fine. The court's decision to grant him temporary bail is a positive development for Botham, but he must still prove his innocence in court.
