The court order in question deals with two important questions in a criminal revision petition. The first question is whether sanction is required for prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947. The second question is whether sanction is required for the prosecution of an accused public servant under Section 5 of that Act even when the accused person had ceased to be a public servant on the date of the taking cognizance of the offence by the Special Judge.

The court concludes that no sanction is required under Section 6 for prosecuting an accused public servant before a Special Judge when he has ceased to be a public servant on the date of taking cognizance of the offence. This means that even if the accused person is no longer a public servant, they can still be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The court also rules that a second sanction under Section 197 of the Code is not required, as the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special Act, the provisions of which will override the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This means that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act take precedence over the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court order further states that the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special statute and its provisions cannot be overridden by the general provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This means that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act must be followed even if they conflict with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The court also mentions that a specific sanction is required under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. This means that before a public servant can be prosecuted under the Prevention of Corruption Act, a sanction must be obtained from the appropriate authority.

The court dismisses the Criminal Revision Petition and states that the want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code is not a bar for the offense under Section 120B of the Penal Code. This means that even if there is no sanction under Section 197 of the Code, the accused person can still be prosecuted under Section 120B of the Penal Code.

In summary, the court order clarifies that no sanction is required under Section 6 for prosecuting an accused public servant before a Special Judge when he has ceased to be a public servant on the date of taking cognizance of the offence. It also states that a second sanction under Section 197 of the Code is not required, as the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special Act, the provisions of which will override the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The court further emphasizes that the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act must be followed even if they conflict with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Finally, the court dismisses the Criminal Revision Petition and clarifies that the want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code is not a bar for the offense under Section 120B of the Penal Code.
