In the first court order, A. Venkateswari Amma and others filed a writ petition challenging the non-renewal of lease of forest land for agricultural purposes after the expiry of the lease in 1999. The legal issues considered in this case were whether Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act 1980 places a total prohibition on renewal and whether Central Government clearance is required for renewal. The court provided a brief description of the sequence of events and previous judgments related to the case. Ultimately, the court dismissed the writ petition.

Moving on to the second court order, the case involved a dispute over the renewal of a lease for forest land, with the petitioners arguing that they were not aware of the proceedings and were not heard by the respondents. The court directed the concerned respondent to consider and pass appropriate orders in all pending matters, while also prohibiting any construction, cultivation, or cutting of trees. The court found that the government has the right to decide whether to renew the lease and that the policy is not to renew any forest leases. The Forest Conservation Act allows for granting forest land on lease or renewal with prior approval from the Central Government. The court cited a previous decision stating that there is no vested right for renewal and that it can only be granted with approval from the Central Government.

Lastly, the third court order pertained to a case where the State Government rejected an application for renewal of a lease for non-forest purposes. The petitioner alleged violation of natural justice and non-service of copy of proceedings. The court held that the State Government is not obligated to seek approval from the Central Government for renewal and that the petitioner had already availed the benefit granted by the court in a previous judgment. The court dismissed the writ petition.

In all three court orders, the issue at hand was the renewal of leases for forest land. The Forest Conservation Act 1980 plays a crucial role in determining whether such leases can be renewed or not. The act allows for granting forest land on lease or renewal with prior approval from the Central Government. However, the court has made it clear that there is no vested right for renewal and that it can only be granted with approval from the Central Government.
