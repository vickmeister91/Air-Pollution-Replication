The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to the issue of encroachment and unauthorized occupation of forest land in the state of Kerala, India. The first order examines the legality of granting pattas/leasehold rights to such occupants without prior approval from the Central Government. The court reviews the history of forest regulations in Kerala and notes a letter from the Agricultural Production Commissioner and Secretary (Agriculture and Forests) of the Government of Kerala requesting the Central Government to permit regularization of such occupation/encroachment by issue of title deeds under the Kerala Land Assignment Rules.

The second order pertains to the regularization of pre-1.1.1977 encroachments of forest land in Kerala. The State Government had proposed to assign lands to occupants of forest areas that had already been converted for agricultural purposes. The Central Government granted conditional approval subject to certain conditions, including ground verification and demarcation of the area to be regularized, preparation of a comprehensive scheme for soil conservation and agroforestry, and provision of funds for compensatory afforestation. The appellant, a society formed for protection of environment and ecology, challenged the decision of the government to regularize unauthorised occupation/encroachment of forest lands, claiming that it would adversely affect the environment and wildlife.

The third order discusses a case regarding the regularization of encroachments made on forest land in the State of Kerala. The State Government argues that due to population pressure and various schemes, forest lands have been converted into agricultural holdings and human settlements, and it is impossible to evict the occupants. The Central Government has approved the use of forest land for non-forest purposes, subject to certain conditions. The Full Bench of the High Court held that the petitioner has the locus to challenge the decision to regularize encroachments, but the 1980 Act is not applicable to cases where forest land has already been used for non-forest purposes prior to 25.10.1980. The court also held that the scheme for compensatory afforestation satisfies the conditions imposed by the Central Government, and the decision to grant pattas/leasehold rights to pre-1.1.1977 unauthorized occupants/encroachers of forest land did not involve any violation of constitutional or legal provisions. The court also emphasized the need for compensation for the injury caused to the general public by using forest land for non-forest purposes. The court heard arguments from various parties and ultimately upheld the decision to regularize encroachments subject to certain conditions.

The fourth order declares that a piece of land is proposed to be constituted as a Reserved Forest and appoints a Forest Settlement Officer to determine any rights claimed by individuals over the land or forest produce. During the period between the notification and the fixed date, no rights can be acquired over the land except through a grant or contract made by the government or a person with the power to do so. No clearing or cutting of forest produce is allowed without permission from the Forest Settlement Officer. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 prohibits the de-reservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purposes without prior approval from the Central Government. The act also establishes penalties for contravention of its provisions. The regularisation of encroachments on forest land is discussed, with criteria given for proposals seeking prior approval under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.

The fifth order discusses the conditions for regularization of encroachments on forest land before 25.10.1980. The State Government can only regularize encroachments that fulfill the eligibility criteria laid down before 25.10.1980 and were not implemented due to the enactment of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The court also discusses the provisions of the 1961 and 1980 Acts related to the use of forest land for non-forest purposes and the requirement of prior approval from the Central Government. The court distinguishes two cases related to the renewal of leases for mining operations and concludes that the prior approval of the Central Government is necessary for any use of forest land for non-forest purposes after the enforcement of the 1980 Act.

The sixth order states that the Forest Conservation Act of 1980 applies to all forests, regardless of ownership or classification, and that no non-forest activity can be carried out without prior approval from the Central Government. The order also clarifies that the State Government cannot seek approval for activities that it has already concluded should not be granted. The order upholds the policy decision of the Government of Kerala to assign forest land to unauthorized occupants/encroachers after seeking approval from the Central Government. However, the State Government must obtain prior approval from the Central Government before assigning any forest land for non-forest purposes.

The seventh order does not provide any information about its content or subject.

Overall, these court orders highlight the complex legal and environmental issues surrounding the use and occupation of forest land in Kerala. While the State Government has sought to regularize encroachments and assign land to occupants, the Central Government has imposed strict conditions and requirements for such actions, including compensatory afforestation and prior approval for non-forest use. The courts have upheld some of these policies and decisions, while also emphasizing the need for compensation and protection of the environment and wildlife.
