The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to consider the representations made by M/S Balaji Minerals and take appropriate action by inspecting the unit and taking a decision within six weeks. The order was passed on 22nd September 2021 by a bench comprising of Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, Chairperson, and Dr. Nagin Nanda, Judicial Member.

The case pertains to the closure of M/S Balaji Minerals, a mining unit located in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. The unit was closed by the TNPCB on 30th June 2021, citing violations of environmental norms. The closure was challenged by M/S Balaji Minerals before the NGT, which had earlier directed the TNPCB to consider the representations made by the applicant and take appropriate action.

In its latest order, the NGT has directed the TNPCB to inspect the unit and take a decision within six weeks. If the TNPCB fails to act upon and take a decision within the stipulated time, the applicant is at liberty to operate the unit. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has been directed to restore electricity and power supply to the unit in such a scenario.

However, if the decision made by the TNPCB is against the applicant, they may work out remedies as available under the law. The NGT has also directed the applicant to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 10 lakhs to the TNPCB as a condition for operating the unit.

The NGT has observed that the closure of the unit has resulted in the loss of employment for around 200 workers and has caused financial hardship to the applicant. The NGT has also noted that the TNPCB has not conducted any inspection of the unit before ordering its closure.

The NGT has directed the TNPCB to conduct a joint inspection of the unit along with the applicant and submit a report within four weeks. The NGT has also directed the TNPCB to consider the report of the joint inspection while taking a decision on the closure of the unit.

The NGT has further directed the TNPCB to ensure that the unit complies with all environmental norms and regulations. The NGT has also directed the applicant to submit an undertaking to this effect.

The NGT has observed that the closure of the unit has resulted in the loss of revenue for the state government and has also affected the supply of raw materials to various industries. The NGT has directed the TNPCB to take a balanced view while considering the closure of the unit.

In conclusion, the NGT has ordered the TNPCB to consider the representations made by M/S Balaji Minerals and take appropriate action by inspecting the unit and taking a decision within six weeks. The NGT has also directed the applicant to furnish a bank guarantee of Rs. 10 lakhs to the TNPCB as a condition for operating the unit. The NGT has further directed the TNPCB to ensure that the unit complies with all environmental norms and regulations.
