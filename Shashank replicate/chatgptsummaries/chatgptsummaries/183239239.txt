The court's decision to grant bail to Ashok Mehra was based on several factors. First, the court considered the limited role that Mehra played in the alleged crime. The prosecution alleged that Mehra had looted a tiger skin from co-accused persons Prakash and Ganna, who were taking it on a motor-cycle to one Sitaram Maharaj. However, the tiger skin was not recovered from the possession of the petitioner and it was later on seized abandoned near a Government Hand Pump. The court found that Mehra's role in the crime was limited and that he was not the primary perpetrator.

Second, the court considered the fact that Mehra had been in custody since 07.11.2016. This meant that he had already spent a significant amount of time in jail awaiting trial. The court recognized that prolonged pre-trial detention can be detrimental to an accused person's mental and physical health, as well as their ability to mount a defense. Therefore, the court found that it was appropriate to grant Mehra bail.

Finally, the court required Mehra to furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/- with one solvent surety in the same amount. This ensured that Mehra would be financially responsible for his actions and would have an incentive to appear in court for his trial. The court's decision to grant bail to Mehra was based on a careful consideration of the facts of the case and the relevant legal principles.

In conclusion, the court's decision to grant bail to Ashok Mehra in a case related to the killing of a tiger and a pangolin was based on several factors. The court considered the limited role that Mehra played in the alleged crime, the fact that he had been in custody since 07.11.2016, and the requirement that he furnish a personal bond in the sum of Rs.40,000/- with one solvent surety in the same amount. The court's decision was a careful balancing of the interests of justice and the rights of the accused person.
