The first court order involves a case between M/S Capital Bus Service (P) Ltd. and the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner's buses were granted stage carriage permits by the State Transport Authority of the Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Traffic) started challaning the buses on the ground of overtaking and picking up/dropping passengers without a valid bus stop. The petitioner chose to compound the same by paying fines ranging from Rs. 2500/- to Rs. 5100/-. The petitioner filed a writ petition stating that the acts of the respondents were arbitrary and unjustified and violated his fundamental rights. The court dismissed the petition and held that the show-cause notices issued to the petitioner were legal and valid.

The second court order discusses the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the M.C. Mehta case regarding the operation of heavy and medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles in Delhi. The directions include fitting speed control devices, not overtaking other vehicles, confining buses to designated lanes, and halting only at designated bus stops. The court acknowledges concerns about possible abuse of power by the traffic police in enforcing these directions, but also notes that the police have no discretion in the matter as the directions are implied conditions of every permit. The court also references a subsequent judgment in the UPSRTC case that clarifies and modifies some of the directions issued in M.C. Mehta.

The third court order pertains to the case of Mehta v. UOI and directs traffic police to treat the direction as implied conditions of every permit and take action accordingly. The court suggests seeking clarifications from the Supreme Court regarding a subsequent judgment in the UPSRTC case. The court notes that there is no stay on an appeal filed against the judgment of the Tara Kant Jha case and that the matter will be taken up in due course. The court also acknowledges that the interim directions are causing hardship to the respondents but upholds the binding nature of the Tara Kant Jha judgment and disposes of the petition and pending application accordingly.

In summary, the court orders relate to the regulation of transport vehicles in Delhi.

The court dismissed the petition and held that the show-cause notices issued to the petitioner were legal and valid. The second order discusses the directions issued by the Supreme Court in the M.C. Mehta case regarding the operation of heavy and medium transport vehicles and light goods vehicles in Delhi. The third order pertains to the case of Mehta v.
