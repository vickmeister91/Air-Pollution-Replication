The Madras High Court has issued a court order in response to a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the closure of an Aqua Culture Industry in Nadukuppam Village, Marakkanam Taluk, Villupuram District. The PIL was filed on the grounds that the industry was causing health hazards to the villagers and was operating without the necessary permissions. The area in question is located in Kazuveli wetland and is classified as a protected wetland.

The court order mandates two actions to be taken. Firstly, the entitlement to hold the land must be verified, and an expedited demarcation process must be carried out. Secondly, if no valid license is found to be in existence, the prawn culture activity must be stopped. The compliance report for these actions is to be filed within two months from the date of receipt of the court order.

The court's decision to issue this order is based on the fact that the Aqua Culture Industry is operating in a protected wetland area without the necessary permissions. The court has recognized the importance of protecting wetlands and the need to prevent activities that could cause harm to the environment and the health of the local population.

The order is significant as it highlights the importance of protecting wetlands and the need for industries to obtain the necessary permissions before operating in such areas. The court's decision to order the verification of entitlement to hold the land and the expedited demarcation process is a step towards ensuring that industries operate within the legal framework and do not cause harm to the environment or the local population.

The court's decision to order the closure of the Aqua Culture Industry if no valid license is found to be in existence is a clear message to industries that they must comply with the law and obtain the necessary permissions before operating. This decision is in line with the government's efforts to promote sustainable development and protect the environment.

The court order is a positive step towards protecting the environment and ensuring that industries operate within the legal framework. It is important for industries to recognize the importance of protecting the environment and to take steps to minimize their impact on the environment and the local population. The court's decision to issue this order is a reminder that industries must comply with the law and obtain the necessary permissions before operating in protected areas.
