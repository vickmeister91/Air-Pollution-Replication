The court order pertains to a civil suit involving allegations made by the plaintiff against two police officials, defendant No. 5 (R.S. Yadav) and defendant No. 6 (Mr. Ranjit Narayan), regarding false accusations and subsequent legal action against the plaintiff and his family. The defendants sought rejection of their names from the array of parties, but the plaintiff argued that the allegations against them were sufficient and demonstrated malafide actions leading to the issuance of a Red Corner Notice/RCN against the plaintiff.

The court heard arguments from both sides and reserved its decision. The plaintiff's counsel argued that the allegations in the plaint should be read alongside judicial findings, which make out a cause of action against the defendants. The defendants' counsel argued that the acts were done in discharge of their duty and that the bar under Section 140 of the Act is attracted.

The court evaluated whether the plaint discloses a cause of action against the defendants and whether the bar under the provisions of law which is Section 140 of the Act is attracted or not. The court cited settled principles of law guiding the court while deciding the application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. The court evaluated the allegations made in the plaint concerning defendant No. 6 and concluded that there exists some error insofar as the reference of defendant No. 6 in the plaint is concerned. The court proceeded to evaluate the allegations raised in the plaint concerning Mr. Ranjeet Narayan as defendant No. 6 and concluded that the plaint discloses a cause of action against him.

The court found that the allegations against defendant No. 6 fell within the scope of his duty as a police official, while the allegations against defendant No. 5 did not. The court dismissed a motion filed by defendant No. 5 and allowed a motion filed by defendant No. 6. The plaintiff was directed to file an amended memo of the parties within two weeks.

The court order also stated that the case with reference number CS (OS) No.2315/2011 would be presented before the Roster Bench on April 22, 2015, and the judge presiding over the case is Manmohan Singh. The order was issued on February 20, 2015, and is the last page of a 27-page document.

The court evaluated whether the plaint discloses a cause of action against the defendants and whether the bar under the provisions of law which is Section 140 of the Act is attracted or not.
