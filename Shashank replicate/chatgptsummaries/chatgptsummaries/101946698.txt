Romesh Sharma, a businessman, was convicted and sentenced to three years of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh for possessing tiger, leopard, and cheetal (deer) skins without proper documentation under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. Sharma filed an appeal to set aside the judgment, claiming that the evidence was not correctly appreciated, and the skins were fake. However, the court rejected Sharma's appeal, stating that the prosecution's witnesses were competent to identify the skins' genuineness.

The court order states that the appellant's attempt to raise doubt about the testimony of one witness was unsuccessful, and that the testimonies of two other witnesses confirmed the authenticity of the recovered skins. The court also notes that the appellant's defense was contradictory and unsupported by evidence. As a result, the court upholds the appellant's conviction for violating wildlife protection laws.

The case against Sharma was initiated in 1995 when the police raided his residence and found the skins of a tiger, a leopard, and a cheetal. The police also found a large number of firearms and ammunition. Sharma was arrested and charged under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and the Arms Act, 1959. The trial court found Sharma guilty of violating the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and sentenced him to three years of simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 lakh. However, he was acquitted of the charges under the Arms Act, 1959.

Sharma filed an appeal against the conviction under the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, in the Delhi High Court. He argued that the prosecution had failed to prove that the skins recovered from his residence were genuine and that the witnesses produced by the prosecution were not competent to identify the skins' genuineness. He also argued that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence and that his defense had not been properly considered.

The Delhi High Court rejected Sharma's appeal and upheld his conviction. The court noted that the prosecution had produced three witnesses who were competent to identify the skins' genuineness. The court also noted that Sharma's defense was contradictory and unsupported by evidence. The court observed that Sharma had initially claimed that the skins were fake, but later changed his defense and claimed that he had obtained the skins from a person who had assured him that they were obtained legally. The court found this defense to be unsupported by evidence.

The court also rejected Sharma's argument that the trial court had not correctly appreciated the evidence. The court noted that the trial court had considered all the evidence produced by the prosecution and had given reasons for accepting the prosecution's case. The court observed that the trial court had also considered Sharma's defense and had given reasons for rejecting it.

In conclusion, the Delhi High Court upheld Romesh Sharma's conviction for violating wildlife protection laws. The court rejected Sharma's appeal, stating that the prosecution's witnesses were competent to identify the skins' genuineness and that Sharma's defense was contradictory and unsupported by evidence. The court also noted that the trial court had correctly appreciated the evidence and had given reasons for accepting the prosecution's case. The judgment serves as a reminder that wildlife protection laws are essential for preserving India's rich biodiversity and that violators will be punished.
