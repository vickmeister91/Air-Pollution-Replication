The Madhya Pradesh High Court recently heard a case brought by the M.P. Rice Mills Association against the State of M.P. and the M.P. Pradushan Niwaran Mandal. The Association sought a writ of prohibition to prevent the enforcement of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1978 and the Rules framed thereunder by the State of M.P. The Association argued that the Act did not authorize the State Government to charge consent fees or license fees, and that the Rules were ultra vires.

The Court considered the Act's purpose of preventing and controlling water pollution and maintaining the wholesomeness of water, and the establishment of Boards for the prevention and control of water pollution. The Court ultimately found that the State Government had the authority to prescribe regulatory measures, including the charging of consent and license fees, and that the Rules were not ultra vires.

The court order pertains to a case involving the abatement of water pollution and the levying of consent and license fees by the State Government. The court held that the State Government was competent to frame rules prescribing consent fees, and that the license fees were a yearly renewal for the consent granted. The court also rejected the petitioner's argument that the mills were not covered under the Act and Rules, and that no standard had been fixed by the Pollution Board to lay down the degree of pollution caused by the industry.

Finally, the court held that the collection of consent and license fees was not illegal or unjustified, as it had a broad, reasonable, and general co-relationship with the resultant benefit to the class of people on which the fee was levied.
