The court order in question pertains to a case filed under the Wild Life (Protection) Act against Sushila Jain for contravention of provisions. The accused had filed a quashing petition, which was rejected by the High Court. The accused were in possession of ivory articles, and the court directed them to produce the case property failing which they would have to deposit a cost of Rs. 50,000 and show cause as to why the case property should not be ordered to be deposited with the Wildlife Department during the pending trial. The case is still at the stage of pre-charge evidence.

The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Act of the Parliament of India enacted for the protection of plants and animal species. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds, and plants, and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. The Act prohibits hunting of wild animals, birds, and plants, and also provides for the establishment of national parks, sanctuaries, and other protected areas.
