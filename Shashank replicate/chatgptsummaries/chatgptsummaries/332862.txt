The Delhi High Court recently issued a court order that pertains to seven petitions related to deforestation and the use of land for residential and commercial purposes versus afforestation for the preservation of the environment. The challenge is to the steps taken by the government pursuant to a notification issued in 1996, which directed the exclusion of uncultivated surplus land of Gaon Sabha falling in "Ridge" from vesting in Gaon Sabha and making it available for the purpose of creation of Reserved Forest. The petitioners argue that the land mentioned in the notification was already built upon even prior to the orders of the Supreme Court.

The court heard arguments from both sides and described the land subject matter of each petition. The court also noted that the Supreme Court's order was concerned with preserving the green area to provide a lung to the ever-increasing population of the city of Delhi. The court also noted that the land subject to the notification is required to be afforested by removing all encroachment, structures, etc. existing thereon.

The court dismissed all the petitions and directed the respondents to take possession of the land by removing all encroachments/constructions thereon. The court allowed reporters to see the judgment and for it to be reported in the Digest.
