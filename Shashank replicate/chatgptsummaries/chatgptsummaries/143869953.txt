The Rajasthan High Court recently passed a significant order in a bunch of petitions filed by the State of Rajasthan and others against the Collector of Bundi and others. The issue at hand was related to the alteration of boundaries of the Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary. The court held that the Collector had no power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary and the impugned orders passed by him are liable to be set aside. 

The Ramgarh Wildlife Sanctuary is located in the district of Bundi in Rajasthan and is spread over an area of approximately 252 sq km. The sanctuary is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including tigers, leopards, sloth bears, and various species of birds. The sanctuary is also an important source of water for the surrounding areas and is a crucial part of the ecosystem.

The issue of the alteration of boundaries of the sanctuary arose when the Collector of Bundi issued orders in 2016 and 2017, which sought to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary. The orders were challenged by various individuals and organizations, including the State of Rajasthan, on the grounds that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, held that the Collector did not have the power to alter the boundaries of the sanctuary. The court relied on the provisions of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, which provides for the establishment of sanctuaries and the procedure for altering the boundaries of such sanctuaries. The court held that the Collector had not followed the procedure laid down in the Act and had acted beyond his powers.

The court also held that the impugned orders passed by the Collector were liable to be set aside. The court observed that the orders were passed without considering the objections filed by the respondents in terms of Section 19 of the Act. Section 19 provides for the procedure for considering objections to the proposal for the alteration of the boundaries of a sanctuary. The court held that the Collector had not followed the procedure laid down in Section 19 and had acted arbitrarily.

The court, therefore, remanded the matter to the Collector to reconsider afresh the objections filed by the respondents in terms of Section 19 of the Act. The court directed the Collector to follow the procedure laid down in the Act and to consider the objections filed by the respondents before passing any orders altering the boundaries of the sanctuary.

The court's order is significant as it reaffirms the importance of following the procedure laid down in the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972, while altering the boundaries of sanctuaries. The order also highlights the need to protect the environment and the ecosystem, which are crucial for the survival of various species of flora and fauna. The court's order is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the protection of the environment and the conservation of wildlife.
