The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by two individuals, Hari and another person, under Section 439Cr.P.C. for a forest crime registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court allowed the bail application, but with certain stringent conditions that the petitioners must comply with.

The first condition of the bail was a personal bond of Rs. 50,000/-, which the petitioners were required to furnish. Additionally, they were also required to provide two solvent sureties of Rs. 25,000/- each. These conditions were put in place to ensure that the petitioners would not abscond or fail to appear before the court when required.

The court also directed the petitioners to comply with all the terms and conditions of the bond, cooperate in the investigation/trial, not commit a similar offence, not seek unnecessary adjournments during the trial, and mark their presence before the concerned trial court once every fortnight till disposal of the trial. These conditions were put in place to ensure that the petitioners would not interfere with the investigation or trial, and that they would remain available for the duration of the trial.

It is important to note that the court order will remain operative subject to compliance with these conditions. This means that if the petitioners fail to comply with any of the conditions set forth by the court, the bail may be revoked and they may be taken into custody.

Overall, the court order in this case serves as a reminder that bail is not a right, but a privilege that is granted under certain conditions. The court has the power to impose stringent conditions on bail to ensure that the accused does not abscond or interfere with the investigation or trial. It is up to the accused to comply with these conditions if they wish to remain out on bail.
