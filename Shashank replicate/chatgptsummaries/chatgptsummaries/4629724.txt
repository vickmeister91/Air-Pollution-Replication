The court order pertains to two separate cases of violations of statutory rules and regulations in Himachal Pradesh. The first case involves a challenge laid by Hotel Back Packers Inn against a notice issued by the H.P. State Pollution Control Board. The court passed an order on June 23, 2017, directing the petitioner to file an affidavit stating the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The court also directed that no coercive action shall be taken till the next date of hearing. The petitioner filed a personal affidavit stating the above details.

The second case pertains to a violation of the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act, where the extent of construction carried out by the petitioner was almost 300% more than the sanctioned plan. The court ordered the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that in the event of the vires of the amendment incorporated in the Act being struck down, the petitioner shall demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanction plans and beyond compoundable limits. The petitioner was also ordered to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner sought permission to withdraw the writ petition, which was permitted subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposed of the writ petition as having been withdrawn.

In the first case, the court order directs the petitioner to provide an affidavit with specific details regarding the extent of construction permissible as per the sanctioned plan, the extent of construction actually carried out, deviation made in actual construction, the extent of construction which is otherwise compoundable, and an undertaking to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws. The court also orders that no coercive action shall be taken until the next date of hearing. The petitioner complies with the order by filing a personal affidavit with the required details.

In the second case, the court order pertains to a violation of the Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act, where the extent of construction carried out by the petitioner was almost 300% more than the sanctioned plan. The court orders the petitioner to furnish an undertaking that in the event of the vires of the amendment incorporated in the Act being struck down, the petitioner shall demolish the construction raised in excess of the sanction plans and beyond compoundable limits. The petitioner is also ordered to comply with all other statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws under the provisions of the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The petitioner seeks permission to withdraw the writ petition, which is granted subject to the petitioner depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. The court disposes of the writ petition as having been withdrawn.

In both cases, the court orders the petitioners to comply with all statutory rules/regulations/bye-laws and provides specific directions for doing so. The court also takes into account the potential consequences of non-compliance, such as coercive action and demolition of excess construction. The court allows the petitioner in the second case to withdraw the writ petition, but only after depositing a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs as costs to be deposited with the H.P. State Legal Services Authority. Overall, the court orders serve to enforce compliance with statutory rules and regulations and ensure that violators are held accountable for their actions.
