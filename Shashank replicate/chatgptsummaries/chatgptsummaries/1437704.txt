The court order in question pertains to a civil application for stay filed by Jatimran Salim and six others against the Union of India and 12 others. The petitioners had produced photographs with the affidavit of petitioner no.6, and the court had directed the respondents to file affidavits-in-reply to the petition and to specifically deal with the photographs.

After the concerned respondents filed their affidavits, the court found no reason to disbelieve the averments and statements made before the court and in the affidavits filed on behalf of the authorities. As a result, the court disposed of the civil application with the observation that if the applicants find that the respondents are acting contrary to the provisions of law, it is always open for the applicants to approach the statutory authorities under the above-mentioned legislations.

The court's decision was based on the evidence presented before it, and it found no reason to doubt the veracity of the respondents' affidavits. The court's decision also highlights the importance of approaching statutory authorities if there is a suspicion of wrongdoing, as this is the appropriate course of action in such cases.

Overall, the court's decision in this case serves as a reminder of the importance of following due process and approaching the appropriate authorities when there is a suspicion of wrongdoing. It also underscores the importance of presenting evidence in court and ensuring that all parties have an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against them.
