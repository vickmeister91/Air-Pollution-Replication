Two court orders have been summarized in the given text. The first order pertains to a petitioner who filed a petition seeking direction to allot an alternate industrial plot to him under the relocation scheme in lieu of closure of his unit. The petitioner's application was rejected as he failed to provide documents to prove that the petitioner was consuming power exceeding 5 K.W. during the period prior to 19.04.1996 and was a functional unit prior to the said date. The court considered whether the petition is barred by time and latches and whether the petitioner was entitled to be considered for an alternative plot in a conforming area. The court found that the petitioner cannot claim ignorance of the refund of earnest money and dismissed the petition.

The second court order states that the petitioner cannot claim ignorance of the refund of earnest money as they were aware of the rejection of their application. The petitioner's case is based on seeking parity with other similarly placed persons who were treated differently. The decision to extend benefits to units from local commercial areas was taken on 26.06.2006, and the petitioner can seek parity with other similarly placed units. The petitioner's application was rejected in conformity with the policy at the material time, but certain units were not rejected and kept pending. The petitioner's grievance appears to be justified, and they should be treated at par with other applicants whose units were functioning in local commercial areas. The petitioner must deposit the earnest money along with interest with the respondent, and subject to the deposit being made, they shall be treated at par with 82 applicants mentioned in the Cabinet decision dated 26.06.2006.

In the first court order, the petitioner had filed a petition seeking direction to allot an alternate industrial plot to him under the relocation scheme in lieu of closure of his unit. However, the petitioner's application was rejected as he failed to provide documents to prove that the petitioner was consuming power exceeding 5 K.W. during the period prior to 19.04.1996 and was a functional unit prior to the said date. The court considered whether the petition is barred by time and latches and whether the petitioner was entitled to be considered for an alternative plot in a conforming area. The court found that the petitioner cannot claim ignorance of the refund of earnest money and dismissed the petition.

The court's decision was based on the fact that the petitioner failed to provide the necessary documents to prove that their unit was functional prior to 19.04.1996 and was consuming power exceeding 5 K.W. during that period. The court also found that the petitioner cannot claim ignorance of the refund of earnest money, which was available to them. Therefore, the court dismissed the petition.

In the second court order, the petitioner's case was based on seeking parity with other similarly placed persons who were treated differently. The decision to extend benefits to units from local commercial areas was taken on 26.06.2006, and the petitioner can seek parity with other similarly placed units. The petitioner's application was rejected in conformity with the policy at the material time, but certain units were not rejected and kept pending.

The court found that the petitioner's grievance appears to be justified, and they should be treated at par with other applicants whose units were functioning in local commercial areas. The petitioner must deposit the earnest money along with interest with the respondent, and subject to the deposit being made, they shall be treated at par with 82 applicants mentioned in the Cabinet decision dated 26.06.2006.

In conclusion, the two court orders pertain to different cases. The first order pertains to a petitioner who failed to provide the necessary documents to prove that their unit was functional prior to 19.04.1996 and was consuming power exceeding 5 K.W. during that period. The court dismissed the petition as the petitioner cannot claim ignorance of the refund of earnest money. The second order pertains to a petitioner who sought parity with other similarly placed persons who were treated differently. The court found that the petitioner's grievance appears to be justified, and they should be treated at par with other applicants whose units were functioning in local commercial areas. The petitioner must deposit the earnest money along with interest with the respondent, and subject to the deposit being made, they shall be treated at par with 82 applicants mentioned in the Cabinet decision dated 26.06.2006.
