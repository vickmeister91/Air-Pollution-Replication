The High Court of Madhya Pradesh recently passed a court order in a case related to the interim custody of two Samsung mobiles seized by forest officials in a case registered under the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The petitioner had filed an application under Section 451/457 of Cr.P.C. for getting interim custody of the seized mobiles, but the trial court and revisional court had rejected the application on the grounds that the seized property shall be the property of the State Government.

The petitioner then filed a petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Second Additional Sessions Judge, Balaghat in Criminal Revision No.7/2018. The High Court of Madhya Pradesh heard the petition and ruled that there was no evidence to show that confiscation proceedings had been initiated and that the trial court cannot deny interim custody of the seized property solely on the basis of Section 39 of the Wild Life Protection Act.

The court order states that seized property will be the property of the state government at this stage. However, the court also cites a previous case where the magistrate was allowed to grant interim release of seized property to its owner during the criminal case. The court believes that the mobile phones seized in this case should be released to the owner, as keeping them idle for too long could damage them.

The court order sets conditions for the release of the mobile phones, including producing them before the trial court when directed, not using them for unlawful purposes, and not changing their appearance. The previous orders by the trial court and revisional court are set aside.

The court order is significant as it clarifies the legal position on the interim custody of seized property in cases related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has held that the trial court cannot deny interim custody of the seized property solely on the basis of Section 39 of the Act, and that the magistrate can grant interim release of seized property to its owner during the criminal case.

The court has also emphasized the importance of preserving the seized property, especially in cases related to electronic devices like mobile phones. The court has set conditions for the release of the mobile phones to ensure that they are not used for unlawful purposes and that their appearance is not changed.

In conclusion, the court order passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in this case is a significant development in the legal position on the interim custody of seized property in cases related to the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The court has clarified that the trial court cannot deny interim custody of the seized property solely on the basis of Section 39 of the Act, and that the magistrate can grant interim release of seized property to its owner during the criminal case. The court has also emphasized the importance of preserving the seized property, especially in cases related to electronic devices like mobile phones, and has set conditions for the release of the mobile phones to ensure that they are not used for unlawful purposes and that their appearance is not changed.
