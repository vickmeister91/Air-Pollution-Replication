The case in question involves a petition filed by the petitioner under section 482 of Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the Special Judge, NDPS Act, Neemuch. The petitioner had previously filed an application under sections 91, 92 of Cr.PC and section 65-B of the I.T Act, requesting the call details of the police personnel who apprehended him in order to prove his innocence. However, this application was rejected by the Special Judge.

The petitioner then filed a petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C., seeking to challenge the order passed by the Special Judge. The petitioner argued that the call details were crucial to his defence and that the rejection of his application was a violation of his right to a fair trial.

The court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, directed the concerned cell-phone companies to preserve the call records till the defence evidence of the petitioner is not completed. However, the court also ordered that the concerned cell-phone companies shall not disclose the details of the records or the transcription available with them. This was done in order to protect the privacy of the police personnel involved in the case.

The court also ordered that the petitioner shall give an undertaking in writing before the trial Court to the effect that he shall not tamper with the said evidence and shall not try to influence or approach the officers concerned in this regard. This was done to ensure that the evidence is not tampered with and that the trial is conducted fairly.

In conclusion, the court has directed the concerned cell-phone companies to preserve the call records of the police personnel who apprehended the petitioner till the defence evidence of the petitioner is not completed. However, the details of the records or the transcription available with them shall not be disclosed. The petitioner has also been directed to give an undertaking in writing before the trial Court to the effect that he shall not tamper with the said evidence and shall not try to influence or approach the officers concerned in this regard. This order has been passed in order to protect the privacy of the police personnel involved in the case and to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly.
