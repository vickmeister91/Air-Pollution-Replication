The Rajasthan High Court recently dismissed a civil writ petition filed by M/s Shree Balaji Green Energy against the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board and others. The petition challenged an order passed by the Board, but the court held that since the petitioner had an alternative remedy available, the petition could not be entertained. However, the petitioner was allowed to take its statutory remedy as available in the law, and the Appellate Authority was directed to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing.

The case involved a dispute between M/s Shree Balaji Green Energy and the Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board. The petitioner had filed a writ petition challenging an order passed by the Board, which had directed the petitioner to pay a penalty for violating certain environmental norms. The petitioner had argued that the order was arbitrary and illegal, and had sought its quashing.

However, the court held that the petitioner had an alternative remedy available under the law, and therefore, the writ petition could not be entertained. The court noted that the petitioner could have filed an appeal before the Appellate Authority under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The court observed that the petitioner had not exhausted this remedy, and therefore, the writ petition was premature.

The court, however, allowed the petitioner to take its statutory remedy and directed the Appellate Authority to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing. The court also clarified that the Appellate Authority would be free to decide the appeal on its merits, without being influenced by the observations made in the writ petition.

The court's decision highlights the importance of exhausting alternative remedies before approaching the court. It also underscores the need for parties to comply with environmental norms and regulations, and the consequences of non-compliance.

In conclusion, the Rajasthan High Court's decision in the case of M/s Shree Balaji Green Energy v. Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board serves as a reminder that parties must exhaust alternative remedies before approaching the court. The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of complying with environmental norms and regulations, and the consequences of non-compliance. The court's direction to the Appellate Authority to dispose of the appeal within four weeks of its filing is a welcome move, as it will help expedite the resolution of disputes in a timely manner.
