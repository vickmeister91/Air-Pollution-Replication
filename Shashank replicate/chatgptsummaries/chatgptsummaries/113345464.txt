The Supreme Court of India has been approached by the Occupational Health and Safety Association with a writ petition seeking guidelines for occupational safety and health regulations to be maintained by various industries, the appointment of a committee to monitor the working of thermal power plants in India, compensation for workers who are victims of occupational health disorders, and the notification of recommendations as guidelines to be followed by thermal power plants. The court passed an interim order in 2008, accepting suggestions made to reduce occupational hazards for employees working in thermal power stations. The court reiterated the need for safe methods to be followed for the handling, collection, and disposal of hazardous waste in 2011. The National Institute of Occupational Health made recommendations in 2011, and the Central Government accepted suggestions no.1 to 7. The court reiterated the need for safe methods to be followed for the handling, collection, and disposal of hazardous waste in 2011.

The court order discusses the health hazards associated with working in coal-fired thermal power plants (CFTPPs) and makes recommendations for protecting workers' health and safety. The court suggests that High Courts in various states should examine whether there is an adequate health delivery system in place and whether effective medical treatment is being provided to workers in CFTPPs. The court is sending a copy of the judgment to the Chief Secretaries of the respective states and Registrar Generals of the High Courts in those states.

The court order requires the Secretary General of the Supreme Court to provide the Report of National Institute of Occupational Health titled "Environment, Health and Safety Issues in Coal Fired Thermal Power Plants" to the Registrar Generals of the High Courts of various states. The High Courts can examine the issues independently after calling for reports about the functioning of CFTPPs in their respective states. The Registrar Generals should place this judgment before the Chief Justices of the respective states to initiate suo moto proceedings in the interest of workers in CFTPPs. The Writ Petition is disposed of.
