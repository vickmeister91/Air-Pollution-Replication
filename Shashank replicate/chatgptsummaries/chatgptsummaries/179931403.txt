The case in question involves a petitioner who challenged an order passed by the Sessions Judge dismissing his application under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) for summoning certain documents. The petitioner argued that the application could be filed at any stage of the proceedings. However, the court found that the petitioner did not move for producing additional evidence before the appellate court and therefore, the summoning of documents was a futile exercise. The court dismissed the criminal misc. petition and the stay petition.

Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. deals with the power of the court to issue summons or order for the production of any document or other thing necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code. The section empowers the court to summon any person to produce a document or thing in his possession or control, and also to issue a search warrant for the same.

In the present case, the petitioner had filed an application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. before the Sessions Judge, seeking the summoning of certain documents. The Sessions Judge dismissed the application on the ground that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the documents before the appellate court. The petitioner then filed a criminal misc. petition before the High Court challenging the order of the Sessions Judge.

The petitioner argued before the High Court that the application under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. could be filed at any stage of the proceedings and that the Sessions Judge had erred in dismissing the application. However, the court found that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the documents before the appellate court and that the summoning of documents at this stage would be a futile exercise.

The court observed that the power under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is discretionary and that the court has to exercise its discretion judiciously. The court further observed that the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the documents before the appellate court and that the summoning of documents at this stage would not serve any useful purpose.

The court also noted that the petitioner had filed a stay petition along with the criminal misc. petition, seeking a stay on the proceedings before the trial court. The court found that the stay petition was also without merit and dismissed it along with the criminal misc. petition.

In conclusion, the court dismissed the criminal misc. petition and the stay petition filed by the petitioner, holding that the summoning of documents at this stage would be a futile exercise as the petitioner had not made any effort to produce the documents before the appellate court. The court also observed that the power under Section 91 of the Cr.P.C. is discretionary and has to be exercised judiciously.
