The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court recently reserved orders on a petition filed by Muthuraman and three others who were accused in a case under Sections 120-B (1), 148, 153-A (1)(b), 364, 302, 302 r/w 149 IPC. The petitioners had filed an application under Section 91 Cr.P.C. to send for the General Diaries of Thirukurungudi and Earvadi Police Stations for the period from 21.12.2015 to 31.12.2015. The Court below had dismissed the said petition, and the petitioners had challenged the order of dismissal. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that the documents sought to be sent for by the petitioners were essential and necessary to prove the case of the defence.

The court order states that the contents of a police diary are privileged and cannot be used by the defense except in accordance with specific provisions. The court is the ultimate custodian of justice and will ensure that the accused's interests are safeguarded. The denial of the right to inspect the case diary is not unreasonable or arbitrary, and it is not desirable to make the diary available to the accused on demand. The court also notes that the accused cannot force a police officer to refresh their memory by referring to entries in the diary.

The court dismisses a petition to produce the general diary of the respondent police, as the petitioners have not established the necessity or desirability of doing so. The court cites previous decisions that state that the accused cannot insist on the production of any document and that the production of a document must be necessary or desirable for the purpose of the trial. The court ultimately dismisses the petition.
