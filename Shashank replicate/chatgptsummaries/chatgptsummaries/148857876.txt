The court order in question relates to a criminal petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioners had sought to set aside an order passed by the District and Sessions Judge in a case. The court allowed the petitioners to recall two witnesses for cross-examination, but with the condition that their further examination would be completed on the same day without any adjournment.

The court's decision to allow the petitioners to recall two witnesses for cross-examination was based on the fact that the witnesses had given contradictory statements during their initial examination. The petitioners had argued that they needed to cross-examine the witnesses again in order to clarify the discrepancies in their statements.

However, the court was also mindful of the need to ensure that the trial did not drag on indefinitely. To this end, the court imposed the condition that the further examination of the witnesses would be completed on the same day without any adjournment. This was intended to prevent any unnecessary delays in the trial and to ensure that justice was served in a timely manner.

In addition to allowing the petitioners to recall the witnesses, the court also confirmed the rejection of an application filed under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code. This section allows a court to issue a summons or order for the production of any document or other thing that may be necessary or desirable for the purposes of any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code.

The application in question had been filed by the petitioners, who had sought to obtain certain documents from the prosecution. However, the court found that the documents in question were not relevant to the case and therefore rejected the application.

Overall, the court's order was aimed at ensuring that the trial proceeded in a fair and efficient manner. By allowing the petitioners to recall the witnesses for cross-examination, the court was able to address the discrepancies in their statements and ensure that all relevant evidence was considered. At the same time, the court's decision to impose a time limit on the further examination of the witnesses was intended to prevent any unnecessary delays in the trial.

Similarly, the court's decision to reject the application filed under Section 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code was based on the principle that only relevant evidence should be considered in a trial. By confirming the rejection of the application, the court was able to ensure that the trial remained focused on the issues at hand and that justice was served in a timely and efficient manner.

In conclusion, the court's order in this case was a balanced and pragmatic one, aimed at ensuring that the trial proceeded in a fair and efficient manner. By allowing the petitioners to recall the witnesses for cross-examination, the court was able to address the discrepancies in their statements and ensure that all relevant evidence was considered.
