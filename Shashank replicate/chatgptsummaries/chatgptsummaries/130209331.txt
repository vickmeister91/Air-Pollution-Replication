The court order in question pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Mohsim Ali against a judgment passed by the trial court, which found him guilty of contravening sections of the Wild Life (Prevention) Act, 1972. The appellant was ordered to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and pay a fine of Rs. 25,000, in default of which he was to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. The appeal challenges only the portion of the order that pertains to the default sentence.

The case against Mohsim Ali was that he was found in possession of a leopard skin, which is a prohibited item under the Wild Life (Prevention) Act, 1972. The trial court found him guilty of the offence and sentenced him to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000. The court also ordered that in default of payment of the fine, the appellant was to undergo simple imprisonment for six months.

The appellant filed an appeal against the order of the trial court, challenging only the portion of the order that pertains to the default sentence. The appellant argued that the sentence of six months of simple imprisonment was excessive and that it should be reduced.

The High Court, after hearing the arguments of both parties, modified the sentence to two months of simple imprisonment instead of six months. The court held that the sentence of six months of simple imprisonment was excessive and that a sentence of two months of simple imprisonment would be sufficient to meet the ends of justice.

The court observed that the appellant had already undergone three years of rigorous imprisonment and had paid a fine of Rs. 25,000. The court also noted that the appellant had no previous criminal record and that he was a first-time offender. The court took into consideration the fact that the appellant had already undergone a substantial portion of the sentence and that a reduction in the default sentence would not affect the overall sentence.

The court also observed that the purpose of the default sentence was to ensure that the fine is paid and that the appellant does not evade payment. The court held that a sentence of two months of simple imprisonment would be sufficient to achieve this purpose.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a criminal appeal filed by Mohsim Ali against a judgment passed by the trial court, which found him guilty of contravening sections of the Wild Life (Prevention) Act, 1972.
