The State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Punjab recently heard a complaint filed by Sangram Sandhu against Puma Realtor Pvt. Ltd. Sandhu alleged that Puma Realtor failed to deliver possession of a plot he purchased within the stipulated time and had no necessary permission or approval for the development of the project. Sandhu sought a refund of the amount paid along with interest, compensation for mental harassment, and litigation expenses. Puma Realtor denied the allegations and raised preliminary objections, including that the complaint was false and frivolous and that there was an arbitration clause in the buyer's agreement.

The Commission allowed Sandhu to amend his complaint and reduced his claim for interest, litigation expenses, and compensation. The court order allows an amendment to the complaint reducing the claim by the complainant. The court also states that an arbitration clause in the buyer's agreement does not prevent the consumer complaint from being maintainable. The court finds that the complainant is a consumer and that there is a relationship of consumer and service provider between the parties. 

The court examined the documents on the record and concluded that the complainant paid the total amount for the plot but did not receive possession due to deficiencies in the project. The court found that the developer had not completed the basic amenities and was not competent to offer possession without a completion certificate. The court ordered the developer to refund the entire deposited amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment and litigation expenses to the complainant. The court also found that the penalty clause for delay in possession would not be applicable in this case as the complainant was seeking a refund of the deposited amount.

This court order pertains to a consumer complaint against a real estate developer for not completing the development work and not delivering possession of the property to the complainant. The court found that the developer had not completed the basic amenities and was not competent to offer possession without a completion certificate. The court ordered the developer to refund the entire deposited amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment and litigation expenses to the complainant. 

In conclusion, the court found in favor of the complainant and ordered the developer to refund the entire deposited amount with interest, pay compensation for mental harassment and litigation expenses to the complainant. The court also found that the penalty clause for delay in possession would not be applicable in this case as the complainant was seeking a refund of the deposited amount. The court's decision sets a precedent for consumer complaints against real estate developers who fail to deliver possession of properties within the stipulated time and without the necessary permissions and approvals. It also highlights the importance of completing basic amenities and obtaining completion certificates before offering possession of properties to buyers.
