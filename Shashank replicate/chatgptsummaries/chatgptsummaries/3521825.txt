The Custom, Excise & Service Tax Tribunal in Chennai recently heard 29 appeals from Integra Software Services Pvt. Ltd. regarding the refund of unutilized CENVAT credit on export of services under Rule 5 of Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 (CCR). The company had availed input credit of various input services and used them for rendering the output services exported. While the original adjudicating authority had granted refund, the revenue had appealed, stating that certain services were not eligible for CENVAT Credit and that documents were not proper for claim of credit. The Commissioner (Appeals) had partially allowed the appeals. The issues involved in these appeals were identical in nature. The court found that rent has a direct nexus with the output service provided by the appellants and hence is eligible for the credit. Credit on renting of immovable property is eligible for the appellants.

The court order discusses the eligibility of various expenses for refund under CENVAT Credit. The court allows credit for expenses related to transportation, consultancy, antecedent charges, housekeeping, insurance, subscription charges, delivery fee, customs house agents, sewage treatment, air travel agent, chartered accountant service, commercial coaching and training charges, manpower recruitment and supply agent, and legal consultancy services. However, credit is not allowed for meal coupons. The court also addresses procedural issues related to the rejection of refund on the grounds of non-availability of registration details of input service providers, improper description of input service, and service tax not claimed in invoices. The court sets aside the impugned order and allows all appeals in the above terms.
