The court order pertains to five different cases involving disputes between the complainant and the accused over contracts for telecast of advertisements. The accused in all the cases were alleged to have stopped payment on post-dated cheques issued to the complainant for the telecast of advertisements. The court examined the evidence presented by the complainant and the accused and made judgments based on the facts of each case.

In the first case, the accused, Zeal Infotainment and its proprietor Amir Khusro, were alleged to have stopped payment on post-dated cheques issued to Star India Pvt. Ltd. for telecast of advertisements. The accused pleaded not guilty, claiming that the complainant had not fulfilled their part of the contract. The court found no evidence of the offence and acquitted the accused. The order also details the evidence presented by the complainant, including testimony and copies of cheques and other documents.

In the second case, the accused had issued several cheques to the complainant, which were subsequently returned unpaid due to stop payment instructions. The court found that the cheques were indeed issued by the accused and presented within the statutory period of six months. The cheques were returned unpaid for the reason of stop payment instructions, which raises a question of law as to whether a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act would be maintainable in such a case. The court also called for authenticated statements of accounts of the accused before pronouncing judgment.

In the third case, the court discussed whether a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is maintainable if a cheque is dishonoured due to stop payment instructions. The court found that such a complaint is maintainable and that the burden of proving the accused's innocence lies on them. The court also examined whether the complainant made a demand for the cheque amount within the statutory period, whether the accused failed to meet the demand within the statutory period, and whether the complaint was made within the statutory period. The court found that all these conditions were met. However, the accused successfully raised a probable defense of breach of contract on the part of the complainant, which raised a serious doubt as to whether the complainant complied with the release order or with the deal. The accused thus rebuts the presumption raised in favor of the complainant under the mandate of section 139 N.I Act. The court found that the complainant failed to prove its case beyond a shadow of a doubt.

In the fourth case, the court discussed a dispute between the complainant and the accused regarding a contract for telecast schedule. The accused presented evidence, including the original deal and release order, communications between the parties, and telecast certificates. The court found that a commercial entitlement was missing from the release order, but the complainant had still telecast advertisements during that time. The court listed several alleged breaches of the schedule and noted that some were not covered by the complaint.

In the fifth case, the court discussed a dispute over a deal between the complainant and the accused for telecasting advertisements. The court concluded that the deal was a proposal by the complainant and not a promise by the accused, and that the release order was a counter-proposal. The complainant accepted the release order by accepting the accompanying cheques and proceeding with the telecast of advertisements. However, there was a partial breach of contract by the complainant, and the liability of the accused should be proportionately reduced. The accused is acquitted of the offense under section 138 of the N.I Act.

In all the cases, the court examined the evidence presented by both parties and made judgments based on the facts of each case. The court also examined the legal provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act and other relevant laws to arrive at its decisions. The judgments highlight the importance of fulfilling contractual obligations and the consequences of breaching them. They also emphasize the need for clear and unambiguous contracts to avoid disputes and legal complications.
