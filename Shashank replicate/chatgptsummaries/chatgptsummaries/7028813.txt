The Rajasthan High Court recently issued a court order in response to a group of writ petitions filed by various individuals and companies against the State of Rajasthan and others. The petitioners challenged the constitutionality of Section 29 of the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953, which allows the government to declare forest land as protected forest. They argued that the provision is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21, and 300A of the Constitution of India. The petitioners also challenged the government's notification declaring their mining leases as protected forest.

The State argued that the provision is necessary to protect forest land and waste land during the interregnum period before final notification under Section 29(1) is issued. The court noted the importance of protecting the environment and preserving forest cover and wildlife, and cited previous cases where the Supreme Court has intervened in public interest to protect these resources.

The court order discussed various cases where the Apex Court intervened to protect and preserve forest cover, ecology, environment, and wildlife. The court appointed committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife. The court also emphasized the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle.

The court suspended mining activities in certain areas to protect the environment and ecology. The court upheld the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area. The court dismissed the writ petitions and left the parties to bear their own costs.

The court's decision to uphold the State Government's decision to declare an area as a protected forest and restrain mining operations in the area is a significant victory for environmental protection. The court's emphasis on the principles of sustainable development and the precautionary principle is also noteworthy, as it highlights the need to balance economic development with environmental protection.

The court's decision to appoint committees to ensure enforcement of state notifications and orders of the Supreme Court to prevent devastation of the environment and wildlife is also a positive step. This will help to ensure that environmental protection laws are effectively enforced and that violators are held accountable.

Overall, the court's order is a significant step towards protecting the environment and preserving forest cover and wildlife in Rajasthan. It highlights the importance of balancing economic development with environmental protection and emphasizes the need to enforce environmental protection laws effectively.
