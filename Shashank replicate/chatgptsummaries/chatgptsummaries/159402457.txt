ICICI Bank filed a petition under section 482 of Cr.P.C. against an order passed by the First Additional Sessions Judge, Gwalior in Criminal Revision No. 234/2014. The revision filed by the applicant was dismissed and the order passed by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Gwalior in an unregistered complaint was affirmed.
