The Gujarat High Court has recently allowed a petition filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to quash and set aside an order passed by a lower court discharging accused persons for offences punishable under Sections 43 and 44 read with 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The lower court had discharged the accused persons on the ground that the petitioner, who filed the complaint, was not authorised to do so. However, the High Court held that the decision of the learned Single Judge in the case of Nicosulf Industries & Exports Private Limited and others (Supra) has not been accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.

The case pertains to the discharge of untreated effluent into a water body by the accused persons, which is a violation of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board had filed a complaint against the accused persons for the said violation. However, the lower court had discharged the accused persons on the ground that the petitioner, who filed the complaint, was not authorised to do so.

The High Court, while allowing the petition filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, observed that the learned Single Judge in the case of Nicosulf Industries & Exports Private Limited and others (Supra) had held that a complaint under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 can be filed only by an officer authorised by the State Board. However, the High Court noted that the said decision has not been accepted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside.

The High Court further observed that the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 do not require that a complaint can be filed only by an officer authorised by the State Board. The High Court also noted that the Gujarat Pollution Control Board is a statutory body established under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and is empowered to take action against the violators of the said Act.

The High Court, while setting aside the order passed by the lower court, directed the lower court to proceed with the trial in accordance with law. The High Court also observed that the accused persons can raise the issue of lack of authorisation of the petitioner to file the complaint before the trial court.

In conclusion, the Gujarat High Court has allowed a petition filed by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to quash and set aside an order passed by a lower court discharging accused persons for offences punishable under Sections 43 and 44 read with 47 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974.
