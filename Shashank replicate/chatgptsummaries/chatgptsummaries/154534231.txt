The Kerala High Court issued a judgment on June 27, 2011, after hearing three writ petitions jointly. The case pertained to a brick kiln that was causing pollution and health hazards in the locality.

The court considered the degree of pollution and nuisance caused by the unit and ordered further investigation. The court disposed of the writ petitions with a direction to the Environmental Engineer and District Medical Officer to conduct an inspection into the premises and submit reports regarding the degree of pollution, nuisance, and health hazard.
