The court order in question pertains to a writ petition filed by Rati Ram, who sought the quashing of an order by the STA Board cancelling the permit granted to him for a bus. The cancellation was due to an unauthorized transfer of the permit to Gulab Singh. The petitioner claimed that the transfer was only a power of attorney issued in 1997, which was revoked in 1998, and that a mutual settlement was reached between the parties. However, the court found that the power of attorney was irrevocable and conferred almost every right short of formal ownership on the attorney holder, and that the settlement resulted in the petitioner becoming the sole owner of the bus and permit.

The court held that the cancellation was in compliance with the directions given by the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta's case and dismissed the writ petition. The court's decision was based on the fact that the transfer of the permit was unauthorized and violated the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The court also noted that the transfer was made without the prior approval of the STA Board, which is the competent authority to grant and cancel permits.

The court further observed that the power of attorney was not a mere authorization to operate the bus, but a transfer of the permit itself. The court held that the power of attorney was irrevocable and conferred almost every right short of formal ownership on the attorney holder. The court also noted that the petitioner had failed to produce any evidence to show that the power of attorney was revoked in 1998.

The court also rejected the petitioner's claim that a mutual settlement was reached between the parties. The court held that the settlement resulted in the petitioner becoming the sole owner of the bus and permit. The court observed that the settlement was not registered and did not comply with the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908. The court also noted that the settlement was not supported by any documentary evidence.

The court held that the cancellation of the permit was in compliance with the directions given by the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta's case. The court observed that the Supreme Court had directed the authorities to cancel permits that were obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. The court held that the transfer of the permit was unauthorized and violated the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The court also noted that the transfer was made without the prior approval of the STA Board, which is the competent authority to grant and cancel permits.

In conclusion, the court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Rati Ram seeking the quashing of an order by the STA Board cancelling the permit granted to him for a bus. The court found that the transfer of the permit was unauthorized and violated the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The court also held that the power of attorney was irrevocable and conferred almost every right short of formal ownership on the attorney holder, and that the settlement resulted in the petitioner becoming the sole owner of the bus and permit. The court held that the cancellation was in compliance with the directions given by the Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta's case and dismissed the writ petition.
