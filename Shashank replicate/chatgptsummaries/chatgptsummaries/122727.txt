The court orders discussed in this summary all pertain to cases where individuals or businesses claimed deductions for certain expenses under various sections of the Income Tax Act. In the first case, an individual claimed expenses incurred on a coronary bypass operation as a deduction under Section 31 or Section 37 of the Income Tax Act. The Assessing Officer rejected the claim, stating that the expenditure was personal in nature and not wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business or profession. The Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) affirmed the view of the Assessing Officer. The court was asked to decide whether the expenses incurred should have been allowed as a deduction. The court examined the arguments made by the petitioner and the Assessing Officer and ultimately upheld the decision of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals).

Similarly, in another case, a lawyer claimed deductions for expenses incurred on a medical procedure to enhance his professional efficacy. The Assessing Officer and the CIT(A) rejected the claim, and the Tribunal upheld their decision, stating that the heart is not a tool of the lawyer's trade. The court cites precedents where expenses directly and immediately beneficial to the trade were allowed as deductions. However, in this case, the expenses were not directly related to the lawyer's profession, and the court rejected the claim for deductions.

In the third case, an assessee carried on the business of running tea and coffee estates, and coffee curing, with a common head office. The issue was whether the entire depreciation in respect of assets in the head office would be deductible from the taxable income. The court held that as long as the expenditure was incurred for the purposes of business, and merely because some other person or activity was also benefitted by such an expenditure, it would not come in the way of the assessee being allowed a deduction. The court also examined other cases where the definition of a plant was discussed.

The fourth case discussed the definition of "plant" under section 32 of the IT Act and how it includes articles that have a degree of durability and are used as tools of the assessee's trade. The court also examined a case where technical know-how supplied by a foreign collaborator was considered a depreciable asset. The court ultimately concludes that deduction under section 31 of the IT Act would not be available for expenses incurred on a coronary by-pass surgery as the heart cannot be considered a plant and would not have a cost of acquisition.

In the final case, the petitioner's claim for deduction of expenses incurred on coronary surgery under section 31 of the IT Act was rejected by the court, stating that the heart cannot be considered a tool for engaging in trade or professional activity. The court also rejected the petitioner's claim under section 37 of the IT Act, stating that the expenses incurred on the surgery did not have a direct or immediate nexus with the petitioner's efficiency in the professional field. The court upheld the judgments and orders of the authorities below and answered the question of law in the negative against the petitioner.

Overall, these court orders highlight the importance of understanding the specific provisions of the Income Tax Act and the criteria for claiming deductions. While some expenses may be directly related to a profession or business and therefore deductible, others may not meet the necessary criteria and may be rejected by the authorities and the courts. It is important for individuals and businesses to seek professional advice and guidance to ensure compliance with the Income Tax Act and avoid any potential legal issues.
