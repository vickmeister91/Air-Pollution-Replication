The court order in question pertains to a bail application filed by Bhagaram in connection with an FIR registered against him under the Prohibition Act. The court has allowed the application and ordered his release on regular bail on certain conditions. These conditions include a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and surrendering his passport. Additionally, the court has directed him to mark his presence at the police station every month and not leave the country without prior permission. It is important to note that the trial court has the authority to modify or relax any of these conditions.

Bhagaram's bail application was filed in response to an FIR registered against him under the Prohibition Act. The Prohibition Act is a law that prohibits the manufacture, sale, and consumption of alcohol in certain states in India. The exact nature of the allegations against Bhagaram is not clear from the available information. However, it is likely that he was accused of violating the Prohibition Act in some way.

The court has allowed Bhagaram's bail application and ordered his release on regular bail. Regular bail is a type of bail that is granted to a person who has been arrested and is awaiting trial. It allows the person to be released from custody while they await trial. Regular bail is usually granted on certain conditions, such as the payment of a bond or the surrender of a passport.

In Bhagaram's case, the court has ordered him to pay a personal bond of Rs. 10,000 and surrender his passport. A personal bond is a type of bond that is signed by the person seeking bail. It is a promise to pay a certain amount of money if the person fails to comply with the conditions of their bail. Surrendering his passport means that Bhagaram will not be able to leave the country while he is out on bail.

In addition to these conditions, the court has also directed Bhagaram to mark his presence at the police station every month. This means that he will have to go to the police station and sign a register to show that he is complying with the conditions of his bail. The court has also directed him not to leave the country without prior permission. This means that if Bhagaram needs to travel outside of India for any reason, he will have to seek permission from the court before doing so.

It is important to note that the trial court has the authority to modify or relax any of these conditions. This means that if Bhagaram is able to show good cause, the court may be willing to modify the conditions of his bail. For example, if Bhagaram needs to travel outside of India for a medical emergency, the court may be willing to grant him permission to do so.

In conclusion, the court has allowed Bhagaram's bail application and ordered his release on regular bail on certain conditions. These conditions include a personal bond of Rs. 10,000, surrendering his passport, marking his presence at the police station every month, and not leaving the country without prior permission. The trial court has the authority to modify or relax any of these conditions if Bhagaram is able to show good cause.
