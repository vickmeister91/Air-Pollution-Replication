The court order pertains to a writ petition filed by Nipun Malhotra, who has severe locomotor disability, against the acquisition of standard floor buses by the Government of NCT of Delhi. The petitioner argued that the acquisition of such buses would deprive persons with disabilities and senior citizens of access to public transport. The court recorded its reasons for prohibiting the respondents from acquiring standard floor buses and referred to a training programme conducted in 2014, where a transgender activist had asked the question, "Am I invisible?" The court noted that persons with disabilities in Delhi were experiencing the same invisibility and non-existence despite constitutional recognition of their rights and statutory provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016.

The court order discusses two separate petitions challenging the procurement of buses by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. The first petition, filed in October 2017, sought to stop the purchase of 2000 non-disabled friendly standard floor buses and instead procure disabled-friendly low-floor buses. The second petition, filed in April 2018, sought to quash the tender for the procurement of 1000 standard floor buses. The Transport Department of GNCTD has placed a short note on a scheme for running "cluster buses" in Delhi to replace the erstwhile 'Blue-Line' buses. The court order includes details of the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers and the Transport Department regarding the procurement of buses.

The court order discusses the appointment of Delhi Integrated Multi Modal Transit System (DIMTS) to manage and oversee the operation of cluster buses in Delhi. The order also mentions the tender process for the induction of 1000 additional buses in rural areas. The court has prohibited the acquisition of standard floor buses due to concerns of discrimination against persons with disabilities. The order cites international conventions and India's Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 to support this decision. The court has not yet heard from all parties involved and the reasons for the prohibition are not final.

The court order defines terms related to disability discrimination and outlines rules for accessibility and transportation for persons with disabilities. The government is required to formulate rules for accessibility standards in urban and rural areas, including transportation and information and communication technologies. The appropriate government must also provide facilities and retrofit old modes of transport to accommodate persons with disabilities. The order also mandates training on disability rights for various professionals and requires social audits of programs involving persons with disabilities. The Central Government is given the power to make rules for carrying out the provisions of the Act. The Harmonised Guidelines and Space Standards for Barrier Free Built Environment for Persons With Disabilities and Elderly Persons are also referenced, which provide explicit imperatives for public transport to accommodate persons with disabilities.

The court order mandates that new vehicles must comply with accessibility standards for people with disabilities, and travel routes to bus stops should also be barrier-free. Accessible buses must have features such as wide doors, low floors, handrails, and wheelchair spaces with stoppers and safety belts. Alighting buzzers and information signs must also be provided. The order is based on guidelines that ensure equality for persons with disabilities and elderly persons. The court cites previous orders and judicial precedents that emphasize the importance of public safety and reducing accidents, particularly by buses. The Delhi Transport Corporation is directed to take effective and adequate steps to bring the directions to the notice of the public.

The court order discusses the purchase of low floor buses with enhanced safety features and disabled-friendly facilities by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The court directs that all local buses in Delhi must be low floor buses and only such vehicles will be registered by the authorities. The order also highlights the need for disabled-friendly bus stands and facilities. The judgment dated 26th March, 2007 was not challenged by the Government of NCT of Delhi or the DTC and has attained finality. The order emphasizes the importance of treating persons with disabilities with utmost dignity and ensuring proper and adequate access to public places.

The court order pertains to a writ petition filed in the Supreme Court of India seeking proper and adequate access to public places for differently-abled persons, particularly those with visual disabilities. The court noted that such access is a right that flows from various international covenants to which India is a signatory. The court also highlighted the duty of the state to make provisions for safeguarding the interests of handicapped persons and noted the provisions of the Disabilities Act, 1995 and the Disabilities Act, 2016. The court further noted that the prayers made in the petition cannot be viewed as adversarial in nature and that the Union of India has been taking various measures to make the lives of disabled persons as comfortable as possible. The court also referred to an affidavit filed by the petitioner in response to a status report filed by the Union of India, which depicted what remains to be done at the end of the respondents.

The court order discusses the government's proposal to make 10% of public transport fully accessible to persons with disabilities by March 2018. The court notes that the Disabilities Act, 2016 mandates the government to make provisions for such facilities and specifies deadlines for undertaking these measures. The court directs the government to ensure that all government buses are disabled-friendly and that private buses also become disabled-friendly. The court also directs the Bureau of Indian Standards to embed disability aspects in all relevant parts of the revised National Building Code. The court emphasizes the importance of non-discrimination and equality guaranteed by the Constitution.
